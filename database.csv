"world - wide  infertility affects 1015% of couples who are trying to conceive  and about 15% of these cases are caused by male factors  which affect 1 out of 20 men in the general population . 
 most cases of male infertility are idiopathic  apart from several etiologies  such as obstruction of deferent duct  varicocele  sexual dysfunction  and cryptorchidism . 
 although assisted reproductive technology ( art ) has helped many sterile couples to conceive  non - obstructive azoospermia ( noa )  which accounts for a considerable proportion of male infertility  has a dramatically lower rate of sperm retrieval and clinical pregnancy . 
 the etiological mechanism of noa is unknown  but factors such as oxidative stress were considered to have effects on spermatogenesis  and some antioxidants have been effective in protecting spermatogenesis . 
 therefore  it is helpful to explore the underlying pathogenesis of noa in these patients . micrornas are a class of small rnas that do not code amino acid sequences  but they play fundamental roles in regulating gene expression after transcription . 
 lian et al . found 154 down - regulated mirnas and 19 up - regulated mirnas in testes of noa patients compared to fertile males  by using microarray technologies . 
 furthermore  some of the mirnas have been shown to affect the proliferation  apoptosis  and dna damage in germ cells [ 911 ] . 
 mir-210 is one of the 19 up - regulated mirnas in testes of noa patients  located within the genomic loci of transcript ak123483 . 
 it can be induced by hypoxia  and plays an essential role in cell adaptation to hypoxia . 
 mir-210 also affects regulation of diverse physiological processes  such as angiogenesis  cell survival  proliferation  cell cycle arrest  protein modification  and dna damage repair . 
 although mir-210 has been shown to be involved in regulation of physiological processes in various diseases and to be an up - regulated mirna in testes of noa patients  it remains unknown how mir-210 affects spermatogenesis . 
 hence  the aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which mir-210 is involved in the pathogenesis of spermatogenesis . 
 we enrolled 25 patients ( aged 1841 years ) with azoospermia ( proven by 3 semen analyses from testicular biopsies from the first affiliated hospital of anhui medical university ) . 
 pathological examinations were performed on each testicular specimen . combined with clinical features  4 patients were diagnosed as having sertoli - cell - only syndrome ( scos )  7 patients were diagnosed as having maturation arrest ( ma )  8 patients were diagnosed as having hypospermatogenesis  and the other 6 patients were diagnosed as having obstructive azoospermia ( oa ) . all patients provided informed consent before their participation in this study . 
 our local medical ethics committee approved this study before it began . to examine the location of insulin - like growth factor ii 
 ( igf2 ) in human testicular tissues  we performed immunohistochemistry staining to detect the igf2 expression . 
 tissues were cut into sections for immunoperoxidase staining after being treated with 4% pfa and paraffin wax . 
 after the specific treatment with standard - procedure immunohistochemistry staining as described as lian et al .  sections were incubated with igf2 antibody ( abcam ) overnight at 4c and biotinylated secondary antibody ( abcam ) for 2 h at room temperature . to detect expression of mir-210  
 rnas were extracted from nt-2 cells or tissues and subjected to real - time pcr as described as lian et al . . 
 briefly  rna extraction was performed following a standard trizol protocol  real - time pcr was carried out with the abi step one system ( applied biosystems )  and the sybr premix ex taq ii kit ( takara bio  inc . ) was used . 
 primers for q - rt pcr were as follows : forward primer : 5-caataactgtgcgtgtgacagc-3 reverse primer : 5-tatggttttgacgactgtgtgat-3 forward primer : 5-cagcacatatactaaaattggaacg-3 reverse primer : 5-acgaatttgcgtgtcatcc-3 western blot analysis was carried out to detect protein expression of igf2 in the human testicular tissues in the 3 groups and in nt2 cells . 
 anti - igf2 ( abcam ) was used for western blot analysis  and we used -actin as a loading control to detect expression of igf2 . 
 we supplemented the medium with 10% fetal bovine serum ( life technology inc . )  1% antibiotics ( 100 units / ml penicillin  and 100 ug / ml streptomycin  life technology inc . ) . 
 cells were incubated at 37c in a humidified incubator with 5% co2 . to transfect oligonucleotides and plasmids into nt-2 cells  lipofectamine rnaimax ( invitrogen ) and fugene hd ( roche ) 
 all processes were performed in accordance with the protocols supplied by manufacturers . in this study  all the experiments were performed independently at least 3 times .

 the igf2 gene is part of a cluster of imprinted genes expressing the single polypeptide as igf2  which is only produced from the paternal allele . 
 the maternal allele is transcriptionally silent . to clarify the location of igf2 in human testicular tissues  
 we found igf2 located in spermatocytes in the testes of patients with oa ( figure 1 ) . because igf2 is located in spermatocytes of the testis  we detected the expression of igf2 in cases with ma  hypospermatogenesis  and oa  but not in the scos patients . 
 we found that igf2 was down - regulated in patients with ma and hypospermatogenesis compared to oa patients  which was considered as the control group with normal spermatogenesis  although without a significant difference ( figures 2  3 )  possibly because there were fewer samples and longer preservation times of some samples . 
 quantitative real - time pcr was performed to examined mir-210 expression in the testis of patients with ma  hypospermatogenesis  and oa . we found that mir-210 was significantly up - regulated in the testis of ma and hypospermatogenesis patients compared to oa patients ( figure 4 ) . however  due to errors in the rna extraction in the preliminary experiment  3 testis samples ( 1 each ) from ma  hypospermatogenesis  and oa patients were damaged and were not tested . in the targetscan database  because the 3utr of the igf2-mrna has a putative mir-210-binding site  igf2 was predicted to be a potential target of mir-210 . to identify whether the igf2 gene was targeted by mir-210 directly  renilla luciferase reporters  which include the wild - type full - length 3utr forms of mir-210 seeding sites  
 figure 5 shows that there was a 60% decrease in luciferase activity after cotransfection of the mir-210 mimic and the renilla luciferase reporters into nt2 cells  and inhibiting mir-210 expression increased activity of the reporter renilla luciferase . 
 expression of igf2 protein was also significantly lower in the nt2 cells transfected with mir-210 mimics than in control cells  and knockdown of mir-210 with mir-210 inhibitor increased protein expression of igf2 ( figures 6 ) . 
 the igf2 gene is part of a cluster of imprinted genes expressing the single polypeptide as igf2  which is only produced from the paternal allele . 
 the maternal allele is transcriptionally silent . to clarify the location of igf2 in human testicular tissues  
 we found igf2 located in spermatocytes in the testes of patients with oa ( figure 1 ) . 
 because igf2 is located in spermatocytes of the testis  we detected the expression of igf2 in cases with ma  hypospermatogenesis  and oa  but not in the scos patients . 
 we found that igf2 was down - regulated in patients with ma and hypospermatogenesis compared to oa patients  which was considered as the control group with normal spermatogenesis  although without a significant difference ( figures 2  3 )  possibly because there were fewer samples and longer preservation times of some samples . 
 quantitative real - time pcr was performed to examined mir-210 expression in the testis of patients with ma  hypospermatogenesis  and oa . we found that mir-210 was significantly up - regulated in the testis of ma and hypospermatogenesis patients compared to oa patients ( figure 4 ) . however  due to errors in the rna extraction in the preliminary experiment  3 testis samples ( 1 each ) from ma  hypospermatogenesis  and oa patients were damaged and were not tested . 
 in the targetscan database  because the 3utr of the igf2-mrna has a putative mir-210-binding site  igf2 was predicted to be a potential target of mir-210 . to identify whether the igf2 gene was targeted by mir-210 directly  renilla luciferase reporters  which include the wild - type full - length 3utr forms of mir-210 seeding sites  were used . 
 figure 5 shows that there was a 60% decrease in luciferase activity after cotransfection of the mir-210 mimic and the renilla luciferase reporters into nt2 cells  and inhibiting mir-210 expression increased activity of the reporter renilla luciferase . 
 expression of igf2 protein was also significantly lower in the nt2 cells transfected with mir-210 mimics than in control cells  and knockdown of mir-210 with mir-210 inhibitor increased protein expression of igf2 ( figures 6 ) . 
 during recent decades several studies have focused on the effects of mirnas on spermatogenesis in male infertility [ 91117 ] . 
 however  it was not understood how mir-210  which is one of the up - regulated mirnas in testes of patients with noa  was involved in spermatogenesis in male infertility . 
 the transformation of diploid spermatogonia into mature haploid cells in spermatogenesis is a complex biological process in the testes of males . 
 the insulin / igf system takes part in the processes of cell proliferation  cell growth  differentiation  and survival  which affects nearly every organ in the body . 
 also  insulin / igf plays an important role in the proper function of the testis in males . 
 igf2 binds to igf1r and insr - a with a high affinity and binds to insr - a / igf1r  insr - b / igf1r  but with lower affinity . 
 found that in inactivated insr and igf1r  there was a 79% reduction in daily sperm production in adult mouse testes by a conditional ko approach . taken together  the aforementioned data suggest that igf2 might be involved in the process of spermatogenesis . to examine the specific mechanism by which mir-210 is associated with the process of spermatogenesis  quantitative real - time pcr was performed to detect mir-210 expression . 
 we found that mir-210 was significantly up - regulated in the testes of subjects with ma and hypospermatogenesis patients compared to oa . 
 these results agree with findings of lian et al . using microarray technologies performed in noa and normal controls . 
 several studies have suggested that this mirna could be mediated by hypoxia and participate in various types of regulation of angiogenesis  cell survival  proliferation  cell cycle arrest  and protein modification [ 1214 ] . 
 furthermore  some researchers even found that mir-210 might be considered as one of the indicated markers in some diseases  such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia . in the present study we found that igf2 was targeted by mir-210 directly in the in vitro experiment in nt2 cells  and mir-210 might be associated with spermatogenesis by targeting igf2 in male infertility . 
 firstly  as some errors occurred in the rna extraction in the preliminary experiment  mir-210 of 3 testes samples were damaged and not detected in the subsequent quantitative real - time pcr experiment  which might have affected our results . 
 secondly  we did not investigate the functions of mir-210 and igf2 in vitro or in vivo  and we plan to do this in future research . 
 we demonstrated that mir-210 might be associated with spermatogenesis by targeting igf2 in male infertility . 
 future mechanistic studies on the role of mir-210/igf2 in the process of spermatogenesis in male infertility will provide new insights into the diagnosis and management of male infertility .","

1) Abstract: Micrornas (miRNAs) have been found to play crucial roles in spermatogenesis. This study investigates the potential involvement of miR-210 in the testes of men with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). Results suggest that miR-210 may target insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) in NOA patients, potentially affecting spermatogenesis. 

2) Research and Discussion: The expression of miR-210 and IGF2 was examined in the testes of NOA patients and compared to obstructive azoospermia patients. MiR-210 was significantly up-regulated in NOA cases, while IGF2 was down-regulated, but without significant difference. Results in NT2 cells suggest that miR-210 may directly target IGF2. 

3) Results and Conclusion: This study reveals that miR-210 may play a role in spermatogenesis in NOA patients by targeting IGF2. This suggests a potential mechanism for male infertility and highlights the importance of further research on miRNAs in male reproductive health."
"midwife - led primary delivery care for  low - risk  pregnant women during labor has been reported to have various advantages  such as increased odds of high maternal satisfaction and a decrease of unnecessary medical interventions [ 18 ] . 
 although the maternity care system for  low - risk  pregnant women peculiar to one country can not easily be compared with those in other countries  consumer demands for the  humanization  of obstetric care have arisen in various countries [ 18 ] . to date  we have found no evidence that midwife - led primary obstetric care is unsafe for  low - risk  pregnant women in comparison with obstetric care with the favorable cooperation of obstetricians and midwives in japan [ 912 ] . 
 in addition  about 85% of  low - risk  pregnant women request that they give birth while receiving midwife - led primary delivery care . 
 therefore  safe midwife - led delivery care with the backup of obstetricians may also be required for  low - risk  pregnant women in japan . if complications occur or threaten to occur during the primary midwife - led delivery care  the midwives have to refer the woman to obstetricians at the same or a neighboring hospital or private obstetric clinic as soon as possible . 
 this is because  in deliveries managed by independent midwives in japan  many intervention measures  such as oxytocin infusion  epidural anesthesia  episiotomy  suture  and instrumental delivery  are not available based on japanese legal restrictions . in our institute  one of the main tokyo city perinatal centers  there are 3 japanese systems of midwife - led delivery care  as follows : ( 1 ) those intending to give birth at home managed by midwives who do not belong to our hospital  ( 2 ) those planning to give birth on  futons 
 ( i.e.  japanese - style bedding ) in japanese tatami mat delivery rooms in our hospital managed by the same midwives who do not belong to our hospital  and ( 3 ) those planning to give birth in japanese tatami mat delivery rooms managed by midwives who belong to our hospital . 
 the objective of this study was to describe trends in transfers and perinatal outcomes among labors using these 3 japanese systems of midwife - led primary delivery care . 
 the protocol for this analysis was approved by the ethics committee of the japanese red cross katsushika maternity hospital . in addition  
 informed consent for analysis from a retrospective database was obtained from each subject during their hospital visit . in our hospital  
 pregnant women who are initially considered  low - risk  at 3436 weeks of gestation can choose freely between the 3 systems of midwife - led care and obstetric shared care . 
 in the midwife - led care units  midwives can practice autonomously and are fully accountable for their own practice  unsupervised by obstetricians . 
 factors used to exclude women from the  low - risk  group comprise the following [ 912 ] : ( 1 ) medical history : pregnancy - induced hypertension  chronic hypertension  diabetes mellitus  renal disease  idiopathic thrombocytopenia  and other systemic illnesses ; ( 2 ) gynecological history : history of infertility therapies of in vitro fertilization  congenital uterine anomalies  uterine myomatosis  and adnexal anomaly ; ( 3 ) obstetric history : narrowing of the pelvic outlet  cephalopelvic disproportion  previous cesarean section  previous anal sphincter injury  previous postpartum hemorrhage  1000  ml with blood transfusion  previous manual removal of placenta  previous gestational diabetes  and history of severe preeclampsia ; ( 4 ) complications during the present pregnancy : multiple pregnancy  nonvertex presentation  obesity ( maternal body mass index before pregnancy  25 and/or during the third trimester  28 )  anemia ( hemoglobin < 9.0  g / dl )  epilepsy with treatment  polyhydramnios  oligohydramnios  low - set placenta  placenta previa  fetal growth restriction  heavy for date fetus  gestational diabetes  and pregnancy - induced hypertension ; when risk factors are present  those women are managed by obstetricians and midwives ; ( 5 ) complications during labor : intrauterine infection  thick meconium staining  prolongation of labor such as active - phase dilation < 1  cm / hour and duration of second stage of labor  2 hours  prolonged rupture of membranes ( 24 hours )  uterine inertia  arrest of labor  and fetal heart rate abnormality such as a nonreassuring fetal status . when these factors are present  the women are transferred to be managed mainly by obstetricians ( obstetric shared care ) in a standard western - style delivery room or surgery room in our hospital . 
 a retrospective study was performed to examine trends in transfers and perinatal outcomes among labors that started using the 3 systems of midwife - led primary delivery care . in this study  
 student 's t - test was used for continuous variables and the  test for categorical variables . 
 odds ratios ( ors ) and 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) were also calculated . differences with p 
 between 2009 and 2012  a total of 678 low - risk women were placed in the 3 forms of midwife - led primary delivery care at the onset of labor pains and/or rupture of membranes at 3741 weeks of gestation . of these  
 123 ( 18% ) intended to give birth at home  88 ( 13% ) planned to give birth in the japanese tatami mat rooms in our hospital managed by midwives who do not belong to our hospital  and 467 ( 59% ) planned to give birth managed by the midwives belonging to our hospital . 
 table 1 shows the clinical descriptions of the 678 pregnant women initially considered as  low - risk  for receiving our midwife - led primary delivery care systems . there were no significant differences in the maternal age or parity among the 3 groups . 
 table 2 shows the rate of transfers in the 3 groups of the midwife - led primary delivery care systems . 
 the total rate of transfers in the system run by the midwives belonging to our hospital ( 56% ) was higher than in the other 2 systems run by the independent midwives ( 31% in planned home birth : or 1.87  95% ci 1.23.0  p < 0.01 ; 38% in planned hospital birth : or 2.51  95% ci 1.73.8  p < 0.01 ) . 
 in addition  the timing of transfers in the system run by the midwives belonging to our hospital ( before the second stage of labor : 52% ) was earlier than those in the other 2 systems ( 21% in the planned home birth : or 4.12  95% ci 2.66.6  p < 0.01 ; 20% in planned hospital birth : or 4.29  95% ci 2.57.4  p < 0.01 ) . however  if classified into nulliparous and parous women  there were no significant differences in the rate of transfers among the 3 groups  as shown in table 1 . 
 in addition  among the 3 groups there were no significant differences in the rate of the main 2 indications for transfer : fetal heart rate abnormality and failure to progress . 
 the main indications for transfer after delivery were maternal postpartum hemorrhage and neonatal respiratory distress associated with asphyxia . 
 table 3 shows the obstetric and neonatal outcomes in the pregnant women initially considered as  low - risk  for receiving our midwife - led primary delivery care systems . there were no significant differences in these outcomes among the 3 groups 
 our obstetric care system involves the division of women in labor into low- and high - risk groups [ 912 ] . 
 the women who are initially considered low - risk can choose freely between midwife - led care and obstetric shared care . if complications occur or risk factors arise during labor in the primary midwife - led care  they are transferred to obstetric shared care . 
 this may be the first report concerning the differences in the timing of transfers from midwife - led care to obstetric shared care among the 3 systems of midwife - led primary delivery care in japan . in this study 
  there was no evidence that the primary midwife - led care is unsafe for  low - risk  pregnant women in any of these 3 midwife - led delivery care systems . 
 however  there were no significant differences in the timing of referrals from midwife - led care to obstetric shared care between the system led by midwives who belong to our hospital ( hospital midwifery system ) and the systems led by the midwives who do not belong to our hospital . in the hospital midwifery system 
  the timing of transfers seemed to be the earliest due to the ease of transfer within the same hospital and administrator setting . on the other hand  
 the rate of transfers after delivery with the other 2 systems was higher than that in the hospital midwifery care . during the period  the main indications for transfers were maternal postpartum hemorrhage and/or neonatal respiratory distress associated with asphyxia . 
 fortunately  the difference was not associated with adverse obstetric or neonatal outcomes ; however  unfortunately  they led to early mother - to - child separation  especially in cases of planned home birth because healthy puerperal women or newborns can not be transferred from home to hospital according to japanese law . 
 although home birth might be very comfortable  those involved must be prepared for mother - to - child separation in cases of referrals after delivery . 
 the major limitations of this study were the small sample size and lack of long - term follow - up of mothers and children to consider the potential of the findings based on our own context . 
 there were no cases of fetal / neonatal death under the midwife - led delivery care . 
 the most evaluated outcome under midwife - led delivery was the satisfaction of pregnant women with the development of mother - child relationships after delivery . 
 in addition  there might be some bias related to the backgrounds in the selection of the systems because this was not a randomized trial study . 
 therefore  a further large prospective study with long - term follow - up may be needed . 
 there were no significant differences in perinatal outcomes among the 3 systems ; however  there were some differences in the status of the transfers to the obstetric shared care ."," :

1) Abstract: This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of labor using three different systems of Japanese midwife-led primary delivery care. Results showed no significant differences in outcomes, but there were variations in transfer patterns among the groups.

2) Research and Discussion: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to compare three systems of delivering care by midwives in Japan. While there were no major differences in outcomes, the rate and timing of transfers were slightly higher in the system with midwives belonging to the hospital.

3) Results and Conclusion: The study found no significant differences in perinatal outcomes among the three systems, but there were variations in transfer patterns, with the highest rate and earliest timing in the system with midwives from the hospital. These findings suggest a need for further research on the impact of different midwife-led care models on perinatal outcomes."
"diabetes decreases the overall life expectancy and cause a heavy burden on public health ( 1 ) . 
 moreover  the asia - pacific region is considered to be on the verge of an emerging diabetes epidemic ( 2 ) . 
 the development of type 2 diabetes is affected by genetic and environmental determinants ( 3 ) . 
 recently  one study investigated whether common variants of functional and positional candidate genes  including adrb3  pparg  enpp1 and capn10  were determinants of type 2 diabetes ( 4 ) . 
 enpp1  also called k121q  has a glutamine substitution for lysine at codon 121 ( 5 ) . 
 type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance ( 6 )  and enpp1 plays an important role in insulin resistance ( 7  8) . 
 enpp1 interacts with -subunit of the insulin receptor to interrupt signaling ( 9 ) . in previous studies  the k121q polymorphism of the human pc-1 gene was strongly associated with insulin resistance ( 1  3  7  10 - 12 ) . however  there was no association between insulin resistance and the k121q variant ( 13  14 ) . 
 in addition  there were discrepancies for the impact of enpp1 polymorphism on obesity between ethnic groups ( 5  10  13  15 - 19 ) . 
 obesity increases the concentration of insulin in plasma and is the major contributor of insulin resistance ( 20 ) . 
 obesity appears to be an effect modifier of type 2 diabetes in d1057 carriers ( 21 ) . 
 the association of obesity with the genetic variant of the insulin receptor substrate was identified in other studies ( 21  22 ) . in the chinese han population  
 the pc-1 q121 allele was associated with insulin resistance . in women  carriers of the q allele 
 had an increased risk for obesity development ( 3 ) . in caucasians and african - americans  121q carriers had an association with increased body mass index ( bmi ) ( 23 )  and the three - allele risk type haploid qdeltg with the q allele increased the risk for obesity ( 24 ) 
 however  in the danish population  there were no differences in the distribution of frequencies of dominant types ( kk wild type and kq / qq variant type ) and alleles ( 19 ) . 
 the complexity of type 2 diabetes is related to factors such as genetic heterogeneity  interactions between genes  and the modulating role played by the environment ( 4 ) . in spite of these limitations  studies of type 2 diabetes and genetic factors of obesity 
 can predict the risks for development of both type 2 diabetes and obesity in order to assist primary prevention  and korea is an appropriate country for such studies because of the homogeneity of racial composition and lifestyle ( 25 ) . 
 therefore  the aim of this study was to analyze the presence of the enpp1 polymorphism  not studied yet in korean population  to identify the association between genotypes and allele with type 2 diabetes and obesity .

 there were 195 male workers ( age 48.26.7 yr  bmi 24.672.64 kg / m ) who were diagnosed as diabetics during medical examinations conducted from march 2004 to october . 
 the 1750 male workers ( age 45.27.7 yr  bmi 24.772.64 kg / m ) in the control group were selected randomly . 
 subjects were included if they met one of the criteria below and their onset age was older than 20 yr old to exclude type 1 diabetes : 1 ) blood - sugar level before a meal exceeded 126 mg / dl twice or more ; 2 ) blood - sugar level before a meal exceeded 126 mg / dl once or more and blood - sugar level two hours after a meal exceeded 200 mg / dl ; 3 ) those who reported that he had a history of diabetes in the questionnaire and being taken oral hypoglycemic agents . 
 the workers included in the obesity group were those whose bmi was 25 kg / m or more . after collecting a blood sample from vein in fasting ( 8 hr ) status  we measured the blood - sugar level  insulin  and lipid profile 
 . we also measured height and weight to calculate bmi . if fasting glucose levels were greater than 126 mg / dl 
  we checked the 2 hr post - prandial plasma glucose level at each site within 1 month . 
 height and weight were measured by autoanalyzer ( health guard  fanics  seoul  korea ) . 
 the fasting blood level was analyzed by glucose - oxidase assay using an autochemistry analyzer . to determine the lipid profile  
 total cholesterol was analyzed by enzyme assay using cholesterol oxidase ( cod )  high density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol by glycerol phosphate oxidase assay  low density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol by direct surfactant assay . 
 we carried out this study under the approval by the ethnics committee of the asan medical center  and obtained written consent from all subjects  providing subjects with sufficient explanation to obtain informed consent . 
 we extracted genomic dna from buffy coats using the generall blood sv kit ( general biosystem  seoul  korea ) and following the instructions suggested by the manufacturer . 
 the method of genotyping used to identify the k121q polymorphism in enpp1 exon 4 was polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism ( pcr - rflp )  using dna treated with a restriction enzyme after pcr  based on the paper reported by abate et al . 
 we carried out student 's t - test to analyze the effects of genotypes on biochemical parameters using genotypes as factors . 
 the hardy - weinberg equilibrium was computed based on the  goodness - of - fit test . 
 we also investigated the differences in frequencies of genotypes between type 2 diabetic and normal groups  and between obesity and normal groups by fisher 's exact test . 
 the spss 12.0 ( for window ) statistical software package was used for statistical analysis .

 the hardy - weinberg equilibrium was computed based on the  goodness - of - fit test . 
 we also investigated the differences in frequencies of genotypes between type 2 diabetic and normal groups  and between obesity and normal groups by fisher 's exact test . 
 the spss 12.0 ( for window ) statistical software package was used for statistical analysis . 
 the frequencies of the kk type  kq type  and qq type in enpp1 k121q were 82.1%  17% and 0.9%  respectively . 
 the homozygous type of q carrier ( qq type ) was added to the heterozygous type ( kq type ) because the frequency of qq type was very low ( 0.9% ) . 
 we investigated the differences in age  blood pressure  bmi  and results of clinical examinations according to genotypes of enpp1 k121q between the type 2 diabetic and non - diabetic groups ( table 1 ) . when type 2 diabetics and non - diabetics were pooled ( n=1945 )  there were no significant differences in bmi  systolic pressure  diastolic pressure  glucose value in fasting status  total cholesterol  ldl cholesterol  hdl cholesterol  triglyceride  c - reactive protein  and homa - ir between the kk type and kq+qq type . 
 in addition  there were no significant differences in the same characteristics above between type 2 diabetic group and non - diabetic groups ( table1 )  and between the obese group and non - obese groups ( table2 ) . 
 the frequencies of genotypes were in accordance with the hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( p=0.85 ) . 
 the odds ratio of having a kq+qq genotype was 0.85 for diabetics versus non - diabetics . 
 the odds ratio of having a q allele was 0.91 for diabetics versus non - diabetics . 
 however  there was no significant difference in the genotypic and allelic distribution between type 2 diabetics and non - diabetics ( table3 ) . 
 the odds of a kq+qq genotype were 0.93 for obese versus non - obese subjects . furthermore  the odds of having a q allele were 0.96 for obese versus non - obese subjects 
 . however  there was no significant difference in the genotypic and allelic distribution between obese and non - obese ( table4 ) . 
 the frequency of the kk type in enpp1 k121q genotypes was 82.1%  that of kq+qq type was 17.9% and that of q allele was 9.4% . 
 there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution among these genotypes and alleles ( p=0.81  p=0.89  respectively )  although the 121q carrier and q allele in obese and/or diabetics seemed to differ slightly from those in the non - obese non - diabetics ( reference group ) . in determining the prevalence of the q allele carriers ( kq and qq subjects ) and q allele 
  there were no significant differences in the genotypic and allelic distribution with the respect to any phenotypes ( data not shown ) . 
 after adjusting for the effects of obesity  the probability of type 2 diabetes in kq+qq type was 0.858 ( data not shown ) and that in q allele was 1.095  showing no significant difference ( table 5 ) . 
 moreover  after adjusting for the effects of type 2 diabetes  the probability of developing obesity in the kq+qq type was 0.936 ( data not shown ) and that in the q allele was 1.038  showing no significant difference ( table 6 ) . 
 the results of studies of the association between enpp1 k121q variants and both type 2 diabetes and obesity in several races are disparate . 
 we carried out this study to investigate the association of k121q variants with type 2 diabetes and obesity in korean male workers . 
 insulin resistance is a major component of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes ( 27 )  and insulin receptor kinase activity is impaired in muscle and other insulin - sensitive tissue of many type 2 diabetic patients ( 28 )  and then a potential inhibitor of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase is identified as the plasma - cell membrane differentiation antigen-1 ( pc-1 ) ( 29 ) . 
 therefore  it is significant to analyze enpp1 ( pc-1 ) polymorphism . in the previous studies of the association between type 2 diabetes and polymorphism in enpp1  the k121q missense mutation increased the odds ratio ( or ) for type 2 diabetes in dominican ( 10 )  south asian  caucasian ( 16 )  finnish ( 18 )  and french populations ( 24 ) . 
 moreover  according to a meta - analysis of the association between enpp1 k121q variant and type 2 diabetes  the odds ratios were 1.30 ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ]  1.13 - 1.50 ) ( 16 ) and 1.17 ( 95% ci  1.10 - 1.25 ) ( 19 )  showing significant association . in this study  121q was not associated with type 2 diabetes  showing consistent results with those in the japanese population ( 5 )  danish caucasians ( 13 )  oji - cree population ( 17 )  finnish population ( 18 )  and danish white subjects ( 19 ) . 
 most type 2 diabetes in koreans is characterized by non - obesity  thus the enpp1 k121q mutant relevant to insulin resistance possibly could be a candidate gene that is not appropriate to explain susceptibility to type 2 diabetes . 
 this can be a possible explanation for the lack of association between enpp1 121q carrier and type 2 diabetes in this study . 
 obesity is a main risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes ( 20 ) and there is linear association between obesity and type 2 diabetes ( 3 ) . in previous studies of the association between obesity and polymorphism in enpp1  
 121q carriers and/or q allele were associated with obesity in the chinese han population ( bmi of obesity group 27 kg / m ) ( 3 )  caucasians ( bmi of obesity group > 90th percentile )  african - american adults ( bmi of obesity group > 80th percentile ) ( 23 )  french population ( bmi of obesity group 95th percentile ) ( 24 )  and dominican population ( bmi of obesity group 30 kg / m ) ( 10 ) . however  in this study ( bmi of obesity group 25 kg / m )  there was no difference in distribution between obesity and 121q carriers and presence of the q allele . 
 this result was consistent with those from a study of 7333 danes ( 19 ) and a spanish population ( 14 ) in which the bmi of the obesity group was 25 kg / m or higher . on the other hand  in matsuoka 's study  
 the percentage of subjects whose bmi was 30 kg / m or higher was too low ( 2.5% ) to investigate the effect of k121q genotype on obesity . 
 the results of the present study showed that the frequencies of the q allele was 8.7% in the type 2 diabetic group and 9.2% in the obesity group  which was lower than those in finnish and swedish populations ( 12.9 - 15.1% ) ( 11 )  danish caucasians ( 14 - 16% ) ( 13 )  south asians in chennai ( 14% )  caucasians in dallas ( 16% )  south asians in dallas ( 19% ) ( 16 )  the dominican population ( 54.2% ) ( 10 ) and  black children ( 77% ) ( 30 ) . 
 the frequencies of the q allele investigated in this study might have a smaller statistical power to explain any association with either type 2 diabetes or obesity with 121q carriers ( kq+qq ) and/or the q allele . in conclusion 
  the present study suggests that the enpp1 k121q polymorphism was not associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity . 
 the results of negative associations in this study might be attributable to the low prevalence of obesity  relatively younger age  and low frequencies of the 121q carriers . 
 large and prospective studies are needed to confirm this preliminary observation in the korean population .","

1) Abstract: The enpp1 k121q polymorphism was investigated in relation to type 2 diabetes and obesity in Korean male workers. The results showed no significant association between the enpp1 121q genotype and either condition.
2) Research and Discussion: A case-control study was conducted on 1,945 male workers, with 195 having type 2 diabetes and 1,750 being non-diabetic. Biochemical factors and BMI were assessed. The enpp1 121q allele was not found to be a determining factor for either diabetes or obesity.
3) Results and Conclusion: Analysis showed no significant association between the enpp1 121q genotype and type 2 diabetes or obesity in Korean males. This differs from results in other populations, possibly due to genetic differences. Overall, the enpp1 121q allele was not a critical determinant for diabetes or obesity in this study."
"lipid apheresis provides a safe and effective means of treating patients with severe hyperlipidemia . it 
 functions by first separating plasma from blood cells with a cell separator and then using either the adsorption of apolipoprotein b by affinity columns containing anti - apolipoprotein b antibodies or dextran sulphate  or their precipitation at low ph by heparin . 
 lipid apheresis allows patients to attain lower levels of low - density lipoprotein ( ldl )  which are usually not attainable with traditional drug therapy alone  while leaving high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) levels generally unaffected . when used in conjunction with statins and other lipid - lowering drugs 
  lipid apheresis may also induce the regression of coronary atherosclerotic plaque in familial hypercholesterolemia ( fh ) patients . 
 fh is a group of autosomal dominant genetic defects resulting in elevated serum ( ldl ) cholesterol levels . in the heterozygous state  
 fh is a relatively common but serious genetic disorder  with an incidence of about 1 in 500 persons in the general population . 
 fh has been associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis  premature coronary heart disease  and heart failure [ 3  4 ] . 
 fh is caused by a mutation affecting apolipoprotein b  proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 ( pcsk9 ; an enzyme involved in ldl receptor degradation )  or  most commonly  the ldl receptor gene  resulting in defective ldl receptors and/or a diminished number of ldl receptors [ 7  8 ] . 
 these mutations cause ldl to be catabolized at a slower rate and thus accumulate in the circulation . 
 currently  fh is treated using a variety of cholesterol - lowering drugs  most notably statins or hmg - coa reductase inhibitors . for many patients  however  statins are not a viable treatment option  because of either intolerance or ineffectiveness . 
 lipid apheresis is an alternative form of treatment for these fh patients as well as those who have persistently elevated ldl levels despite treatment . 
 because apheresis is performed at only a few highly specialized centers in relatively low volume  there is very little literature discussing the effectiveness of lipid apheresis on the reduction of lipid profiles and the prevention of future cardiac events . 
 this study  therefore  reports the experience in a single metropolitan center of treating patients with hyperlipidemia with lipid apheresis . 
 retrospective chart reviews were performed and questionnaire surveys were given to active lipid apheresis patients at the minneapolis heart institute ( mhi ) at abbott northwestern hospital ( anw )  minneapolis  minnesota . 
 mhi and anw are divisions of allina health  a large healthcare provider in minnesota and western wisconsin . 
 patients were identified through an electronic health record ( ehr ) screen of ambulatory patients representing all patients seen at all allina health metro area and regional locations between 2009 and 2012 ( epic systems  verona wi ) . of these patients  
 criteria to qualify for apheresis were based on the united states food and drug administration ( fda ) approval recommendations . 
 currently  the fda supports ldl apheresis for patients who  after six months  do not have an adequate response to diet therapy and maximum drug therapy  due to either ineffectiveness or intolerance  and meet the following criteria : functional homozygotes with an ldl cholesterol > 500  mg / dl without cad  functional heterozygotes with ldl cholesterol > 300  mg / dl without cad  functional heterozygotes with ldl cholesterol > 200  mg / dl with documented coronary heart disease . 
 functional homozygotes with an ldl cholesterol > 500  mg / dl without cad  functional heterozygotes with ldl cholesterol > 300  mg / dl without cad  functional heterozygotes with ldl cholesterol > 200  mg / dl with documented coronary heart disease . 
 the date of birth  gender  date of apheresis initiation  lipid disorder diagnosis  apheresis frequency  and family history of cardiac events were recorded . 
 patients were noted as having fh if the active problem list contained a diagnosis of fh . to determine which patients had fh  we used the national lipid association ( nla ) criteria for an 80% probable fh diagnosis  using the highest ldl recorded in the patient chart as follows : age < 20 and ldl > 190  mg / dl  age 2029 and ldl > 220  mg / dl  and age 30 and ldl > 250  mg / dl . 
 potential homozygous fh ( hofh ) patients were defined as having an untreated ldl > 500  mg / dl or a treated ( on statin ) ldl over > 300  mg / dl  in addition to clinical evidence of xanthomas before age of 10 years or having two parents with heart disease or high lipids . 
 identifiable secondary causes for marked hyperlipidemia were excluded from the analysis by examining the ehr chart of each potential homozygote . 
 current cholesterol lowering medications were also recorded  focusing on the use of statins  colesevelam ( welchol )  ezetimibe ( zetia )  niacin  and aspirin . 
 a significant cardiovascular event was defined as a myocardial infarction ( mi )  a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( ptca ) or stenting procedure  or a coronary artery bypass graft ( cabg ) using ehr documented icd-9 criteria . cardiac events were separated by their occurrence before or after the patient began apheresis  and the total number of events was recorded for each group . 
 multiple cardiac events occurring at the same hospitalization  such as mi followed by ptca  were counted as a single event for cardiac event rate calculation . 
 pre- and postapheresis cardiac event rates were calculated by adding the total number of cardiac events and dividing by the total person years during each time period . 
 the preapheresis time period describes the time from the first documented ehr visit to the date of apheresis initiation . 
 the postapheresis time period describes the time from the date of apheresis initiation to the study date . 
 unverifiable events noted in the ehr but occurring prior to the first documented ehr visit were noted but excluded from the cardiac event rate calculation . 
 mean acute ldl reductions were calculated by averaging all recorded ldl values prior to and immediately after the treatment sessions . 
 mean acute total cholesterol  hdl cholesterol  and triglyceride reductions were calculated by using lipid profile from the most recent treatment session . 
 ldl apheresis was performed at abbott northwestern hospital using the kaneka liposorber la-15 system ( kaneka medical products ) . 
 the system consists of the kaneka ma-03 machine  the integrated sulflux kp-05 plasma separator  which consists of porous hollow fibers  to separate the plasma from the whole blood  and two disposable liposorber la-15 adsorption columns to adsorb apolipoprotein b - containing lipoproteins from patient plasma . 
 patients confirmed information in their ehr such as risk factors  answered questions relating to their awareness of fh and if their family had been previously tested for it  provided their level of satisfaction with their apheresis program  and indicated their interest in learning more about alternative treatments . 
 the data from the questionnaires was cross - referenced with the data from the patient charts to ensure accuracy . 
 descriptive statistics are displayed as means and sds for continuous variables ; number and percentage with characteristic are given for categorical variables . 
 categorical variables were analyzed using pearson 's chi - square or fisher 's exact tests . 
 continuous variables were analyzed using student 's t - test . a value of p < 0.05 was considered significant  and p values are two - sided where possible . 
 all statistical calculations and plots were done with stata 11.2 ( college station  tx ) . 
 institutional review board approval was obtained for data collection  follow - up  and data analysis . 
 of these  8 ( 72.7% ) were male  10 ( 90.9% ) were caucasian  1 ( 9.1% ) was african american  10 ( 90.9% ) carried the diagnosis of fh  with 2 ( 18.2% ) patients identified as probable homozygotes  and 1 ( 9.1% ) was diagnosed as having familial combined hyperlipidemia . 
 the average age of patients was 65.6    9.3 years  and patients had been on apheresis for an average of 6.2    7.0 years . 
 four ( 36.4% ) patients were currently on statins while the other 7 ( 63.6% ) had a history of statin intolerance . 
 five of 11 ( 45.5% ) patients were on a nonstatin cholesterol lowering medications  including 1 ( 9.1% ) on colesevelam ( welchol )  3 ( 27.3% ) on ezetimibe ( zetia )  and 1 ( 9.1% ) on niacin . 
 maximum ldl levels ranged from 211 to 448  mg / dl with a mean ( sd ) value of 298    80.7  mg / dl in the study group . since our ehr was implemented in 2005  it is possible we may be underestimating the highest lifetime ldl for each patient . 
 of the 11 participants  9 completed the questionnaire in its entirety ; 1 patient provided answers to all questions but did not disclose risk factors and 1 patient did not complete the questionnaire . 
 all of the patients indicated that they were aware that they likely had fh and 7 patients indicated that their immediate family had been tested for fh . 
 the patients self - reported a total of 44 cardiac events before apheresis and 8 cardiac events after apheresis . 
 of the 10 patients that completed the questionnaire  4 patients were currently on statins while the other 6 were statin intolerant . 
 eight patients ( 72.7% ) had a cardiac event documented by ehr  with 43 cardiac events occurring overall ( table 4 ) . 
 self - reported events which were unable to be verified via the ehr were excluded from the cardiac event rate analysis . 
 thirty - four cardiac events were documented before apheresis in 8 patients compared with 9 events in 5 patients after apheresis . after excluding cardiac events that were unverifiable  
 14 cardiac events were documented in the preapheresis time period and 7 were documented in the postapheresis time period . 
 the cardiac event rates were calculated to be 0.23 ( 0.13  0.39 ) events per person year in the preapheresis group and 0.10 ( 0.041  0.21 ) events per person year in the postapheresis group ( p = 0.064 ) . 
 patients were observed for an average of 7.6    5.9 years before apheresis and 6.2    4.7 years after apheresis  with 60.6 total patient years before apheresis and 67.8 patient years after apheresis . 
 this study was conducted to gain more information on lipid apheresis and evaluate the effectiveness in lowering lipid values . in addition 
  through chart review and patient survey  we attempted to gain a greater understanding of this patient population in terms of traditional risk factors  family awareness and screening  statin and other cholesterol medication uses  desire for additional treatment options  and ultimately cardiac events . 
 our study shows that apheresis markedly lowers total cholesterol  ldl cholesterol  triglycerides and  to a much lesser degree  hdl cholesterol . 
 there was a small  but statistically significant  reduction in hdl values after apheresis . 
 many of these patients were  statin intolerant  and some had been using nonstatin cholesterol medications . 
 importantly  10/11 ( 90.9% ) participants indicated a desire to learn more about other potential treatment options  indicating that this population may indeed experience fatigue of this procedure . 
 although taken from a small study population  our data suggests a reduction in cardiac event rate after apheresis . while not statistically significant  our data shows a strong trend towards event rate reduction . 
 this statistical insignificance is likely explained by the study 's small sample size . with a larger population 
 it is also important to note that the risk for cardiac events increases with age . 
 ldl apheresis has been shown to improve endothelium dependent vasodilation [ 11  12 ]  microvascular flow  and myocardial perfusion . 
 some studies [ 2  15  16 ] have also shown a significant reduction in angiographic cad  but others have not . 
 these studies have been small  primarily nonrandomized trials . the ldl - apheresis atherosclerosis regression study ( laars ) 
 looked at the change in plaque characteristics of patients undergoing apheresis compared to drug therapy over a period of two years . 
 in that period  7 out of 21 patients on apheresis had a cardiac event compared with 3 out of 21 on medication only . while this study found that apheresis arrested the progression of atherosclerosis 
 the fh regression study found that ldl apheresis combined with simvastatin was more effective than colestipol plus simvastatin in reducing ldl cholesterol and lipoprotein ( a ) but was less effective at influencing coronary atherosclerosis . 
 another study   found that  out of 18 patients  3 had myocardial infarctions  1 underwent a cabg  and 12 needed coronary angioplasties within two years of beginning a combination therapy of apheresis  statins  and probucol . before beginning the combination therapy  11 had experienced a mi  5 had undergone a cabg  and 13 had undergone an angioplasty . 
 the heparin - induced extracorporeal ldl precipitation ( help ) study   found that help is suitable for reducing ldl concentrations and may work to reduce the burden of atherosclerosis  as there were no myocardial infarctions and a low coronary intervention rate in patients who began apheresis . 
 due to the expensive nature of apheresis  a randomized  controlled clinical trial is needed to truly gauge the effectiveness of apheresis in reducing the occurrence of cardiac events . 
 if apheresis is not deemed effective or is minimally effective  as some of these studies suggest  other types of treatment  such as lomitapide  mipomersen  or pcsk9 inhibitors  should be pursued . while satisfaction was generally high in our survey  
 patients specifically cited that this satisfaction was based on the results of apheresis and not on the process itself . 
 many patients complained about the invasive nature of apheresis  citing bruises from the procedure and the inconvenience of reporting for treatment every two weeks . 
 additionally  almost all patients were interested in learning more about alternative treatments  suggesting that they would prefer an alternative treatment which could match the results provided by apheresis . 
 this study had several limitations . since lipid apheresis is an advanced treatment for an uncommon genetic disease  the limited number of patients available to participate in the study led to a small sample size . 
 the event rate reduction was not statistically significant but showed a strong trend toward cardiac event rate reduction before and after apheresis . by defining the observational period initial time point as the first documented ehr visit 
  we excluded 20 events before apheresis and 2 events after apheresis from the cardiac event rate calculation . 
 the lipid - lowering effects of apheresis are best expressed as reductions in interval means . 
 although lipid apheresis was performed every two weeks  ldl values were not measured ever two weeks due to clinical practices . 
 this inconsistency in measurement intervals prevents the use of more advanced measures to accurately track the effect apheresis has on ldl measurements . 
 finally  this study focused on active apheresis patients and therefore did not include patients who had stopped apheresis or were deceased . 
 lipid apheresis can reliably reduce ldl  non - hdl cholesterol  triglyceride  and total cholesterol levels in fh patients . 
 our data suggest that lipid apheresis shows a strong  but not statistically significant  trend towards the reduction of cardiac events . 
 apheresis is a viable treatment for fh patients  especially those that are statin - intolerant  due to its lipid lowering nature and its apparent reduction of cardiac events . 
 however  there is a need for alternative treatments which are less invasive and provide easier patient access .","


Abstract:
This study examines the effect of apheresis on the lipid panel and cardiac event rates in patients with severe hyperlipidemia. Results show significant reductions in lipid levels and a potential decrease in recurrence of cardiac events. Patient interest in alternative treatment options suggests the need for further research.

Research and Discussion:
An electronic health record screen identified 11 patients undergoing lipid apheresis, with 10/11 carrying a diagnosis of fh. Baseline demographics, lipid levels, and cardiac events were recorded, along with patient-reported risk factors and interest in alternative treatment. Results demonstrate a marked reduction in LDL-C levels and suggest a potential decrease in cardiac event recurrence.

Results and Conclusion:
Significant reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and non-HDL values were observed after apheresis. A total of 34 cardiac events were reported before apheresis, compared to 9 events after treatment. A high prevalence of statin intolerance and interest in alternative treatment options was noted. These findings suggest the need for further research comparing apheresis to newer treatment modalities."
"agenesis of the inferior vena cava ( ivc ) as a cause of recurrent deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) is uncommon . 
 a 33-year - old male with no family history of thrombophilia  who had experienced multiple recurrent episodes of dvt over a 15-year period of unknown cause  was admitted into our hospital because of cellulitis in the right leg . 
 congenital absence of the ivc could be a rare risk factor for idiopathic dvt  especially in young individuals . 
 venous thromboembolism ( vte )  which includes deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) and pulmonary embolism  has an incidence of 1 to 3 per 1000 individuals per year in western populations.1 congenital anomalies of the inferior vena cava ( ivc ) are uncommon  and have been associated with the development of venous thrombosis of the lower limbs.2 congenital anomalies of the ivc has been reported as a risk factor for dvt  especially in individuals < 30 years old  and a concomitant thrombophilic disorder has been found in such individuals.3 we report a case of recurrent dvt in a 33-year - old man with agenesis of the ivc . 
 the patient had experienced recurring episodes of idiopathic dvt in the right leg for 15 years . 
 a 33-year - old man was admitted to the internal medicine department  holy family hospital  nazareth  israel  because of cellulitis in the right leg . 
 one week prior to his admission  he complained about pain and increased local heat in the left ankle and thumb of the right leg . 
 the patient had no history of previous trauma  surgery  insect bites  dysuria  or joint symptoms  and no family history of thrombophilia . 
 he reported that he had ( a ) rheumatic fever without any complications when he was 19 years old  which was treated with penicillin  ( b ) been hospitalized when he was 23 years old because of infected skin ulcers on the right calf  for which he was treated by parenteral antibiotics  and ( c ) recurrent episodes of idiopathic dvt for the last 15 years . 
 he also reported that he had not been treated with warfarin  but he had been on prophylactic enoxaparin therapy for dvt some years ago which has since been stopped and that he had been recently treated with allopurinol and colchicine for a presumed diagnosis of gout . 
 he had been investigated several times for a primary hypercoagulability state  and the results were negative . on examination  the most outstanding clinical findings were swelling of ankles  mild edema  redness  and increased temperature of the right ankle and calf with trophic skin changes ( skin discoloration with ulcers )  and superficial varicose veins in the lower abdomen ( figure 1 ) . 
 the clinical laboratory findings ( erythrocyte sedimentation rate  leukocyte and platelet counts  and plasma hemoglobulin  plasma protein c  plasma protein s  fibrinogen  and antithrombin iii levels )  the results of the kidney and liver function tests  and resistance to activated protein c were all normal . 
 polymorphisms of the genes that encode for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase were not detected  and the factor v leiden and prothrombin mutations g20210a were absent . the results of the clinical immunological studies for complement c3 and c4 and rheumatoid factor were negative  and no circulating titers for antinuclear antibody  antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody  and cardiolipin antibody were found . 
 cultures from the infected skin ulcers of the right leg were positive for methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) . 
 ultrasound imaging of the leg veins showed a previous dvt in the right common femoral vein  and dilated superficial inguinal veins . 
 computer tomography with contrast of the abdomen showed agenesis of the infrarenal segment of the ivc ( figure 2 ) with dilated azygos and hemiazygos veins ( figure 3 ) . 
 there were also varicose veins in the abdominal wall and right groin  which were associated with dilated superficial and collateral veins ( figure 4 ) . 
 transthoracic echocardiography of the patient s heart revealed mild atrial enlargement and good systolic function of the left ventricle  and no pathological valvular flows . 
 the patient was diagnosed as having agenesis of the infrarenal segment of the ivc and dvt of the right leg without concomitant risk factors for vte . 
 since we attributed the agenesis of the ivc to be the underlying cause of the recurrent episodes of the dvts  the patient was started on anticoagulant therapy ( subcutaneous enoxaparin 160 mg / day ) for dvt  antibiotic therapy ( intravenous vancomycin 1.5 g / day for mrsa skin infection )  and referred to a vascular surgeon specialist but the patient refused . at follow - up in the internal medicine clinic  
 the most outstanding clinical findings were swelling of left ankle  redness  with trophic skin changes  and a mild improvement of the skin ulcers . despite several phone calls for follow - up 
 the normal ivc is composed of 4 segments : hepatic  suprarenal  renal  and infrarenal . since many transformations can occur during the formation of the ivc 
 such anomalies occur in 0.3% of otherwise healthy individuals  and in 0.6% to 2% of patients with other cardiovascular anomalies.4 ruggeri et al reported 10 years ago 4 cases of congenital absence of the ivc in 75 young patients with idiopathic dvt over a 5-year period  and estimated that 5% of young patients with dvt had an anomaly of the ivc.5 venous thrombosis is caused by the presence of isolated or combined risk factors . 
 almost 150 years ago  the nineteenth century pathologist rudolf virchow described 3 critically important causes of venous thrombosis : venous damage  coagulation defect(s )  and venous stasis.6 individuals with a congenital anomaly of the ivc are typically asymptomatic  and the anomaly is usually detected incidentally during radiological or abdominal procedures 
 . congenital absence of the ivc is infrequently associated with thromboembolic events.5 patients who suffer from congenital anomalies of the ivc usually develop a compensatory circulation through the azygos veins or collateral abdominal veins in order to keep the venous return near normal levels.7 most reported cases of congenital anomalies of ivc cases have been linked to thrombophilia disorders.357 however  the true prevalence of thrombophilia in congenital anomalies of the ivc is unknown because the screening for thrombophilia in patients with an ivc anomaly was usually incomplete.3 anticoagulants  but not thrombolytic therapy  are usually prescribed for venous thrombosis  but the duration of the anticoagulant therapy is not well established . 
 hence  anticoagulant therapy for an indefinite duration will probably be prescribed  unless vascular reconstructive surgery is done on the anomalous ivc . 
 such surgery has been rarely reported  and its long - term outcome is undetermined.8 congenital anomalies of the ivc may cause recurrent dvt  especially in young individuals .","

Abstract: Recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with unknown cause is not uncommon in young adults. Congenital absence of the inferior vena cava (IVC) may be a rare risk factor for idiopathic DVT. A 33-year-old male with no family history of thrombophilia presented with cellulitis and was found to have agenesis of the IVC. 

Research and Discussion: Agenesis of the IVC as a cause of recurrent DVT has been reported in literature, with the majority of cases being discovered incidentally. The absence of the IVC can lead to abnormal venous drainage and stasis, increasing the risk of DVT. Further research is needed to understand the exact mechanism of this association.

Results and Conclusion: In this case, the absence of the IVC was likely the underlying cause of the patient's recurrent DVT. This highlights the importance of considering congenital abnormalities in evaluating young individuals with idiopathic DVT. Awareness of this rare association can aid in prompt diagnosis and appropriate management."
"an exponential rise in alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) prevalence rates is predicted to parallel the aging of baby boomers creating a potentially unsustainable economic burden to the healthcare system .   delaying the onset or progression of ad  even modestly  by earlier pharmacological intervention could substantially reduce the economic and psychosocial impact of the illness [ 1  2 ] .   unfortunately 
  many ad patients remain undiagnosed or go undetected until the later stages of disease . 
 insights into the underlying pathological mechanisms involving beta - amyloid plaque deposition within the brain have   led to the development of a host of antiamyloid agents   that are in various stages of clinical investigation . 
 there is now a scientific consensus that the pathological events in ad initiate decades before clinical symptoms become apparent  and if disease modification is realized in the coming decades  the need for improved methods of early detection prior to the overt clinical signs will be accentuated .   traditionally  neuropsychological measures  particularly those that tap cognitive abilities subsumed by the hippocampal formation such as episodic memory  have shown usefulness in identifying cognitively normal elders who subsequently develop ad [ 4  5 ] . 
 decrements in semantic memory and concept formation have been shown to occur nearly a decade before the development of ad . 
 performance on visual - spatial and verbal memory measures in midlife have also been shown to predict later memory loss . 
 however  individuals with very high premorbid intellectual abilities experiencing incipient cognitive decline may go undetected  and false positives are possible in individuals with a low level of intellectual abilities . also appropriate 
 interpretation of extensive neuropsychological testing requires a high degree of expertise and training  which limits its use in routine clinical settings .   the advancement of molecular imaging tracers that bind to amyloid  such as pittsburgh compound b ( pib ) or longer - lived probes ( e.g.  fddnp )  offers a non - invasive in vivo method to detect and quantify brain amyloid deposition [ 8  9 ] .   however  this approach for presymptomatic detection is economically impractical for routine use given the current costs and restrictions on  medically necessary  use . 
 similarly  biomarkers including a142 and phosphorylated tau ( also implicated in ad pathology ) in cerebral spinal fluid ( csf ) can predict subsequent cognitive decline [ 10  11 ]  but lumbar puncture carries risks and is inconvenient for wide - scale use in cognitively impaired elderly subjects . 
 blood - based biomarkers have more practical applicability for routine use and are likely to be more cost effective than both csf and imaging procedures .   consequently  measurement of a140 and a142 in blood is increasingly being explored and shows potential in identifying individuals at the preclinical stage of ad [ 1214 ] . 
 it has been reported that csf a levels are subject to high diurnal fluctuations with extremely high variability reported over 12 hours .   over days and weeks  
 furthermore  serum contains more a than plasma  possibly due to the release of bound a during the clotting process . 
 hence  serum a appears suitable for use in predicting mci / ad and optimal sensitivity  and specificity is probably achievable if combined with current diagnostic procedures  such as brief neuropsychological testing .    in this study 
  we examined the usefulness of brief neuropsychological tests in combination with blood a140 and a142 as a predictive test for detecting mci / ad in at - risk older adults at a pre - symptomatic stage . 
 such an approach will be more practical for clinical use and be germane in designing large - scale prevention trials . 
 participants included a subset of subjects enrolled in the alzheimer 's disease anti - inflammatory prevention trial ( adapt ) . 
 adapt was a randomized  placebo - controlled  multicenter primary prevention trial sponsored by the national institute on aging . 
 subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups : celecoxib ( 200  mg b.i.d . )  naproxen sodium ( 220  mg b.i.d . )  or placebo . 
 full details of data collection  measurements  and study procedures are available at http://www.jhucct.com/adapt/manall43.pdf and described elsewhere . the inclusion criteria for adapt subjects were age of 70 or older at enrollment  a self - reported family history of ad - like dementia  and normal cognitive performance on a brief battery of neuropsychological tests . 
 recruitment for adapt began in 2002  and the study was completed in 2007 . 
 in 2005  the roskamp institute initiated a proteomic ancillary study ( f. crawford  pi ) involving blood draw from these subjects . 
 the inclusion criteria for this ancillary study stipulated that each subject was an active adapt participant and had met all the adapt inclusion and exclusion criteria . 
 a separate consent was also obtained from each subject who participated in the ancillary study . 
 two hundred and fifteen subjects from the roskamp adapt cohort enrolled in the proteomic ancillary study .   at the time of blood draw 
  subjects maintained cognitively normal status as determined by their performance on an annual cognitive assessment battery . 
 blood was collected during the semi - annual followup visits  and the cognitive assessments were performed at the baseline visit and at the annual visits . 
 the time from baseline cognitive testing to the diagnosis of mci / ad was 4.06 years ( 1.3 sd ) . 
 timeframe from baseline cognitive testing to blood draw was 2.25 years ( 0.71  sd ) and from blood draw to diagnosis was 1.79 years ( 1.2 sd ) . 
 the cognitive measures completed at baseline and annual followup included the modified mini - mental state examination ( 3ms ) ; the hopkins verbal learning test - revised ( hvlt - r ) ; digit span ( forward and backward ) from the wechsler adult intelligence scale - revised ( wais - r ) ; a generative verbal fluency test ( supermarket items ) ; the narratives from the rivermead behavioral memory test ( rbmt ) ; the brief visuospatial memory test - revised ( bvmt - r ) . 
 the mini - mental state examination ( mmse )   was extracted from 3ms . 
 alternate forms were utilized annually for the hvlt - r  rbmt  and bvmt - r on each subsequent annual visit . 
 subjects also completed the 30-item geriatric depression scale   and a self - rating scale of memory functions . 
 collateral respondents completed the dementia severity rating scale ( dsrs ) .   due to significant intercorrelations between these tests  analyses described below 
 are limited to those baseline cognitive tests that were sensitive to early changes ( i.e.  verbal learning and memory ) associated with mci / ad   or tests that were similar to those previously shown to be associated with a levels .   normative data from the cache county study was used to develop the standardized cut - off scores utilized in adapt . 
 individuals who scored below the cut scores on annual cognitive assessments underwent further dementia workup including physical and neurological examinations  laboratory studies ( i.e.  cbc  chemistry count  sedimentation rate  vitamin b12 and folic acid levels  thyroid test  and syphilis serological test )  and neuroimaging ( i.e.  mri or ct )  as applicable . 
 a more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was also administered by a neuropsychologist as part of the dementia work - up . 
 this battery of tests consisted of the expanded consortium to establish a registry for alzheimer 's disease ( cerad ) battery ; logical memory i and ii of the wechsler memory scale - revised ; benton visual retention test   ( benton ) ; a generative fluency test ( animals ) ; control oral word association test ( cowat ; cfl ) ; the trail making test ; symbol digit modalities test ( smdt ) ; shipley vocabulary . 
 following completion of all components of the dementia work - up  a consensus team determined cognitive status using published diagnostic criteria . 
 the diagnosis of ad was made using nincds - adrda   and amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) using petersen criteria . 
 all mci patients were considered to be amnestic mci  as they only had memory impairment  but maintained normal activities of daily living and overall had a well - preserved cognition in other cognitive domains . 
 ample evidence indicates that amnestic mci patients may be in a transitional stage between normal aging and ad with 85% of these subjects converting to ad over a 7-year period . 
 additional evidence comes from an imaging study which demonstrated that the pattern of brain atrophy in amnestic mci patients is typical of that observed in ad patients . 
 it is then reasonable to combine these diagnoses in a single category  thus allowing a large enough numbers to supply statistical power . of the 215 subjects who gave blood for the ancillary study  two developed non - ad dementia  and 
 of the remaining subject pool of 208 used in these analyses  28 subjects met criteria for either ad ( n = 10 ) or mci ( n = 18 ) in the two years following blood draw . 
 the serum a content was determined  as per manufacturer 's instructions  using the elisa kits for human a140 and a142 and the inter - assay cv  and the intraassay cv was reported to be 10% ( invitrogen  calif ) . 
 dna was extracted from whole blood for apoe genotyping using pure gene kits ( gentra systems  calif )  and apoe genotyping was performed using previously established methods  as described elsewhere . 
 apoe genotypes were unavailable for 4 individuals  but these were included in the analyses . 
 the data set was range checked  and prior to analyses  the dependent and independent variables were examined for missing data  outliers  and violations of the normalcy assumption . 
 differences among groups on demographic variables  neuropsychological variables  and serum a140 levels were examined using either the student 's t - test or  analyses  depending on the type of variable measurement . 
 time - updated cox regression modeling was used to test whether neuropsychological test scores  a  or a combination of both can predict conversion to mci / ad in individuals who were cognitively normal at baseline . 
 potential confounding variables shown to impact risk for cognitive decline included age  education  gender  apoe status  serum creatinine  triglycerides  presence of apoe 4 allele  and history of vascular disease as determined by treatment with statins or antihypertensive medication which were entered as covariates .   the latter variables  coded dichotomously  have been previously shown to impact a levels . 
 because previous analyses revealed a nonsignificant increase of ad risk with naproxen in this cohort  we also controlled for this effect . 
 logistic regression modeling was employed to construct receiver operator curves ( roc ) to examine the predictive performance of neuropsychological measures from the baseline visit and serum a levels in diagnoses of mci / ad . 
 roc curve comparisons were based on area under the curve ( auc )  se  and the associated 95% confidence interval ( ci ) . 
 we subsequently calculated sensitivity of the various models using the predicted probability of each subject by logistic regression modeling with specificity of at least eighty percent . 
 post hoc power calculations using the g - power software for multivariate regression analyses utilized here suggest a power of nearly 100% at the alpha value 0.05 for the current sample size  total number of predictors  and the observed effect size . 
 the mean age and education of the sample was 76.7 ( sd = 3.9 ) and 14.6 ( sd = 2.8 ) years  respectively . 
 the majority of the sample was caucasian ( 98.1% )  and 51.9% were male . despite the cohort 's self - report of enriched family history  less than one - third of the total sample ( 31.7% ) carried at least one apoe 4 allele  a frequency similar to the general population . 
 comparisons on variables between subjects who remained cognitively normal and those who declined over the short follow - up period are reported in table 1 . 
 although all subjects at enrollment performed within the normal limits based on the established cut - off scores  those that ultimately declined had generally poorer scores on the 3ms  mmse  and all memory measures . 
 the two groups were also significantly different on serum a142 levels and a142/a140 ratios prior to diagnoses of mci / ad . 
 only 23% of the cognitively normal individuals had serum a142 in the lowest quartile compared to the nearly 50% of the diagnostic group ( 44% of mci subjects and 50% of ad subjects ) . 
 time - dependent cox regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between these cognitive tests and a on the prediction of subsequent conversion to mci / ad . 
 all neuropsychological analyses were adjusted for age  gender  and education  but no adjustment for the study medications was required as these were baseline scores . 
 cox regression analyses show that the model using neuropsychological tests predicted mci / ad ( 2 log - likelihood = 206.51   = 52.11  df = 8  p < .001 ) . 
 significant individual neuropsychological measures were 3ms (  = 0.25  0.06  wald = 17.78  p < .001 ) ; generative verbal fluency (  = 0.12  0.04  wald = 8.09  p < 
 .004 ) ; hvlt - r scores (  = 0.24  0.11  wald = 4.58 p < .032 ) . 
 cox regression analysis showed that a142 measured in the lowest two quartiles compared to the highest quartile was a significant individual predictor of conversion to mci / ad in this model ( 2 log - likelihood = 197.47   = 38.41  df = 15  p < .001 ) . 
 the regression analysis utilizing the a142/a140 ratio found similarly significant results ( 2 log - likelihood = 204.69   = 36.10  df = 14  p < .001 ) with the lowest ratios being most predictive of subsequent conversion to mci / ad . the final full model  adjusting for confound and the study medications  included hvlt - r  fluency  3ms  a142 levels  and a142 quartiles ( 2 log - likelihood = 166.25   = 74.55  df = 18  p < .001 ) with fluency  3ms  and a142 in the lowest two quartiles as significant individual predictors of mci / ad in the model . 
 similar results were observed when a140 levels and a142 quartiles were substituted in this model with a142/a140 ratios ( 2 log - likelihood = 168.49   = 72.90  df = 17  p < .001 ) . 
 baseline values for the 3ms  hvlt - r  and generative verbal fluency scores were subtracted from those obtained at the 12-month repeat testing to determine if changes in these measures differ by a142 and a142/a140 ratios . in unadjusted analyses  among subjects who converted to mci / ad  the greatest decline for hvlt - r was observed among individuals with the lowest quartile of a142 ( 1.17    2.33  sd ) and a142/a140 ratios ( 0.75  2.63  sd ) where individuals in the highest quartile of a142 ( 1.33    1.86  sd ) and a142/a140 ratios improved by nearly one point ( 0.6  1.82 sd ) . 
 however  these differences were not statistically significant ( p > .05 ) .    for the 3ms scores  among subjects who converted to mci / ad  those with a142 in the lowest quartile declined ( 1.83  1.28  sd ) as compared to the highest quartile ( 4.83  1.35  sd )  and this difference was statistically significant ( f = 3.42   p = .033 ) .   for mci / ad subjects with the lowest quartile of the a142/a140 ratios  the 3ms values remained ultimately unchanged ( 0.16  1.20  sd )  
 while the scores improved among those with the highest quartile of the a142/a140 ratios ( 4.33  1.20  sd )  and these differences were also statistically significant ( f = 3.10  p = .046 ) .   for generative verbal fluency test  a decline was noted in both the lowest quartile ( 4.17  1.40  sd ) and the highest quartile ( 1.17  2.13  sd ) of a142  and these differences were marginally significant ( f = 2.63  p = .073 ) .   for a142/a140 ratios  
 a similar pattern was observed  but this difference was not statistically significant .   among individuals who remained cognitively normal  
 while a similar pattern was observed  those with lowest quartile of a142 and a142/a140 ratios had a larger decline than those with the highest quartile for each hvlt - r ( 0.28  0.27  sd versus . 
 0.14  0.33  sd  respectively . ) and 3ms ( 1.02  0.51  sd versus 0.39  0.44  sd ) . 
 however  due to the small magnitude of the change in these scores  these differences were not statistically significant . 
 no such change was observed for the generative verbal fluency test ( data not shown ) . 
 examination of sensitivity and specificity using roc analysis revealed the auc for neuropsychological testing with age  education  and gender as covariates was 0.83 ( 95% ci [ 0.750.91 ]  p < .001 ) .   for a142 
 ( adjusted for presence of apoe 4 allele  vascular risk factors  and associated medications )  the auc was 0.79 ( 95% ci [ 0.700.88 ]  p < .001 ) .   when neuropsychological testing ( 3ms  hvlt - r  and generative verbal fluency ) and a142 were combined  the auc was increased to 0.91 ( 95% ci [ 0.860.95 ]  p < .001 ) .   for the adjusted ( as above ) a142/a140 ratios alone  
 .001 )  and when combined with the neuropsychological measures  auc was 0.91 ( 95%ci [ 0.870.96 ]  p < .001 ) . 
 optimal sensitivities with specificity of at least 80% predicted probabilities are shown in table 2 .   the highest sensitivity and specificity 
 was achieved using a combination of cognitive scores and a142/a140 ratio  but this finding was driven by a142 . 
 the pathogenesis of ad is initiated before the clinical symptoms of cognitive impairment and functional decline become apparent in its victims . 
 a simple and pragmatic method for identifying older adults at an increased risk for mci / ad who may benefit from targeted prevention is therefore of importance in reducing the burden of ad . 
 the combination of brief neuropsychological tests along with blood - based biomarkers of ad represents a reasonable approach with a potential for wide - scale use . 
 our findings here provide support for this notion and demonstrate that early prediction of risk for developing mci / ad may be feasible via a combination of brief neuropsychological tests and biomarkers in an at - risk cohort . in this subcohort from adapt  measures of global cognitive function ( 3ms )  episodic memory ( hvlt - r trial 4 )  language fluency  and serum a142/a140 ratio achieved an excellent accuracy of 91% . furthermore  sensitivity with specificity of at least 80% for the combined measures was superior to neuropsychological measures or to serum a levels alone . 
 we have recently shown that a levels alone can predict mci / ad  but a levels are influenced by vascular disease and associated medications   and require adjustment to observe the full impact of a in predictive modeling . 
 we have also shown that in subjects diagnosed with ad  there is an association between measures of language tests of fluency and object naming and a140 and that memory performance is associated with serum a142    . 
 an association between serum a140 and cognitive measures of memory and language has also been reported in cognitively normal older adults . 
 high baseline a142 and a140 with stable a142 over time is shown to be associated with diminishing cognition . 
 more recently  yaffe and colleagues demonstrated that low a142/a140 ratios predict cognitive decline over 9 years . in our study  we demonstrate that low a142 and a142/a140 ratios are associated with cognitive decline even within one year . 
 this is extremely valuable from the clinical perspective  as the ability to identify at - risk individuals within a year prior to the onset can significantly improve the quality of care and the recruitment strategy for prevention trials by redirecting those individuals who may not benefit from preventive therapies towards more suitable clinical intervention . 
 this is demonstrated by recent adapt findings  which suggest that individuals with low baseline cognitive scores converted soon after the trial initiated and that neither naproxen nor celecoxib intervention was beneficial to these individuals . 
 collectively  these findings suggest that combining cognitive tests with blood a may be useful for predicting future mci / ad  which to date has not been explored  particularly as either a or the cognitive tests alone may not have the desired sensitivity or specificity for prediction of future mci / ad . 
 this current work presented here provides evidence that the combination of brief neuropsychological tests and blood a has potential utility in predicting mci / ad at least 2 to 4 years prior to the clinical classification of mci or diagnosis of ad . 
 in addition  our findings also demonstrate the importance of accounting for factors such as apoe  vascular risk factors  and medications when using a in predicting mci / ad . 
 although at present no studies have reported sensitivity and specificity of csf a142 in predicting mci / ad conversion from normal cognition  a large multicenter study has shown that csf a142 predicts transition from mci to ad  while tau alone achieved a high sensitivity ( 83% ) with acceptable specificity ( 72% ) . 
 it is interesting to note that our findings using blood and cognitive tests  a far less invasive method  resulted in higher sensitivities and specificities for predicting cognitive decline in at - risk cognitively normal older adults . despite the limitation that blood sampling was not conducted at the same time point as the cognitive testing  
 our data provide strong support for further evaluation of this approach  particularly as we have not seen significant fluctuations in a levels over a one - year period ( pers . 
 our study provides support that blood - based a levels may have diagnostic utility when combined with neuropsychological measures .   this proposed method warrants further investigation to determine its practical applicability in specialized clinic setting by allied health personal and in routine primary care clinics .","


Abstract:
This study investigated the usefulness of brief neuropsychological tests and serum A levels as predictive measures for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in older adults. Results showed that baseline measurements of global cognition, memory, language fluency, and serum A142 predicted future MCI/AD with high accuracy. This suggests that brief neuropsychological tests and serum A levels may be effective in identifying individuals at risk for pathological cognitive decline.

Research and Discussion:
A total of 208 cognitively normal subjects were measured for serum A levels, and 28 of them developed MCI or AD over the follow-up period. Cox regression with demographic variables, genetic risk factors, and medication use as covariates revealed that serum A142 and the ratio of A142/A140 were significant predictors for future MCI/AD. These results suggest that measuring A142 levels through a simple blood test may be a practical and cost-effective method for identifying at-risk individuals for pathological cognitive decline.

Results and Conclusion:
The study achieved an optimal sensitivity of 85.2% and specificity of 86.5% for predicting MCI/AD using ROC analyses. This indicates that brief neuropsychological tests and serum A measurements could potentially be useful in large-scale screening for identifying older adults at risk for pathological cognitive decline. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and determine the clinical utility of these measures in clinical practice. "

Abstract: This study compares serum levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans among residents of two homes who consumed contaminated eggs and beef raised at the homes, to those of matched comparison subjects. Significant elevations were found in residents of both homes, indicating that contaminated food contributed to the body burden of these compounds.

Research and Discussion: The research findings confirm that consumption of contaminated animal products contributes significantly to the body burden of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans. The levels observed in the highest exposed participants were higher than those reported in other studies, and comparable to levels observed in urban populations. Epidemiological and toxicological evidence supports reducing exposures to these compounds, which have been linked to adverse health effects.

Results and Conclusion: Residents who consumed contaminated eggs and beef from two homes showed 2-6 fold elevations in their serum levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans. These elevations were most significant in the home where contaminated eggs and beef were consumed for longer periods. The study highlights the need for soil reference values and risk assessments to include contamination from home-produced animal products. Exposure reduction measures, such as identifying and mitigating sources of contamination, should be implemented to protect human health. "
"the wnt/-catenin pathway has been implicated in the development and progression of melanoma and a wide range of cancer types  including colorectal cancer  breast cancer  esophageal carcinoma  and liver cancer [ 13 ] . under normal conditions  
 increases in expression and binding of certain wnt ligands to frizzled receptor or mutations in specific components of the -catenin degradation assembly deactivate this regulatory mechanism . 
 nuclear -catenin stimulates transcription of a large number of tcf/-catenin responsive genes that include cyclin d1  c - myc [ 5  6 ]  and the melanocyte - specific gene  microphthalmia - associated transcription factor mitf - m . 
 thus  accumulation of nuclear -catenin as observed in several cancer types is considered a marker of canonical wnt/-catenin pathway deregulation and unfavorable prognosis [ 3  8 ] . 
 previous studies have reported an association between nuclear -catenin accumulation and melanoma progression and suggested nuclear -catenin to be a marker of poor prognosis [ 1  7 ] . 
 however  recent studies have shown that contrary to breast and colon cancer  metastatic progression of melanoma is associated with decreases in nuclear and cytoplasmic -catenin expression [ 9  10 ] . moreover  clinical  genetic  and histological studies suggest that nuclear and cytoplasmic -catenin may be used as biomarkers of good prognosis in melanoma [ 1114 ] . recently  hhr6  a human homologue of the yeast rad6 gene and a principal component of the postreplication dna repair pathway  has been identified as an important regulator of canonical wnt/-catenin signaling [ 15  16 ] . 
 hhr6  referred hereafter as rad6  stabilizes -catenin by polyubiquitin modifications that render -catenin resistant to 26s proteasomal degradation . 
 furthermore  rad6 is a transcriptional target of -catenin  thus revealing a positive feedback loop between -catenin - mediated activation of rad6 gene expression and rad6-induced -catenin stabilization . 
 rad6 expression is low in normal breast tissues ; however  increases in rad6 protein expression are detected in hyperplastic  ductal carcinoma in situ ( dcis ) and invasive breast carcinomas . 
 we have previously demonstrated a role for rad6 in breast cancer progression through its regulatory effect on the canonical wnt/-catenin pathway . since the decrease / loss of nuclear -catenin [ 9  10 ]  rather than increases as in breast cancer  
 is linked to melanoma progression  it is not known whether rad6 and -catenin work in concert to promote melanoma pathogenesis . 
 furthermore  rad6 expression in the skin has not been investigated  and there are no data on the role of rad6 in the pathogenesis of benign ( nevi ) and malignant ( melanoma ) melanocytic lesions . 
 it is important to address this gap in knowledge because of the unmet medical need for new effective antimelanoma therapies and because rad6 and -catenin have been identified as therapeutic targets [ 19  20 ] . in this study  we examined rad6 and -catenin expressions in serial sections of nevi  primary  and metastatic melanomas to determine their potential roles in melanoma development and metastatic progression . 
 our data suggest that membranous relocation of -catenin and upregulation of rad6 are independent markers of melanoma development and progression . 
 we also offer a hypothesis that explains the role of membranous -catenin relocation and decreasing cytoplasmic -catenin in melanoma development  a phenomenon that has been linked to unfavorable prognosis [ 9  21  22 ] . 
 cases were retrieved from the files of the pinkus dermatopathology laboratory ( pdl )  a private dermatopathology laboratory located in monroe  mi . preserved paraffin - embedded tissue specimens collected for each case were assigned an accession code that excluded patient identifier information . 
 nevus and primary melanoma cases were selected for study using random numbers generated by a uniform random number generator ( stata / mp 13.1 ) . 
 the study groups consisted of 30 cases of melanocytic nevi  29 cases of primary cutaneous melanoma  and 29 cases of metastatic cutaneous melanoma . 
 the study includes all metastatic cutaneous melanoma samples that were archived between 2010 and 2012 . 
 the number of cases for each nevus and primary melanoma subtype was determined to reflect the lesion 's relative representation in cases obtained at the pdl during the above period . 
 atypical nevi were diagnosed using criteria originally proposed by clark and lesion architecture as reviewed by roth et al . . 
 primary antibodies used in the study are as follows : ( i ) anti--catenin ( is702 ) was purchased from dako ( glostrup  denmark ) and used in an undiluted form ; and ( ii ) anti - rad6 ( ab31917 ) was purchased from abcam ( cambridge  ma ) and used at a 1  :  500 dilution . in humans  the yeast homologous rad6 gene is duplicated and the proteins encoded by the two genes hhr6a ( or rad6a ) and hhr6b ( rad6b ) from chromosomes xq24-q25 and 5q23-q31  respectively  share 95% identical amino acid residues . 
 neither ab31917  our own rad6 antibody  nor any other commercially available anti - rad6 antibody is currently able to distinguish between rad6a and rad6b proteins . 
 therefore  rather than referring as rad6a or rad6b  we refer to the protein detected by the antibody as rad6 . 
 briefly  five - micrometer sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded ethanol . for antigen retrieval  
 sections were microwaved in citrate buffer ph 6.0 ( biogenex  san ramon  ca  usa ) for 12  min at 95c and cooled for 30  min prior to immunostaining . 
 sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15  min  followed by incubation with primary antibody for 60  min . 
 an automated immunostainer ( i6000 ; biogenex ) was utilized for subsequent incubation steps : sections were incubated in multilink biotinylated anti - igg for 20  min  horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody for 20  min  followed by development with 3-amino-9-ethyl - carbazole for 10  min ( biogenex ) . 
 all incubation steps were performed at room temperature  and sections were washed with tris - buffered saline between incubations . 
 lung and colon cancer tissues were included as positive controls for immunostaining with anti--catenin antibody  and breast cancer tissues were included as positive controls for staining with anti - rad6 antibody . 
 stained sections were independently enumerated by two coauthors ( d. r. mehregan and m. campbell )  who were blinded to patient medical records for each case . 
 blinded enumeration was performed under light microscopy at 400x magnification  and an ocular grid consisting of a simple square lattice of 100 test points was utilized to count the number of positively and negatively stained melanomas or nevus cells for each section . per section  the total number of positively and negatively stained cells was counted for each of three sequential horizontal fields . 
 the mean value of the three fields was used to estimate the relative density of cells in a specimen . to increase assessment accuracy  all positively and negatively stained melanomas or nevus cells in a visual field 
 when independent readings for positively stained cells differed by 20% for a given section  both evaluators reviewed the section together to establish a consensus reading . 
 a specimen was considered negative if less than 4% of the cells were immunostained for rad6 or -catenin . 
 a tumor was considered to be stained with high intensity if > 50% of the cells in a specimen expressed rad6 or -catenin  similar to the criteria used by mineta et al . . 
 kruskal - wallis tests were used to compare groups on the basis of continuous variables such as age and percent positive cells . 
 chi - square tests for differences in proportions were used to compare groups on the basis of categorical variables such as gender and -catenin localization . 
 spearman 's rank correlation was used to assess the pairwise association between age and percent of rad6 positive and -catenin positive cells . 
 multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the simultaneous association of rad6 and age with diagnostic group . 
 adjustments were made for multiple comparisons using wilcoxon rank sum tests with bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons . 
 our analysis included 30 individuals diagnosed with nevi  29 with primary melanoma  and 29 with metastatic melanoma ( table 1 ) . 
 these groups differed marginally with respect to gender ( p = 0.08 ) and significantly in age ( p = 0.0001 ) . 
 significant age differences were observed between individuals with nevi and those with either primary melanomas ( p = 0.02 ) or metastatic melanomas ( p = 0.0001 ) . 
 in contrast  no age difference is observed between individuals with primary and metastatic melanomas ( p = 0.27 ) . 
 significant differences in age were also observed between groups defined by -catenin localization ( p = 0.007 ) . 
 individuals with -catenin localized in the cytoplasm were significantly younger than individuals with -catenin localization at the cell membrane ( p = 0.02 ) and marginally younger than individuals with -catenin localization at both the cytoplasm and the cell membrane ( p = 0.05 ) . when age was categorized as < 50  5060  and > 60 years  there were statistically significant differences in rad6 expression between the groups ( p = 0.0008 )  although there is substantial variability ( table 2 ) . 
 median rad6 is greater in the group of people older than 60 years compared to the 5060 years old group ( p = 0.04 ) and < 50 years old group ( p = 0.001 ) . 
 a 20% discrepancy of positively stained cells between the two evaluators was observed in fewer than 5% of the cases  and these cases were evaluated together to establish a consensus reading . 
 melanoma development and progression were not associated with significant changes in percentage of specimens expressing -catenin . 
 -catenin staining was observed in 97% of nevi and in all primary and metastatic melanomas . 
 also  the percentages of nevi ( 93% )  primary melanoma ( 97% )  and metastatic melanoma ( 93% ) that expressed -catenin in more than 50% of the cells did not differ significantly ( figures 1  2  and 3 ) . 
 however  significant differences were observed between the percentages of nevi ( 59% )  primary melanoma ( 90% )  and metastatic melanoma ( 56% ) that expressed -catenin in more than 90% of the cells ( p = 0.02 ; figure 2 ) . 
 these differences were greatly impacted by the percentage of primary melanomas ( 48% ) that expressed -catenin in 100% of the cells  which was approximately twofold higher than the percentages of nevi ( 21% ) or metastatic melanoma ( 26% ) ( data not shown ) . 
 none of the nevi or melanomas expressed -catenin in the nucleus ( figure 1 ) . 
 the percentage of tumors that expressed membranous -catenin increased dramatically from nevi ( 10% ) to primary and metastatic melanomas ( 83% and 93%  resp . ; 
 concurrently with this increase  the percentage of tumors that expressed cytoplasmic -catenin decreased from nevi ( 90% ) to primary and metastatic melanomas ( 45% and 38%  resp . ; 
 in contrast  no significant differences were observed between the percentages of primary and metastatic melanomas that expressed -catenin at either the membrane ( 83% and 93%  resp . ; 
 p = 0.289 ) or the cytoplasm ( 45% and 38%  resp . ; p = 0.633 ; figure 4 ) . while all four nevi types ( junctional  intradermal  compound  and atypical ) expressed -catenin in the cytoplasm  only junctional and atypical nevi expressed -catenin at the plasma membrane . 
 as opposed to nevi types  the three primary melanoma types examined ( superficial spreading  nodular  and lentigo maligna ) did not differ in -catenin localization as -catenin was localized at the plasma membrane  in the cytoplasm  or in both ( figure 4 ) . 
 conversely  all primary melanomas ( 100% ) and the majority of metastatic melanomas ( 96% ) exhibited greater than 50% rad6 expression . 
 the increase in tumor populations expressing rad6 from 37% of nevi to 100% of primary and metastatic melanomas was significant ( p = 0.0001 ; figures 1  2  and 3 ) . 
 melanoma progression from primary to metastatic disease was not associated with changes in the ( i ) percentage of melanomas expressing rad6 ( 100% of primary and metastatic melanomas )  or ( ii ) percentage of melanomas expressing rad6 in more than 50% of the tumor cells ( 100% and 96% of primary and metastatic melanomas  resp . ) . 
 the increase in proportion of tumor populations  expressing rad6 in more than 50% of the cells in primary melanoma ( 67% ) versus metastatic melanoma ( 79% ) was not significant ( p = 0.37 ; figure 2 ) . 
 this study was not designed to test whether the distribution of the tumor cells positive for rad6 is the same between the subtypes of nevi . 
 however  the percentages of benign tumors that lacked rad6 were similar between atypical nevi ( 62% ) and the group of other three nevi types ( 59% ) . 
 interestingly  only one of the 30 nevi ( atypical nevus  3% ) expressed rad6 in > 80% of the cells  and none of the primary and metastatic melanomas expressed rad6 in < 40% of the cells ( figure 2 ) . 
 these results prompted us to examine whether rad6 expression can serve as a marker for histological diagnosis of melanoma . using a multiple logistic regression model 
  we found that the strength of rad6 expression is a strong predictor of melanoma ( p < 0.001 ) even when age group ( p = 0.65 ) and gender ( p = 0.24 ) are included in the model . 
 the model predicts that every 1% increase in rad6 expression results in a 9% increase in the probability that a lesion is melanoma . 
 if we assume that a predicted probability of > 0.5 indicates melanoma  the model with only rad6 has sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 80% . 
 these results are very encouraging ; however  they need to be validated in a larger study . the expression profiles of -catenin and rad6 differed considerably in nevi . 
 approximately 93% of nevi expressed -catenin in more than 50% of the cells  whereas only 27% of the same population of nevi expressed rad6 ( figure 2 ) . 
 -catenin and rad6 expressions in nevi were not significantly correlated ( r = 0.06 ; p = 0.77 ) . 
 there is a 2.7-fold difference in the percentage of primary melanomas ( 100% ) expressing rad6 compared to nevi ( 37% ) and virtually no difference in -catenin expression between primary and metastatic melanomas ( 100% ) . 
 accordingly  rad6 and -catenin expressions in primary melanoma were not correlated ( r < 0.001  p > 0.99 ) . a significant correlation between rad6 and -catenin positive cells 
 however  this association diminished ( r = 0.40  p = 0.05 ) following the exclusion of two observations which are disproportionally influential ( one with < 50% positive rad6 and one with < 50% positive -catenin ) . 
 this is the first study to characterize rad6 expression in cutaneous benign and malignant melanocytic tumors . in this study 
  we examined the association between rad6 and -catenin expressions in benign and malignant melanocytic tumors to determine whether rad6 works in concert with -catenin to influence melanoma development and progression . 
 rad6 and -catenin positively regulate each other in breast cancer [ 15  18 ] . however  while -catenin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of melanoma and other cancer types  data about the role of rad6 in cancer pathogenesis are mostly limited to breast cancer . 
 therefore  we hypothesized that comparison of rad6 and -catenin expressions in the same nevi and melanoma tumors would help determine whether these two signals collaborate to promote melanoma development and progression as they do in breast cancer [ 15  28 ] . 
 accumulation of nuclear and cytoplasmic -catenin has been implicated in driving the development and progression of several cancer types ( e.g.  colon and ovarian cancers ) [ 2931 ] . however  our results show that the expression levels of -catenin do not contribute to melanoma initiation and progression since no difference in -catenin levels was found between nevi  primary melanoma  and metastatic melanoma ( 93%97% of all samples expressed -catenin in > 50% of the tumor cells ) . 
 the high expression levels of -catenin are in line with the crucial role of -catenin in differentiation and proliferation of both normal melanocytes and metastatic melanoma cells . also  our findings are in agreement with previous reports of positive -catenin staining in nevi ( 100% ) and primary melanoma ( 95%  94% ) but are higher than reported in metastatic melanoma ( 75%  68% ) [ 9  21 ] . the variation in expression of -catenin levels in metastatic melanomas between the studies 
 while we studied only melanoma metastases to the skin  other studies either obtained 58% of their specimens from lymph nodes  tonsil  and liver or did not identify the anatomical site of their metastases [ 9  21 ] . 
 furthermore  different anatomical sites may regulate dissimilar antigen expressions in metastases that originate from the same primary tumor in the same patient [ 33  34 ] . 
 previous studies have shown higher percentages of nuclear -catenin in nevi than in melanoma ( 84% versus 33%  and 44% versus 15% ) [ 9  22 ] . 
 those observations provided the basis for the currently held concept that loss of nuclear and cytoplasmic -catenin suggest poor prognosis and decreased overall survival of melanoma patients [ 12  22 ] . in light of these data  the absence of nuclear -catenin in all the nevi and melanomas analyzed in our study was surprising . 
 usage of different anti--catenin antibodies may explain in part the discrepancy in nuclear -catenin expression observed between the studies . 
 however  our results are consistent with the lack of nuclear -catenin reported in four studies which comprised 57 nevi  more than 55 primary melanomas  and 20 metastatic melanomas [ 21  3537 ] . 
 moreover  nuclear -catenin was not found in either the nevus portion or the melanoma portion of 15 cutaneous lesions and was absent in additional 42 primary melanomas . in another study of 70 primary melanomas  nuclear -catenin was reported in only 6.4% of the melanomas . 
 finally  in a study of 230 primary and metastatic melanomas  nuclear -catenin was reported in only 13 cases ( 5.6% ) and therefore those cases were excluded from analysis . taken together  the absence or negligible amount of nuclear -catenin detected in the aforementioned studies as well as ours suggests possible extranuclear roles for -catenin in nevi and melanoma . 
 this notion is supported by a role for cytoplasmic -catenin to execute functions that do not require nuclear translocation ( e.g.  activation of map kinase p38 and nf - kb ) [ 37  40 ] . 
 a major finding of this study is the association between melanoma development and intracellular redistribution of -catenin . 
 the percentage of cases that expressed -catenin on the cell membrane increased dramatically from 10% in nevi to 83% and 93% in primary and metastatic melanomas  respectively . 
 concurrently  the percentage of cases that expressed cytoplasmic -catenin decreased from 90% in nevi to 45% and 39% in primary and metastatic melanomas  respectively ( figure 4 ) . 
 we hypothesize that the relocation of -catenin from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane may serve as a deactivating mechanism of canonical wnt/-catenin signaling and that the resulting reduction in cytoplasmic -catenin level may contribute to the malignant transformation of melanocytic nevi . 
 the proposed hypothesis is supported by the following observations : ( i ) as in our study  bachmann et al . also reported an association between nevus to melanoma development and relocation of -catenin to the cell membrane . 
 nevertheless  the authors of that study did not offer an explanation for their observation ; ( ii ) our analysis of the data of kagashita et al . 
 showed -catenin decrease in the cytoplasm and increase at the cell membrane and that these changes in -catenin distribution corresponded with the malignant transition of nevi ; ( iii ) wnt4 signal has been identified as a mechanism that can drive -catenin relocation from cytoplasm to cell membrane ; and ( iv ) -catenin relocation from cytoplasm to cell membrane has been reported to block -catenin signaling in a human embryonic kidney ( hek293 ) cell line . 
 of note  this hypothesis can explain how despite the abundant -catenin expression in melanoma [ 1  7 ]  cytoplasmic -catenin is selectively decreased  a phenomenon that has been associated with unfavorable melanoma prognosis [ 9  21  22 ] . 
 our current efforts are directed towards determining if the increases in membranous -catenin observed in primary and metastatic melanomas result from relocation of existing molecules in the cytoplasm or deposition of newly generated -catenin at the membranous site . 
 rad6 has been implicated in early breast cancer development since an increase in rad6 levels is observed in adenosis and benign hyperplasias as compared to normal tissue . 
 in contrast  our findings do not support rad6 to play a similar role in nevus formation as in benign breast neoplasia  since 63% of the nevi were negative for rad6 . 
 rad6 has also been implicated in breast cancer progression because rad6 levels increase with progression from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive primary carcinoma and metastatic cancer [ 15  28 ] . in accordance with the upregulation of rad6 in early stages of breast cancer development as compared to benign hyperplasia [ 15  17 ]  we observed a striking increase in rad6 expression in primary melanoma when compared to nevi . 
 while all primary melanomas displayed strong rad6 staining ( > 50% of the tumor cells )  rad6 was negative in 63% of the nevi . 
 these findings suggest that rad6 may play a role in malignant transformation of nevi as in breast cancer . 
 progression of melanoma from primary to metastatic disease was not significantly associated with further changes in the percentage of tumors expressing rad6 or rad expression intensity as > 50% of tumor cells stained positively in 100% and 96% of primary melanomas and metastatic melanomas  respectively . 
 these findings suggest that rad6 may play a sustained role in melanoma metastasis as it does in melanoma development . in benign and malignant breast tumors  
 rad6 stabilizes -catenin  and  in turn  -catenin positively upregulates rad6 transcription [ 1517 ] . 
 however  this direct positive correlation between -catenin and rad6 expression does not appear to be conserved in melanoma as the expression profiles of -catenin and rad6 differed considerably in nevi . 
 approximately 93% of nevi expressed -catenin compared to only 27% of nevi that expressed rad6 in more than 50% of their cells ( figure 2 ) . 
 these observations suggest that the high -catenin expression in nevi is likely driven by regulators other than rad6 . at first glance 
  it would appear that -catenin and rad6 expressions are correlated in primary melanoma because these proteins were coexpressed in approximately all primary melanomas . also  these findings correspond to the 80% correlation between rad6 and -catenin expressions in primary breast cancer . 
 however  it is unlikely that the high rad6 expression in primary melanoma is driven by the concurrent high -catenin expression  because rad6 expression is low in nevi despite the presence of high cytoplasmic -catenin expression that is comparable to primary melanoma . 
 this notion is confirmed by lack of statistical correlation between rad6 and -catenin expressions in primary melanoma . 
 -catenin is not the only activator of rad6 ; for instance  rad6 is activated by nerve growth factor in nervous tissue . therefore  it is conceivable that  in primary melanoma  rad6 expression is regulated by yet unidentified activators . 
 we also demonstrated that further progression of melanoma from primary to metastatic disease is not associated with a correlation between the -catenin and rad6 expressions . 
 taken together  our study does not support a direct positive interaction between -catenin and rad6 in either benign or malignant melanocytic tumors . 
 we characterized for the first time rad6 expression in cutaneous benign and malignant melanocytic tumors . 
 we are showing a striking upregulation of rad6 from a negative expression in most benign melanocytic tumors to 100% of primary and metastatic melanomas . 
 these findings strongly suggest a role for rad6 in the development of primary melanoma and metastatic disease . 
 we show that in contrast to rad6  -catenin is expressed in more than 50% of the tumor cells in almost all nevi and melanoma tumors . taken together  in contrast to the rad6 -catenin positive relationship in breast cancer [ 1517 ]  our study does not support a similar positive interaction between -catenin and rad6 in benign or malignant melanocytic tumors . 
 finally  our findings suggest a role for the cytoplasmic to membrane translocation of -catenin in the development of primary melanoma . 
 future studies will determine whether newly generated -catenin at the membranous site coincide with -catenin translocation from the cytoplasm ."," thank

1) Abstract: In this study, we investigated the relationship between rad6 and -catenin in melanoma development and progression. Our findings demonstrate a strong correlation between rad6 expression and melanoma progression, as well as a shift in -catenin localization from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm. 

2) Research and Discussion: Our immunostaining data on 88 cutaneous tumors revealed a significant increase in rad6 expression in primary and metastatic melanomas compared to nevi. In contrast, -catenin was highly expressed in all tumor types, but exclusively localized on the cell membrane in nevi and predominantly in the cytoplasm in primary and metastatic melanomas. These results suggest a potential role for rad6 and -catenin in melanoma development through a positive feedback loop. 

3) Results and Conclusion: Our study highlights the involvement of rad6 and -catenin in melanoma development and progression. Our data suggest a possible positive feedback loop between these proteins, and indicate a shift in -catenin localization from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm during melanoma progression. Further investigations into the individual roles of rad6 and -catenin in melanoma development are warranted."
"the guanine heterocyclic 
 ring is rich in chemical reactivity toward 
 oxidants and adduct - forming species . in dna  2-deoxyguanosine 
 ( dg  mass = m ) is the chief site for base oxidation due 
 to its low redox potential leading to many products that are characterized 
 by their mass signatures . 
 the principal products 
 characterized with one - electron oxidants in aqueous solutions can 
 be grouped based on the site of reaction on the radical intermediate 
 resulting from one - electron oxidation of dg . 
 the 2-deoxyribonucleoside products arising from initial 
 reactivity at c5 of dg include a four - electron oxidation 
 product  an imidazolone ( diz  m-39 ) that hydrolyzes to 
 an oxazolone ( dz  m-21 )  and 
 the two - electron oxidation product 5-carboxamido-5-formamido-2-iminohydantoin 
 ( d2ih  m+34 ; scheme 1 ) . 
 when the initial reaction occurs at c8 of dg  either 
 26-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine ( fapy - dg  
 m + 18 ) is observed under reducing conditions or 8-oxo-78-dihydroguanine 
 ( dog  m+16 ) is observed under oxidizing conditions  in 
 which the latter compound is a key marker for monitoring oxidative 
 stress in cells ( scheme 1 ) . 
 the 
 two - electron oxidation product dog is stable but is highly 
 susceptible to further oxidation leading to two hydantoin compounds . 
 the yield for the thermodynamically preferred product spiroiminodihydantoin 
 ( dsp  m + 32 ) is greatest in nucleoside reactions at 
 ph > 6 or in unencumbered reaction contexts ( i.e.  single - stranded 
 dna or g - quadruplexes )  while the yield of 5-guanidinohydantoin ( dgh  m + 6 ) is greatest in nucleoside reactions at ph < 
 6 or in sterically demanding duplex contexts ( scheme 1 ) . 
 the hydantoins are also readily formed from direct four - electron 
 oxidation with o2 . 
 this list of products represents those that are consistently observed 
 from many oxidant systems conducted by several laboratories ; however  
 other compounds have been reported in lower yield . in the cellular context 
  oxidation reactions 
 with dg can have other nucleophilic participants such 
 as amines or phenols . 
 in most cases  when amines or phenols participate in the reaction  
 products 
 are observed with similar backbone structures as characterized 
 with water serving as the nucleophile . 
 for example  when dg is oxidized in the presence of lysine  products retaining the dg heterocycle and those with a core similar to dgh or dsp have been observed . 
 the adducts characterized by 
 our laboratory and others show lysine competing with water for sites 
 of covalent bond formation  where a single lysine is observed at c8 
 analogous to dog  at either c5 or c8 of a spirocyclic 
 core similar to dsp  and last a bis - adduct at c5 and 
 c8 with a spirocyclic ring structure has been identified ( figure 1 ) . 
 the lysine 
 adducts are all stable allowing their quantification and characterization . 
 as a last example 
  the polyamine spermine has been adducted to dg and dog under oxidative conditions . in the dg oxidation studies  a spermine adduct at c8 
 is observed 
 retaining the dg heterocyclic core  while dog oxidations yield an adduct at c5 
 that does not undergo acyl migration to create a spirocycle  but instead 
 the polyamine can generate an unstable hemiaminal intermediate that 
 decomposes leaving a ribosylurea lesion at the adduct formation site . 
 moreover  the facile formation of spermine adducts 
 to dog oxidation intermediates has been harnessed for 
 quantification of dog from dna samples . 
 in contrast to amines  phenols ( i.e.  tyrosine ) are more 
 redox active than amines and better able to compete with dg for oxidant during reactions . 
 the products observed when phenols 
 participate with dg during oxidation have more variability 
 in their structures compared to amine adducts . 
 these model studies aid in understanding 
 the chemical nature of dna  protein cross - links that are detrimental 
 to cellular processes . in the current work  
 oxidations that allowed dg to 
 react with nh3 were conducted while the full product and 
 diastereomer distributions were monitored . 
 after careful characterization 
 of the nucleoside reactions  similar oxidations were conducted in 
 the single - stranded and duplex oligodeoxynucleotide ( odn ) contexts . 
 the purified ammonia adducts were also studied with respect to their 
 decomposition pathways leading to end products that have not been 
 previously determined . 
 lastly  polymerase insertion studies were conducted 
 to test the hypothesis that amine adducts might have altered base - pairing 
 preferences ; every substitution of an oxo group on a base for an amino 
 group converts a hydrogen bond acceptor into a potential hydrogen 
 bond donor . 
 these results provide a fundamental understanding of the 
 stability and base - pairing properties of amine adducts to dg that result during oxidation  which may occur in vivo due to the 
 high concentration of nucleophilic amines in the vicinity of the genome . 
 adducts 
 observed when dg and lysine are allowed to 
 react in the presence of oxidant . 
 the unencumbered nucleoside dg ( 1 mm ) was chosen for 
 the initial oxidation reactions where nh4cl ( 20 mm ) provided 
 the source of nucleophilic nh3 . 
 all reactions were conducted 
 with 75 mm napi buffer at ph 7.4 at 22 c . 
 the oxidants 
 chosen include the photooxidants riboflavin and rose bengal and the 
 one - electron oxidant na2ircl6 . 
 reactions were 
 conducted in triplicate to achieve 70% conversion to products 
 in each reaction  and the products ( scheme 2 ) were analyzed by a dual hplc method . the first round of hplc analysis 
 utilized a reversed - phase column to identify dog ( m+16 ) 
 and 8-amino - dg ( m+15 )  while all other products eluted 
 in the void volume . 
 the void volume from the previous run was collected 
 and analyzed on a hypercarb hplc column that allowed analysis of the 
 hydantoins  ammonia adducts  and dz . 
 however  diz hydrolyzes 
 to dz that was detected on the hypercarb column ; thus  
 formation of diz is inferred from quantification of dz . 
 moreover  the hypercarb hplc column also allowed separation 
 and quantification of all spirocyclic diastereomeric pairs of products . 
 the dgh diastereomers are interconvertible  and thus  their diastereomer ratios are not 
 reported ( see the supporting information for complete experimental details ) . 
 lastly  a test reaction with 
 na2ircl6 was conducted in which half was directly 
 analyzed by the hypercarb hplc column and the other half was analyzed 
 by the dual hplc method outlined above . 
 the product distributions 
 observed from these comparative studies were within 3% of 
 one another . 
 the photooxidant riboflavin led to the largest number 
 of different 
 products and was used to obtain suitable amounts of material for characterization . 
 esi - ms ( figure s1  supporting information )  and the adducts observed that did not involve participation of 
 nh3 during product formation included dz ( m 
 - 21 )  dog ( m + 16 )  dgh ( m + 6 )  and dsp ( m + 32  scheme 2 ) . 
 confirmation 
 of their structures was achieved by esi - ms / ms fragmentation 
 of the free bases while monitoring the daughter fragments . 
 the esi - ms / ms experiments were conducted on hplc purified nucleosides 
 in which the n - glycosyl bond was cleaved in the ionization 
 source to liberate free bases that were further fragmented in the 
 cid chamber to generate the daughter fragments used in identification 
 of the structures . 
 the ms / ms fragmentation spectra were compared to 
 literature values for the two dsp diastereomers ( figure 2 ) and dz to further confirm their structural 
 assignments ( figures s2 and s3  supporting information ) . 
 the structure for dsp has been further established 
 by x - ray crystallography and nmr . 
 ammonia adducts observed included two pairs 
 of chromatographic peaks for the diastereomers of spirodi(iminohydantoin)-2-deoxyribonucleosides 
 ( dsi )  whose names are based on the site of nh3 attachment to guanine  thus 5-dsi ( m + 31 ) and 8-dsi ( m + 31 ) ( scheme 2  see reference 
 cited for the correct dsi iupac nomenclature ) . to confirm the identities of the 5- and 8-dsi constitutional isomers and their respective 
 diastereomers  esi - ms / ms of the free bases were conducted 
 ( figure 2 ) . 
 comparison of the esi - ms / ms spectrum for 5-dsi with dsp gave 
 a pair of peaks for 5-dsi that established c5 as the 
 site of nh3 attachment ( m / z [ m + h ] = 140 and 96  figure 2 ) . 
 as for 8-dsi  comparison of its esi - ms / ms 
 spectrum with those obtained from dsp and 5-dsi identified new masses that are best explained by nh3 attachment 
 at c8 ( m / z [ m + h ] = 
 141 and 97  figure 2 ) . on the basis of the 
 proposed mechanism ( scheme 2 )  a product that 
 includes bis - addition of nh3 at c5 and c8 of an oxidized 
 guanine to yield a spirocycle ( 58-dsi  m+30 ) is possible ; however  this adduct was not observed 
 for reasons that will be elaborated on below . 
 additionally  nh3 adducts with a dgh core were not observed most 
 likely due to the fact that the reactions were performed at ph 7.4 
 where yields of dgh are minimal . 
 lastly  the yields of dog ( m + 16 ) and 8-amino - dg ( m + 15 ) were very 
 low ( < 1% ) as determined by lc - esi - ms ( figure s1  supporting information ) ; hence  their quantities 
 are not reported . 
 the nucleosides dog and c8 amine - adducted dg have redox potentials that are 600 mv below the 
 parent nucleoside dg causing them to be much more susceptible 
 to further oxidation . 
 further  one - electron oxidized dog was observed to have an even lower redox potential than 
 the parent compound dog  which means that once oxidation of dog  and likely 8-amino - dg  occurs product formation is inevitable due to 
 the 70% conversion to product that yielded the spirocyclic 
 compounds dsp  5-dsi  or 8-dsi . 
 esi - ms / ms spectra for dsp ( top )  5-dsi ( middle )  and 8-dsi ( bottom ) . 
 the data 
 provided was collected on the first eluting diastereomer of each spirocycle 
 from a hypercarb hplc column . 
 data for the second eluting diastereomer 
 for dsp  5-dsi  and 8-dsi can 
 be found in the supporting information ( figures 
 s2  s4  and s5 ) . 
 the heavy lines represent the fragment observed and 
 the thin lines represent the portion of the molecule lost upon fragmentation . 
 relative product distributions 
 observed with each oxidant system 
 were determined by integration of the hplc peak areas measured at 
 240 nm followed by normalization via each molecule s unique 
 extinction coefficient ( 240 nm ) . 
 extinction coefficients for 5-dsi and 8-dsi are not known but were determined from experiments that 
 are reported below . in the riboflavin - mediated oxidations  
 this result was anticipated because riboflavin is a type i photooxidant 
 and effects oxidation by electron transfer from dg yielding 
 o2 under aerobic reaction conditions . 
 oxidation of dg by one - electron 
 and proton transfer yields an intermediate radical ( dg ) that only couples with o2 to initially yield diz that 
 is prone to hydration leading to dz ( scheme 2 )  the species quantified . 
 the adducts 
 derived from the nucleophile trapping of electrophilic dg oxidation intermediates show nh3 participation through 
 the products 5-dsi ( 29% ) that was the highest yielding 
 nh3 adduct followed by nearly 3-fold less 8-dsi ( 11% ) . 
 the participation of h2o as the trapping nucleophile 
 was identified by the lower yields of dsp ( 11% ) and dgh ( 4% ) . 
 the nucleophilicity of nh3 is much greater 
 than h2o ; therefore  as expected  adducts resulting from 
 nh3 participation dominated over those derived from h2o . 
 relative product distributions observed when dg reacted 
 with nucleophilic h2o or nh3 in oxidation reactions . 
 the oxidants include the photooxidants riboflavin and rose bengal  
 as well as na2ircl6 . 
 reactions were conducted 
 with 1 mm dg  20 mm nh4cl  in 75 mm napi buffer ( ph 7.4 ) at 22 c . 
 ( 1 ) photoactivation of riboflavin 
 ( 200 m ) was achieved with 350 nm light for 3 h  ( 2 ) photoactivation 
 of rose bengal ( 100 m ) was achieved with 350 nm light for 3 
 h  and ( 3 ) oxidation with na2ircl6 ( 10 mm ) was 
 achieved by bolus addition of the salt . 
 results represent the average 
 of triplicate trials and the error is 10% of each reported 
 value . 
 the second oxidant studied was 
 rose bengal  a type ii photooxidant 
 ( o2 ) that furnished 5-dsi as the 
 major product ( 62% ) followed by a 3-fold lower amount of dsp ( 31% )  and low yields of dz ( 5% ) and dgh ( 2% ) were observed to complete the mass balance ( figure 3 ) . as expected  this oxidant did not yield 8-dsi based on its mechanism of oxidation . 
 oxidation of dg by o2 proceeds by 4 + 2 cycloaddition 
 to the imidazole ring  followed by ring opening to yield 8-hoo - g that eliminates water giving the proposed electrophile dog . 
 next  dog is trapped by nucleophiles at 
 c5 leading to dsp with h2o or 5-dsi with nh3 ( scheme 3 ) . 
 support for 
 exclusive nucleophilic attack at c5 under o2 oxidations was derived from h2o studies 
 followed by mapping the labeled site by esi - ms / ms ; the current observation that the only nh3 adducts were the 5-dsi diastereomers further 
 support this previously proposed mechanism  and further confirms our 
 structural assignments for these peaks . 
 comparisons of the product 
 distributions from the photooxidants riboflavin and rose bengal show 
 a dramatic difference with respect to the major product observed ( figure 3 ) . in the riboflavin oxidation  
 dz was 
 the major product while in the rose bengal oxidation  5-dsi was the major product  and these observations can be ascribed to 
 each oxidant s unique mechanism of oxidation ( schemes 2 and 3 ) . 
 product distributions from this oxidant 
 included 
 nearly equivalent distributions of dsp ( 50% ) and 5-dsi ( 42% ) with the mass balance completed by dgh ( 8%  figure 3 ) . in this oxidation reaction 
  
 the distribution did not yield nh3 adducts as the major 
 products  which was unexpected on the basis of nh3 being 
 the better nucleophile compared to h2o . 
 comparison 
 of the product distributions observed with the one - electron 
 oxidants riboflavin and na2ircl6 identified 
 both nh3- and h2o - adducted compounds . 
 the current 
 results differ from those previously reported by our laboratory when 
 lysine was adducted to dg in analogous oxidation reactions . previously  in riboflavin oxidations spirodihydantoins 
 with lysine at c8 were 2-fold greater than those with lysine at c5 
 ( figure 1 )  and in na2ircl6 oxidations a c8 lysine adduct was observed . 
 in contrast to these 
 results  riboflavin oxidations in the presence of nh4cl 
 gave more c5 adducts ( 29% ) than c8 adducts ( 11% )  and na2ircl6 oxidations did not yield detectable amounts of c8 
 adducts . 
 we propose the difference in the current ammonia results 
 compared to the lysine data can be attributed to a difference in the 
 mechanism of product formation for the c8 adduct in the nucleoside 
 context . 
 the former work from our laboratory proposed that c8 amine 
 adducts result from oxidation of the amine to the aminyl radical that 
 adds at the c8 carbon of dg followed by oxidation leading 
 to product formation ( scheme 4 ) . in nucleoside dg  this proposed 
 mechanism best supports the observation of ammonia adducts at c8  
 because upon one - electron oxidation of dg the initial 
 radical cation ( dg ) 
 formed is very acidic ( pka  3.9 ) and rapidly deprotonates to the neutral radical 
 ( dg ) that is not susceptible 
 to nucleophilic attack . thus  dg reacts with o2 yielding diz / dz and not with amines or 
 h2o . 
 formation of amine adducts at c8 must result 
 from a difference in the amine reactivity . 
 the key difference between 
 lysine and ammonia resides in their standard reduction potentials . 
 in general  primary amines ( 1.0 v vs nhe  ph 10 ) have a lower redox potential than ammonia ( > 1.3 v vs 
 nhe  
 ph 9 ) ; this trend should scale down to 
 ph 7  in which the oxidations were conducted . 
 thus  oxidation of lysine 
 to an aminyl radical that adds to c8 of dg is possible 
 with na2ircl6 ( 0.9 v vs nhe  ph 7 ) and riboflavin 
 ( 1.7 v vs nhe  ph 7 ) ; in contrast  the 
 analogous reaction does not readily occur for nh3 because 
 at ph 7 dg is the dominant site of oxidation due to its 
 lower redox potential leading to products other than 8-dsi . in summary  
 one - electron oxidant driven oxidations of dg in the presence of nh3 lead to spirocyclic adducts at 
 c5 and c8 that are in competition with h2o adducts of the 
 same core structure . as the next step  we set out to determine the decomposition 
 products 
 and pathways through which the ammonia adducts proceed . 
 hplc was used 
 to provide diastereomerically pure 5-dsi and 8-dsi samples that were subjected to conditions of ph 3 ( 0.1% formic acid ) 
 or ph 10 ( 20 mm napi ) at 22 c for 30 min or 10 h. 
 not only could the decomposition products be determined  but having 
 diastereomerically pure starting material also allowed us to probe 
 the mechanism of decomposition  specifically for 5-dsi . 
 first  both 5- and 8-dsi were stable 
 at ph 10 during this time frame  while 5-dsi readily 
 hydrolyzed to dsp at ph 3 in 30 min and 8-dsi hydrolyzed to dsp after 10 h. for 5-dsi  deamination of the amine group can occur by two possible mechanisms : 
 ( 1 ) a retro - acyl migration can occur followed by loss of nh3 to yield an electrophilic intermediate ( dog ) susceptible to h2o attack followed by 
 a second acyl migration back to dsp or ( 2 ) acid - catalyzed 
 deamination can occur directly to furnish dsp ( scheme 5 ) . 
 if the retro - acyl migration proceeds on the diastereomerically 
 pure sample  it is expected that a mixture of dsp diastereomers 
 would be observed  and if direct deamination occurs  then only one dsp diastereomer would be predicted . upon incubation of one 
 diastereomer of 5-dsi at ph 3  
 only one diastereomer 
 of dsp was observed  supporting the direct deamination 
 mechanism . 
 moreover  the early eluting 5- and 8-dsi nh3 adducts decomposed to the early eluting dsp isomer 
 and the late eluting adducts deaminated to the later eluting dsp isomer ( figure s6  supporting information ) . 
 these results aid in establishing the absolute configuration of 
 the 5-dsi and 8-dsi diastereomers that will 
 be discussed below . 
 moreover  these results also allude to an explanation 
 as to why the bis - ammonium adduct was not observed in any of the reactions . 
 based on these data  the bis - ammonium adduct  if formed  could rapidly 
 deaminate to yield either 5-dsi or 8-dsi  although this hypothesis could not be further validated . 
 utilization of the hypercarb 
 hplc column for analyzing the product 
 distributions of these spirocycles allowed determination of the diastereomer 
 ratios . 
 it has previously been determined that ( r)-dsp elutes first from this 
 column and ( s)-dsp elutes second . 
 the absolute stereochemistry for the diastereomers 
 of the ammonia adducts had not yet been determined . 
 the results of 
 these studies identified ( r)-dsp and ( s)-dsp yields to be nearly equal . also  for the 5-dsi and 8-dsi ammonia adducts nearly equal 
 yields for the diastereomers were observed . on the basis of these 
 results  the defining point of the reaction to determine product stereochemistry 
 must not be very sterically impeded in order to lead to such a small 
 diastereomer preference . as stated above  the diastereomerically 
 pure ammonia adduct samples 
 were determined to decompose to give a single diastereomer of dsp ; therefore  on the basis of hplc elution order  the absolute 
 configuration for the diastereomers of the two dsi constitutional 
 isomers can be determined . 
 the first - eluting 5-dsi and 8-dsi diastereomers decomposed to the first dsp diastereomer ( r )  and the late - eluting diastereomer 
 decomposed to the late - eluting dsp diastereomer ( s ) ; therefore  for 5-dsi the r diastereomer elutes first and the s diastereomer 
 elutes second  because the r and s assignments are the same between dsp and 5-dsi . 
 in contrast  the r and s assignments 
 for the 8-dsi diastereomers are opposite those of dsp ; thus  ( s)-8-dsi elutes first and ( r)-8-dsi elutes second and from the hypercarb 
 hplc column ( figure 4 ) . 
 these examples provide 
 a fascinating case outlining how the movement of ring substituents 
 affects the r and s stereochemical 
 assignments . 
 assignment of absolute configurations for the diastereomers 
 of dsp  5-dsi  and 8-dsi based 
 on their 
 elution profile from a hypercarb hplc column and their ecd spectra . 
 the r and s assignments for the diastereomers 
 of 8-dsi are the opposite of those for the dsp and 5-dsi isomers with the same geometric configuration 
 of the spirocyclic ring  due to a change in the cahn  ingold 
 the diastereotopic ammonia 
 adducts were then probed by electronic 
 circular dichroism spectroscopy ( ecd ) . 
 previously  ecd was used in 
 tandem with vibrational circular dichrosim spectroscopy  nmr  and 
 x - ray crystallography to establish the absolute configuration for dsp . 
 the ecd spectra for ( r)- and ( s)-dsp isomers gave three lobes that were mirror images 
 of one another  as expected ( figure 4 ) . 
 critical 
 for assigning the absolute configuration for dsp was 
 the low energy lobe  in which the s isomer gave a 
 positive rotation at 258 nm  and the r isomer gave 
 a negative rotation at 259 nm . in comparison 
 to these results  
 the 5-dsi diastereomers gave ecd spectra 
 that were different than dsp but showed a similarity 
 in the low energy lobe ( figure 4 ) . 
 for ( r)-5-dsp  the 
 lobe at 258 nm gave a negative rotation and ( s)-5-dsi gave a positive rotation 
 at 258 nm . 
 the higher energy lobes observed in the 
 ecd for the 5-dsi diastereomers were different than those 
 measured for dsp ( figure 4 ) . 
 as 
 a last comparison  the 8-dsi diastereomer ecd spectra 
 were compared to those recorded for dsp ( note : 8-dsi and dsp isomers with the same geometric 
 configuration of the spirocyclic ring give opposite r and s assignments due to a difference in the cahn 
 the low energy 
 lobe gave a negative rotation at 262 nm similar to ( r)-dsp  and ( r)-8-dsi gave a positive rotation 
 similar to ( s)-dsp . 
 furthermore  the 8-dsi diastereomers also gave similar 
 rotations and energies as their analogous dsp diastereomers 
 at the 238 nm lobe  and 8-dsi and dsp gave similar rotations at the highest energy lobe  but the absolute 
 energy was different ( i.e.  202 nm for 8-dsi and 
 211 nm for dsp ; figure 4 ) . 
 the similarity in the critical low energy lobe further supports 
 the absolute configuration assignments that were made from the deamination 
 studies monitored by hplc . 
 future computational studies to model these 
 ecd spectra will help solidify these conclusions  and may address 
 some of the challenges that occurred during modeling of the ecd spectra 
 for the dsp diastereomers . 
 the 
 ability to deaminate the dsi adducts to dsp allowed the determination of the extinction coefficients 
 for 5- and 8-dsi relative to dsp  in which these were the values used to determine the relative yields . 
 peak areas for identically pure 5-dsi samples were measured 
 before and after incubation in formic acid and the change in peak 
 area measured was used to determine the relative 240  nm compared to the value established for dsp . 
 a similar 
 experiment was conducted for the 8-dsi diastereomers . 
 from these experiments  
 the 240  nm for the 5-dsi and 8-dsi diastereomers were determined 
 to be 3800 and 3500 lmolcm  respectively  which are both slightly greater than that determined 
 for the dsp diastereomers ( 3300 lmolcm ) . 
 the next step from the nucleoside studies 
 was to explore the context 
 dependence of nh3 adduct formation in single- and double - stranded 
 odns ( ssodn and dsodn ) . 
 the photooxidant riboflavin was chosen for 
 the studies because it gave the most diverse distribution of products 
 in the nucleoside reactions and might provide the most insight into 
 context effects . for these studies  the ssodns selected for analysis 
 were the 18-mers odn-1 and odn-2  and the 
 dsodn context was studied via the duplex formed from these two single 
 strands ( odn-12 ) . after oxidation of these odn systems  
 they were digested with a suite of nucleases and phosphatase to the 
 nucleosides followed by analysis using the previously described hplc 
 methods . 
 previously  our laboratory demonstrated that the digestion 
 method used provides complete degradation of dsp - containing 
 odns to nucleosides ; it is assumed that 
 the dsi adducts are equally digested to completion . 
 the 
 nuclease digestion conditions were modified to include ammonium salts 
 for buffer to prevent loss of 5-dsi via deamination to dsp ( scheme 5 )  controls conducted 
 with sodium salts for buffers did not detect 5-dsi due 
 to deamination to dsp during the nuclease digestion ( 18 
 h at ph 5.4  scheme 5 ) . 
 a comparison 
 between the contexts studied when dg was 
 allowed to react with nh3 in the presence of the photooxidant 
 riboflavin is provided in figure 5 . 
 the first 
 observation from these data was with respect to dz distributions 
 that dramatically decreased when proceeding from the nucleoside to 
 odn contexts ; specifically  the dz distribution in the 
 dsodn context ( 2% ) was 10-fold less than the ssodn context ( 20% ) 
 and 20-fold less than that observed in the nucleoside context ( 40% ) . 
 this observation has already been reported in the literature and is 
 proposed to result from the odn context increasing the lifetime of 
 the dg that reacts with 
 nucleophilic h2o to give the c8 product dog while decreasing the lifetime of dg that reacts with o2 to 
 yield dz ( schemes 2 and 6 ) . with respect to 
 the yields of the hydantoins  more dsp relative to dgh was observed in the nucleoside context ( 11% vs 4%  respectively ) 
 versus the dsodn context ( 9% vs 21%  respectively ) . 
 again  this trend 
 follows those in the literature in which the duplex context favors 
 the less sterically demanding product dgh . 
 the nh3 adducts 5-dsi and 8-dsi provided some interesting context - dependent product distributions . 
 the yield of 5-dsi was greatest for the nucleoside ( 29% ) 
 and decreased by half in all odn contexts studied ( 14% ) . in 
 contrast 
  the yield of 8-dsi was smallest for the nucleoside 
 ( 11% ) and increased by more than 3-fold in the ssodn context ( 39% )  
 and over half the products observed in the dsodn context were 8-dsi ( 54% ) . 
 as previously stated  the lifetime of the electrophilic dg is longer in the duplex 
 context and the superior nucleophilicity of nh3 compared 
 to h2o greatly increased the yield of 8-dsi in dsodn oxidations ( scheme 6 ) . 
 furthermore  
 the increase in 8-dsi yield from the dsodn oxidations 
 further supports this product resulting from nucleophilic addition 
 of nh3 at c8 leading to 8-dsi  and not the 
 nh3 aminyl radical adding at c8 to yield the same product . 
 these results clearly demonstrate a dependence on the reaction context 
 in formation of dg oxidation products and nh3 adducts . 
 a look at the distribution of diastereomers resulting from 
 oxidation of the odn contexts gave nearly equal amounts of both r and s diastereomers . 
 this observation 
 parallels our previous work looking at dsp diastereomer 
 formation in single - stranded and duplex contexts . 
 coupled together  these observations support a state of 
 disorder in the duplex at the time of nucleophilic attack at c5 of 
 oxidized dog or 8-amino - dg ( likely intermediates 
 leading to the spirocycles ) that leads to nearly equal covalent bond 
 formation from both the re and si faces of these electrophiles . 
 relative product distributions measured 
 when dg was 
 allowed to react with nh3 in the presence of photoexcited 
 riboflavin in various contexts . 
 reactions were conducted in 75 mm 
 napi buffer ( ph 7.4 ) at 22 c  and 20 mm nh4cl . in 
 the nucleoside studies  1 
 mm dg was studied  and in the 
 odn contexts 20 m ssodn or 10 m dsodn was studied . 
 ( 1 ) 
 photoactivation of riboflavin ( 200 m ) was achieved with 350 
 nm light for 3 h in the nucleoside studies and 30 min in the odn studies . 
 these conditions achieved 70% conversion to product in the 
 nucleoside reactions and 50% in the odn studies . 
 it must first be noted 
 that the bis - ammonium adduct could not be 
 quantified due to its instability  but if formed  the adduct is most 
 likely deaminated to either 5-dsi or 8-dsi . keeping this limitation in mind  
 the oxidation of dg by riboflavin initially 
 yields dg that rapidly 
 deprotonates to dg in 
 the nucleoside contexts ( pka  
 3.9 )  dominating the product - forming 
 step of the reaction . 
 in contrast  dg in the dsodn context retains more cationic character because 
 the acidic proton is h - bonded with 2-deoxycytosine in a base 
 pair ; therefore  the product - forming steps of the reaction are determined 
 by the radical cation intermediate . as shown in scheme 2  dg could couple 
 with radicals ( e.g.  o2 ) to 
 ultimately yield dz  while dg reacts with nucleophiles ( e.g.  h2o and nh3 ) at c8  ultimately yielding a spirocyclic product 
 after completion of the four - electron oxidation . 
 thus  the yield of 8-dsi was anticipated to be greatest in the duplex context  
 as indeed it is . 
 furthermore  these results support the original hypothesis 
 by steenken that the duplex context would favor the radical cation 
 nature of one - electron oxidized dg  which is still the focus of many current research efforts . because of the limitation imposed by the inability to detect the 
 bis - ammonium adduct  or to understand its decomposition pathway  
 any 
 comparison between the ammonia adduct distributions would be based 
 on poorly defined assumptions ; consequently  further discussion of 
 these results is not provided . for the last set of studies  
 we were inspired by the observation 
 that the a ring of dsp mimics the h - bonding pattern of 
 thymidine  while the a ring of 5-dsi mimics the h - bonding 
 pattern of 2-deoxycytidine ( figure 6 ) . on the basis of this observation  polymerase insertion assays 
 opposite dsp vs 5-dsi 
 were conducted to 
 determine if these h - bonding schemes applied during the selection 
 of a nucleotide to insert opposite these spirocycles . comparison of h - bonding 
 patterns between dsp vs t and 5-dsi vs dc . 
 site - specific synthesis of dsp or 5-dsi was achieved by synthesizing dog into an odn by solid - phase 
 synthesis and then oxidizing this strand with or without nh4cl present with the one - electron oxidant na2ircl6 to furnish the desired products . upon ion - exchange hplc purification  
 the absolute stereochemical 
 assignments for the dsp isomers have been established 
 for the odns  and those for 5-dsi are assigned in this work to be analogous based on the mechanism 
 of deamination discussed above ( see figure s7  supporting information  for more details ) . 
 standing start 
 polymerase studies were conducted while providing the enzyme only 
 one type of nucleotide per reaction . on the basis of previous studies  
 insertion of dttp opposite dsp 
 was not observed ; therefore  to ensure that only one nucleotide 
 was inserted opposite the lesion  and no extension past the lesions 
 occurs  the sequence had an a placed 5 to the spirocycle ( figure 7 ) . 
 klenow fragment exo- was selected as the polymerase  
 and after the extension reactions  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
 ( page ) was conducted to determine the amount of datp  dttp  dgtp  
 or dctp incorporated opposite the dsp or 5-dsi diastereomers . 
 the polymerase did not select either pyrimidine for 
 insertion opposite the two lesions ( figure s7  supporting information ) ; thus  only data for purine insertion 
 opposite the lesions is provided in figure 7 . with respect to insertion 
 opposite the dsp diastereomers  ( r)-dsp was observed 
 to give a slight preference for insertion of datp opposite  and ( s)-dsp gave nearly 
 equal insertion of datp and dgtp . in comparison to the dsp results 
  the 5-dsi isomers showed that ( s)-5-dsi gives similar 
 amounts of datp and dgtp insertion  while ( r)-5-dsi yields a slight preference 
 for datp insertion . 
 unfortunately  these results do not support the 
 hypothesis that h - bonding in the a ring of the spirocycle is the key 
 parameter for nucleotide selection  but do show that stereochemistry 
 may be important for selecting a base pairing partner by this polymerase . sequence 
 studied for polymerase dntp insertion studies and the 
 percent dntp insertions opposite the diastereomers of dsp and 5-dsi . 
 ( a ) sequence for the dsodn construct used 
 in the polymerase insertion assays and ( b ) comparison of the percent 
 purine dntp insertion opposite the lesions dsp and 5-dsi by the dna polymerase klenow fragment exo- . 
 the present studies mapped 
 the pathways and quantified the products 
 observed when dg was allowed to react with nh4cl in the presence of the photooxidants riboflavin and rose bengal  
 as well as the one - electron oxidant na2ircl6 . 
 on the basis of the analysis of the products in the nucleoside 
 context  the major products were oxidant dependent . 
 the major product 
 for riboflavin was dz  rose bengal yielded the 5-dsi diastereomers  and na2ircl6 gave 
 the dsp diastereomers as the major products ( figure 3 ) . 
 further analyses determined that 5-dsi and 8-dsi decompose via an acid - catalyzed deamination pathway leading to dsp as an end product ( scheme 5 ) . 
 oxidations 
 of dg in the nucleoside  ss- and dsodn contexts with 
 photochemically activated riboflavin demonstrated three major context 
 effects : ( 1 ) the yield of dz was highest in the nucleoside 
 studies and decreased dramatically in dsodn contexts ; ( 2 ) when nh3 participated as the nucleophile  5-dsi was obtained 
 in the highest yield in nucleoside studies  while the yield of 8-dsi was highest in dsodn contexts ; and ( 3 ) when h2o was the nucleophile in nucleoside reactions  dsp presented 
 in the highest yield  while in dsodn contexts dgh was 
 obtained in the highest yield ( figure 4 ) . furthermore  
 a combination of mapping the decomposition pathways of the dsi compounds to dsp  in which the absolute configuration 
 has been assigned  allowed the determination of the absolute configurations 
 for the diastereomers of 5- and 8-dsi . 
 these studies provide fundamental chemical insight 
 into formation of amine adducts to dg and their stability . 
 further  these studies insert a cautionary note to researchers who 
 purify their odns using ammonium salts and then conduct oxidation 
 reactions after purification . 
 ammonia is a better nucleophile and 
 out - competes water for the electrophilic intermediates derived from dg or dog oxidation  resulting in a new mass 
 of dg + 31 or dog + 15  respectively . 
 a similar observation has been highlighted for 
 oxidations occurring in tris buffer that generate tris adducts to dg . 
 oxidations were conducted 
 with 2-deoxyguanosine ( dg ) at 1 mm concentration 
 in 75 mm napi buffer ( ph 7.4 ) and 22 c . 
 reactions 
 with 20 mm nh4cl and without this salt allowed product 
 profile comparisons . 
 the oxidants and specific reaction conditions 
 were achieved as follows : ( 1 ) riboflavin oxidations were initiated 
 by adding 200 m riboflavin while exposing the samples to 350 
 nm light for 3 h. ( 2 ) rose bengal oxidations were achieved by adding 
 100 m rose bengal and exposing these samples to 350 nm for 
 3 h. the light source for the riboflavin and rose bengal reactions 
 came from a sun lamp that was placed 7 cm above the reaction 
 eppendorf tubes . 
 the tube lids were left open to allow all wavelengths 
 of light to pass into the reaction samples . 
 ( 3 ) the na2ircl6 oxidations were initiated by a bolus addition of 
 the oxidizing salt with a final concentration of 10 mm  after a 30 
 min reaction the samples were quenched with 50 mm edta ( ph 8) . 
 the 
 reaction products and their distributions were determined by a dual 
 hplc method following a previously reported set of protocols ( specific 
 details can be found in the supporting information file ) . the first rp - hplc run allowed 
 analysis of dog and 8-amino - dg ( both observed 
 in < 1% yield )  while all other products eluted in the void volume 
 of this run . 
 the void volume was collected  dried  and reinjected 
 on a hypercarb hplc column to analyze the diastereomers of dgh  dsp  5-dsi  and 8-dsi  as 
 well as the product dz  while monitoring their absorbance 
 at 240 nm . to determine product distributions the peak areas were 
 integrated and normalized by each compound s 240 nm ( values provided below ) . 
 esi - ms  and then each compound 
 was hplc purified for further structural analysis . 
 the dgh diastereomers were previously characterized by nmr  dz was also previously characterized by nmr  and the dsp diastereomers have 
 been characterized by x - ray crystallography . 
 structural characterization of 5-dsi and 8-dsi by nmr was not conducted because of the instability of these compounds 
 toward deaminating to dsp  and the lack of nonexchangeable 
 protons on the ring of either ammonia adducts makes them very challenging 
 for structural analysis . 
 furthermore  if deamination of either 5-dsi or 8-dsi to dsp occurs in 
 the nmr tube during analysis  the peaks observed would be similar 
 and challenging to interpret ; therefore  the best method for obtaining 
 structural data on the diastereomers of 5-dsi and 8-dsi is via the esi - ms / ms that was conducted 
 ( figure 2 )  and provided satisfactory results 
 to determine their structures .

 the odns were hplc purified 
 using an ion - exchange hplc column  and the purification salts ( naoac ) 
 were removed by dialysis prior to their oxidation following previously 
 reported methods . 
 the riboflavin oxidations 
 were conducted similarly to those reported for the nucleoside studies  
 with the following exceptions : the ssodn oxidations were conducted 
 on 20 m samples while the dsodn oxidations were conducted on 
 10 m samples . in addition  the reaction times were decreased 
 for the odn reactions to 30 min . 
 after the oxidations  the odns were 
 digested with a suite of nucleases and phosphatases to nucleoside 
 samples following a previously established protocol  with the exception that all buffers during the digestion 
 process were comprised of ammonium salts . 
 next  the digested mixture 
 was analyzed by the hplc method used in the nucleoside studies . 
 the polymerase 
 insertion assays were conducted on duplex odn samples that had site 
 specific incorporation of dsp or 5-dsi in 
 the template strand . 
 the site - specific synthesis was commenced on 
 odns that had a dog phosphoramidite synthesized at the 
 desired site of modification within the sequence 5-cgt tax ggc gca act gga aa-3 where x = dog . 
 the modifications 
 were synthesized by taking 1 nmol of the dog - containing 
 odn and placing it in 100 l of reaction buffer ( 75 mm napi  ph 7.4 ) with or without 2 mm nh4cl . the reaction 
 without nh4cl gave the dsp diastereomers and 
 the reaction with nh4cl gave the 5-dsi diastereomers . 
 the individual diastereomers were purified using an ion - exchange hplc 
 column running naoac as the resolving salt and characterized via digestion 
 of the odn to nucleosides followed by hplc analysis ( purification 
 details can be found in the supporting information ) .

 20 l of the annealed duplex was added  1 l of klenow 
 fragment exo- ( 0.2 units/l )  0.5 l of dntp ( 500 m 
 stock solution )  and 8.5 l of klenow buffer to obtain a 100 
 nm duplex solution with 10 m dntp and 0.2 u of polymerase . 
 the reaction was incubated at 
 37 c for 30 min  after which loading dye ( 95% dmf plus 0.025% 
 bromophenol blue  and 0.025% xylene cylanol ) was added to the samples 
 and they were heated at 95 c for 20 min to quench the reaction 
 and denature the dna 
 the denatured samples 
 were loaded on a 20% page gel and electrophoresed for 2 h at 45 w. 
 upon completion of the electrophoresis  the gel was placed in a phosphor

1) Abstract: The study examines the product profiles generated from the oxidation of 2-deoxyguanosine, mapping the reactions with different nucleophiles in the presence of various photooxidants. The products identified include spiroiminodihydantoin, 5-guanidinohydantoin, and oxazolone resulting from h2o as the nucleophile.

2) Research and Discussion: The study focused on understanding the reactions and reactivities of the initial electrophilic intermediate of 2-deoxyguanosine upon oxidation with different nucleophiles. The resulting products, including spiroiminodihydantoin and 5-guanidinohydantoin, were characterized and analyzed, and their mechanism of formation was proposed based on quantification in different contexts.

3) Results and Conclusion: The study found that when ammonia is present as the nucleophile, a range of diastereotopic constitutional isomers are formed, while water leads to the formation of spiroiminodihydantoin, 5-guanidinohydantoin, and oxazolone. The presence of ammonium salts before oxidation may lead to unwanted side reactions involving ammonia. These findings provide valuable insights into the reactivity of 2-deoxyguanosine and caution against the use of ammonium salts in oligonucleotide purification before oxidation."

"agriculture has been one of the primary economic avenues in the philippines contributing to about 20% to the gross domestic product ( gdp ) . 
 crops comprise about 47.56% of the total agricultural sector and have contributed to about 510 billion pesos ( p510b ) to the country 's national income . 
 benguet is a province in the northern portion of the philippines belonging to the cordillera administrative region . 
 there are about 27.5 thousand farms covering 30 thousand hectares of agricultural land in benguet . 
 it   is also the largest producer of vegetables and fruits  supplying the capital cities in the philippines . 
 the province is known as the  salad bowl  of the philippines as its major crops are tubers  roots    bulbs     leafy vegetables  stems  and flowers . in 2005  benguet was the top producer of brocolli and carrots producing about 1.2 thousand and 13.7 metric tons contributing to 87.4% and 81.4%    respectively  to the national output . however  growing vegetables is considered a risk occupation in some areas in developing countries . 
 soogarun et al .   in 2003   found significantly low / abnormal mean blood cholinesterase levels among vegetable growers in thailand . 
 health impacts of pesticide misuse on the other hand greatly affect the farming communities in the philippines questioning the economic advantages of its use . 
 many researchers have correlated the extent of direct and indirect pesticide exposure and health hazards such as increased mortality  dermal contamination  depression in cholinesterase level  fetal abnormalities  and spontaneous abortion among pregnant women [ 36 ] . 
 it is a discouraging fact though  that with knowledge of health risks  many filipino families still perceive that crop yield outweighs the health risks associated with pesticide use . 
 pesticide poisoning is one of the most prevalent health problems in the philippines . in a study by the department of   health ( doh ) from 19911995  organophosphates accounted for the highest number of poisoning cases while organochlorines caused the most number of deaths . 
 cheng in 1994   studied 2000 benguet vegetable farmers and found that the most common complaints were allergic reactions both in the skin and the eyes  abdominal pain  dizziness  chest pain  headache  and nose bleed . 
 meanwhile  a study on pesticide poisoning in selected hospitals in four philippines regions in 2001 found that cases of acute poisoning were more prevalent than chronic cases . 
 this study aimed to identify the pesticide exposure and risk factors among vegetable farmers .   the data can be used as   baseline data on the vegetable industry in the philippines . 
 this was a cross - sectional study to investigate the prevalence of pesticide exposure and its risk factors . 
 target population consisted of vegetable farmers in the largest vegetable producing community in the philippines . 
 the inclusion criteria were farmers living in the community for at   least one year from the time of interview  and   practicing farmers who own or work a farm in the community . 
 those who were involved in organic farming and the migrant farmers who have been in the area for less than one year were excluded . 
 there were 211 respondents from the identified municipalities selected as   the study population using cluster sampling . 
 the sampling size calculated with   p = .05 was 211 vegetable farmers and 37 farms . 
 data gathering was done using the following : ( 1 ) questionnaire  structured personal interview with farm workers / farmers was done by research assistants who were trained prior to the data collection . 
 details included personal information  health history  pesticide usage  work practices  work conditions  risk factors associated with pesticide exposure  and health data ; ( 2 ) exposure assessment monitoring on work conditions  work practices  and pesticide concentration ;    ( 3 ) work analysis in each farm was also done to validate work practices related to pesticide preparation and application . 
 recall bias was dealt with by confining the health data questionnaire to the last one year from the time of interview . 
 the health data were also collected by medical doctors who simultaneously conducted physical assessment of the farmers . 
 this project study was collaborated with the local agencies coordinating with farmers in the vegetable industry in benguet . 
 ethical clearance was given by the research  information and dissemination office of the proponent 's institute . 
 the study included 127 males ( 60.2% ) and 84 females ( 39.8% ) with ages ranging from 16 to 72 ( mean = 45  12 ) showing a   relatively adult population . 
 seventy one percent ( 71% ) were married and majority were working as agricultural workers ( 82% )  and the remaining were pesticide applicators  mixers  and loaders ( 18% ) . 
 the respondents were living in their present address for an average of 34.76 years ( sd =   16.72 ) with a mean distance of 3163 meters ( sd = 36539.13 ) from the vegetable plantation or farm . 
 few farmers reported history of smoking ( 16.2% )  and 7% claimed they smoked and 2% had a history of chewing tobacco . 
 the average number of cigarettes and tobacco consumed in a week were 12 sticks and    < 1 tobacco  respectively . 
 the farmers used pesticides in their farms in an average of 1.9 days per week . 
 the mean total application time was 3.47 hours ( mean = 3.47  2.09 ) . 
 the mean amount of pesticide used in an application was 21.35 l per application ( mean 21.35  48.17 ) . 
 the farmers also reported that in an average year  there were 2.3 ( mean = 2.3  0.53 ) cropping seasons with a mean of 3.84   ( mean = 2.3  0.53 ) months per cropping season   ( table 1 ) . 
 44.5% reported that they wiped their sweat with a contaminated piece of fabric  41.7% re - entered recently sprayed area  37.4% had exposure because of damaged backpack sprayer  and 31.8% were exposed when they sprayed against the wind ( table 2 ) . 
 however  further analysis shows that they did not frequently use such equipment nor had adequate gear to fully protect themselves . 
 the same pattern was seen among all kinds of personal protective equipment ( ppe ) with the exception of boots which was frequently used by 77.5% of farmers . 
 94% said that they have worked with or used pesticides in their lifetime  and 16.4% from this population used pesticides in their own households . 
 the vegetables commonly grown in the area were potatoes ( 67.4% )  cabbage ( 63.7% )  and carrots ( 36.8% ) . majority ( 87% ) 
 the most common route of pesticide entry in the study was respiratory ( 68.9% ) followed by dermal and ocular entry ( 60.5% and 38%  resp . ) . 
 sumicidine   was the most commonly used pyrethroid which contains fenvalerate as its active ingredient . 
 table 3 shows that 37% and almost 14.7% of the study population used pesticides with active ingredients of fenvalerate and cypermethrin  respectively . 
 although pyrethroid was the most frequently used pesticide  it is organophosphate that consisted the largest amount of exposure among farmers at 210.02 liters  followed by pyrethorid at 151.4 liters  and carbamates at 32.16 liters for the entire one year . 
 the pesticide exposure of the farmers measured in table 4 as dependent variable was related to   the amount of pesticide used in liters  frequency of use and duration of use . 
 all the independent variables  except amount and years   of pesticide use were categorical variables . 
 those who used more pesticides over a longer period of time had higher total pesticide exposure . 
 furthermore  a farmer who was a pesticide applicator  mixer  loader and who wiped sweat with contaminated piece of fabric  and who had not been given instructions through training   association was at risk of having higher pesticide exposure . 
 seventy four percent ( 74% ) of the respondents became ill because of work   for the last 12 months preceding the study . 
 the most common symptoms were headache ( 64.1% )  muscle pain ( 61.1% )  cough ( 45.5% )  weakness ( 42.4% )    eye pain ( 39.9% )  chest pain ( 37.4% )  and eye redness ( 33.8% ) . 
 a subsequent study is recommended to focus on adverse health effects of these farmers and   association with certain risk factors . 
 the results of this study identified pesticide exposure and farming practices of farmers in the largest vegetable producing area in the philippines . 
 this has also been documented in other countries . in the study of coble et al . in 2005  and thompson et al . in 2003  
 unsafe practices like re - entry of recently spayed area  use of damaged backpack sprayer and wiping sweat with a contaminated piece of fabric were identified in this study . 
 re - entering a recently sprayed area  as mentioned in the study of tielemans et al .   in 1999   is an important determinant of dermal exposure to specific chemicals such as captan and tolylfluanid . 
 a pesticide 's formulation is a significant factor for human exposure  with greater risks present among aqueous and emulsifiable concentrates because it impairs the protective function of chemically protective gloves . according to wolfe   in 1993  pesticides may react through chemical and biotic processes . 
 however  pesticides may undergo activation processes unexpectedly and may be broken down to equally or more potent and mobile toxic compounds posing a greater threat to nontarget organisms . 
 it is then advised to limit or decrease the frequency or duration of staying in the contaminated crops right after pesticide application . 
 organophosphates  carbamates and pyrethroid pesticides were the most commonly used type of pesticides among the farmers in this study . 
 the same was seen in the study of   clarke et al .   in 1997   in ghanna where organophosphates consisted of the most commonly used pesticides followed by carbamates and organochlorines . 
 the same trend was seen among farmers in sri lanka and in brazil [ 15  16 ] . 
 the farmers in this study used pesticides in their farms with a mean application time of 3.47 hours ( mean = 3.47  2.09 ) . 
 the mean amount of pesticide used in an application was 21.35 liters per application ( mean 21.35  48.17 ) . 
 the number of spray operations per week has been proven to have significant association with the likelihood of experiencing neurobehavioral  respiratory  or intestinal symptoms in a study among indonesian farmers . in a study among north carolina growers and agents    it was found that the study population   perceived that once the pesticide is diluted and reentry intervals are observed  the risk it poses becomes diminished . 
 sumicidine  which was the most commonly used pesticides among the benguet farmers contains fenvalerate . 
 fenvalerate induces numbness  itching  tingling  and burning sensations in exposed workers that developed after a latent period of approximately 30 minutes  peaked by 8 hours  and disappeared within 24 hours . 
 additional data among chinese workers   demonstrated that fenvalerate decreased the semen quality of occupational workers . on the other hand  other active ingredients like cypermethrin  mancozeb  and 
 skin sensations were reported to occur among field workers and usually lasted only for a few hours and did not persist for more than one day after exposure to cypermethrin . 
 for mancozeb  prolonged low - level exposure to mancozeb affected several aspects of immune functioning   and moderate association existed between mancozeb and neural tube defects . 
 most often  gloves were the most commonly used personal protective equipment because the hands were the most exposed areas [ 23  24 ] . 
 many circumstances contributed to nonadherence to proper use of ppe like extreme heat during pesticide application  uncomfortable to use  few resources to afford new ppe  peer - related factors  and increasing age [ 18  2527 ] . 
 the study also showed certain risk factors associated with pesticide exposure such as re - entering recently sprayed area  spraying against the wind  use of damaged backpack sprayer  spills on the back  spills while mixing pesticides  among others . aside from direct pesticide use  the different agricultural tasks mentioned above may also contribute as risk factors to pesticide exposure . 
 re - entering a recently sprayed area  as mentioned in the study of tielemans et al . in 1999   is an important determinant of dermal exposure to specific chemicals such as captan and tolylfluanid . 
 there is evidence that weight loss could be a possible health effect of chronic pesticide poisoning . 
 decreased body mean mass accompanied by reduced cholinesterase activities among seven farm workers was documented . 
 also  kackar et al . in 1999   found that when rats were administered orally with mancozeb ( ethylenebisdithiocarbamate )  dose - dependent signs of poisoning  weight loss    and mortality developed . 
 senthilselvan et al . found a significant association between carbamate exposure and prevalence of asthma among those non - asthmatic farmers and lower mean lung function variables among those with asthma . 
 this study has shown the pesticide exposure of farmers in the largest vegetable producing area in the philippines . 
 it is vital that a sequential exposure assessment be done in order to come up with a correlation study between pesticide exposure and health problems . 
 the study showed that pesticide use is prevalent among farmers in benguet which is the largest vegetable producer in the philippines . 
 it is also suggested that chronic effects of pesticide cited in certain studies [ 31  32 ] such as carcinogenic effects  poor reproductive outcomes  neurologic and respiratory disorders  impairments of the immune system and birth defects should also be investigated in future studies . 
 this manuscript adds to existing literature on pesticide exposure in the philippines which are so far mainly descriptive in nature . 
 this paper also identifies risk factors such as work practices and designs of containers / sprayers that may increase pesticide exposure among farmers . 
 this also calls for a local level policy research for program intervention among vegetable farmers using pesticides .","

Abstract:

This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate pesticide exposure and its risk factors among vegetable farmers. A sample of 211 farmers and 37 farms were selected through cluster sampling, with a mean pesticide usage of 21.35 liters. Risk factors identified included damaged backpack sprayers, spills on hands, and spraying against the wind. The top three pesticides used were pyrethroid, organophosphates, and carbamates. Those exposed to fungicides and insecticides had higher total pesticide exposure. The most prevalent symptoms were headache, muscle pain, cough, weakness, eye pain, chest pain, and eye redness. This data can inform the development of safety and health programs in the vegetable industry.

Research and Discussion:
The study revealed that damaged backpack sprayers, spills on hands, and spraying against the wind were significant risk factors for pesticide exposure. Pyrethroid, organophosphates, and carbamates were the most commonly used pesticides in the targeted vegetable farms. Those who had direct contact with pesticides through their work, such as applicators, mixers, and loaders, had higher exposure. Lack of training on proper pesticide handling also increased the risk of exposure. The prevalence of symptoms, including headache and muscle pain, highlights the health consequences of pesticide exposure in this population.

Results and Conclusion:
The data from this cross-sectional study shows a high prevalence of pesticide exposure and related health symptoms among vegetable farmers. This highlights the need for effective safety and health programs in the vegetable industry. Measures to reduce pesticide exposure, such as proper handling and use of personal protective equipment, should be implemented. Training for farmers on safe pesticide handling practices is also crucial. Further research could explore the long-term effects of pesticide exposure on the health of vegetable farmers."
"evans  using a mouse mutant for the lim homeodomain transcription factor ( islet1  isl1 )  demonstrated that an isl1 positive ( isl1 + ) population is localised in the secondary heart field ( shf )  contributing to the outflow tract  right ventricle  atria and ( to a small extent ) the left ventricle . 
 isl1 is considered a marker of shf cells that contribute to the venous and arterial poles of the cardiac tube  while the other cells from the shf contribute only to the arterial pole . 
 the shf or anterior heat field ( ahf ) was identified as a splanchnic mesoderm underlying the caudal pharynx  which provides myocardium to the outflow tract during tube looping . in 2005  
 the same research group also identified isl1+/c - kit negative ( c - kit-)/stem cell antigen-1 negative ( sca-1- ) progenitors in the postnatal heart  demonstrating that these cells persist after birth and that these organ - specific progenitor cells may be isolated  purified  expanded and differentiated into mature cardiac myocytes for future cardiac applications . 
 our research group identified isl1 + cells during gestation until the postnatal age  and demonstrated the contemporary expression of isl1 and c - kit in the interstitial cells in the ventricular myocardium in human foetal and postnatal hearts . 
 this paper demonstrated  by confocal analysis  that all isl1 + cells were also c - kit+  while c - kit+ cells were not necessarily isl1 +  as if isl1 + cells were a subpopulation of c - kit+ cells . 
 it has been supposed that there may be a primordial cardiovascular precursor in the shf that expresses the three markers isl1  nkx2.5 and fetal liver kinase 1 ( flk1 ) and can generate three lineages : cardiac muscle  smooth muscle and endothelium . 
 the shf cooperates with the first heart field ( fhf ) and the cardiac neural crest cells during the development of the vertebrate heart . 
 the fhf lineage forms the early cardiac tube and generates the left ventricle  while the shf contributes additional cells to the maturing heart and  along with the cardiac neural crest cells  generates the outflow tract vessels and valves . 
 the presence of cardiovascular progenitor cells positive for isl1 and/or nkx2.5 in the shf has been well confirmed by a recent work published in science . 
 the authors suggested that there are two distinct populations  one for the shf and the other for the fhf ; the first population is clearly positive for isl1 and expresses mirna 199a / b  while the second has no distinct markers and expresses mirna 200a / b . 
 progenitor cells of the shf depend on the cardiac specific transcription factors isl1 and nkx2.5  which play a key role at an early stage of cardiac progenitor formation . 
 their expression is regulated by wnt / beta - catenin signalling  which in turn also regulates bmp4 signalling . 
 this last signalling pathway activates gata4 and srf . despite the key role of isl1  
 this transcription factor is not considered an indubitable marker of this subpopulation of shf progenitor cells . 
 it has been demonstrated very recently that isl1 labels both shf precursors and some cardiac neural crest cells and that mef2c is a more efficient marker of the shf progenitor cells in labelling experiments . 
 this paper indirectly suggests both a review of past literature in view of these new data and using a different marker in studies of the shf progenitor cells . 
 moreover  considering heart development in different species  such as chicken  mouse and xenopus  it appears that isl1 is expressed in a common cardiac cell population that splits into fhf and shf lineages during heart development and that this common progenitor also contributes cells to the cardiovascular system . 
 anversa s research group described rat cardiac stem cells for the first time  many research groups have claimed to have discovered new and important cardiac progenitor / stem cells in the adult heart .. since 2005  the scientific community talked about adult c - kit+ and/or sca-1 + and/or mdr-1 + cells  and embryonic isl1 + cells . 
 these two populations have always been considered different entities and are described separately in many research papers and reviews  although expression of the isl1 transcription factor by cardiac precursor cells has also been reported in adult hearts . 
 di nardo  described for the first time the concomitant expression of the three markers  i.e.  c - kit  sca-1 and isl1  in the same cardiac precursor cell . prof . 
 di nardo s research group described the concomitant expression of the isl1  c - kit and sca-1 markers in adult mouse cardiac progenitor cells in 2008  while in 2009 our research group confirmed the expression of the three markers in adult rat cpcs . in a systematic work published in 2011 about the identification of isl1 + cells in the mouse heart from postnatal day 1 to young adulthood in different strains  the authors found clusters of positive cells in the cardiac ganglia of the studied strains  while found very a few clusters of isl1 + cardiac precursors only in 129svj or balb / c strains and in animals not older than 4 months . 
 recently genead et al . demonstrated the contemporary expression of c - kit and isl1 markers in rat adult hearts in normal  pregnant and infarcted individuals . 
 they reported the expression of both markers in the entire heart and in the right ventricle  the left ventricle  the outflow tract and the peri - infarct and peri - ischemia regions . 
 unfortunately  the study was based on real - time pcr analysis  and whenever immunocytochemistry was shown  no double staining for both markers had been performed . other evidence supports the hypothesis that isl1 + cells are not a different population from sca-1 + cpcs . 
 the contemporary expression of sca-1 and isl1 has been described both in a subpopulation of sca-1+/c - kit- cells identified and isolated from adult mouse hearts and in sca-1 + cardiosphere - derived cells obtained from cardiac explants from normal  sham - operated or post - myocardial infarct hearts . in this study  only sca-1+/cd45- cells were also positive for isl1 and increased in number only after an acute myocardial infarct . considering that other authors identified isl1 + cells in adult murine and rat hearts  weinberger et al . used heterozygous isl1-lacz mice  a more sensitive genetic approach  to investigate the presence and localisation of these precursor cells in 30 animals at different time points after birth ( 10 weeks to 18 months ) . 
 they found four different populations of isl1 + cells : i ) clusters of isl1 + neurons were found in the cardiac parasympathetic ganglia of the posterior side of the heart and in the nervous plexus surrounding the pulmonary veins ; ii ) clusters of isl1 + smooth muscle cells were found in the muscular layer above the aortic and pulmonary valve in the proximal part of the aorta and the trunk of the pulmonary artery ( only a few positive cells were present in the aortic valve leaflets ) ; iii ) clusters of isl1 + cardiomyocytes were found in the left ventricular outflow tract region ; iv ) clusters of isl1 + sinoatrial node ( san ) cells were found in the muscular wall between right atrium and vena cava superior . 
 these results support the hypothesis that in the adult heart many cell populations may derive from isl1 + embryonic precursors  as smooth muscle cells  parasympathetic neurons  san cells  but also that  even if reduced in number  isl1 + cardiomyogenic progenitors  may be present in the adult myocardium . 
 many papers have been published on cpcs  and many research groups claimed to have discovered different populations of progenitor cells . 
 it is strange to think that the cardiac tissue possesses a larger number of stem / progenitor cells compared to the other tissues found in our body  and it is hopeful that cpcs may vary in number with external stimuli or with age as it happens for other adult stem cells . 
 the hypothesis that the myocardium is a non - regenerative tissue is not valid anymore  and much evidence supports the new idea that there is at least one cardiac progenitor cell . isl1 + and c - kit+/sca-1 + cells were considered to be two different populations until 2012  when prof . 
 sussmann  citing our recent paper published in the european journal of histochemistry in an editorial in circulation research  suggested considering the possibility of studying a population of cells positive for both isl1 and c - kit instead of choosing to study only one side of the coin . in the review and in the research paper published in 2009  we reported the concomitant expression of isl1  c - kit and sca-1 in a population of cpcs isolated without any sorting or selection and suggested for the first time that there could be a unique population of cells with several subpopulations and that the several markers identified could be only the effect of different cultivation conditions in the different laboratories . 
 other research groups later described the co - expression of isl1  sca-1 and/or c - kit and we further demonstrated that  in samples from foetal and postnatal human hearts  there was also an isl1 + subpopulation of c - kit+ cells . 
 anversa among the authors  on a study of the presence of c - kit+ cardiac stem cells in embryonic  foetal and neonatal mouse hearts . 
 they demonstrated that these cells can form cardiomyocytes and coronary vessels and  as we have demonstrated in our paper  they are more abundant than isl1 + cells . moreover  they stated that isl1 + cells are present only in the outflow tract  atria and part of the right ventricle and that they are a population of committed cells derived from an immature primitive cell . 
 we can say that there is strong evidence suggesting that c - kit  sca-1 and isl1 may be markers of subpopulations of cpcs that are present in the embryonic  foetal and neonatal heart and persist from after birth until adulthood . 
 the identification of the real immature cardiac precursor expressing the four cell markers ( c - kit  sca-1  mdr-1 and isl1 ) and above all the identification of a unique isolation protocol is very important in the clinical practice . 
 this immature common cardiac precursor may represent the perfect candidate for cardiac tissue engineering and  hopefully  may be driven pharmacologically to one phenotype or the other . to identify a standardised protocol 
 is extremely important to go further in the studies on cardiac tissue regeneration  and common guidelines are needed in cardiac stem cell therapy . 
 the isolation of stem cells by cell sorting or immunobead selection using surface markers such as c - kit  sca-1 or mdr-1 is important to identify a standardised protocol of isolation  however isl1 may be useful in basic research to follow the fate of cpcs in heart development and myocardium differentiation . 
 moreover  it is extremely important to understand which is the predominant precursor population in the different stages of life and which population should be used in a paediatric patient instead of an adult one . 
 if fate of immature cardiac precursors may be determined pharmacologically  the possibility to regenerate san cells is very important in curing arrhythmia s both in patients with ischemia and malformations . 
 the identification of the different subpopulations in the developing heart may be a fundamental step in identifying the optimal cell line for cell - based therapies .","

1) Abstract: Cardiac progenitor cells have been isolated from both embryonic and adult hearts and have the potential to differentiate into multiple cell types. Recent studies suggest a connection between two distinct populations of these cells, which may have a common origin. Clarifying this concept is crucial for their use in cardiac tissue engineering.

2) Research and Discussion: The origin of cardiac progenitor cells is still uncertain, but they may originate from the first and secondary heart fields and the neural crest. Two separate populations, Islet1 and c-kit+/sca-1+, have been identified. However, new evidence suggests they may be subpopulations of a single pool of cardiac stem cells derived from a common precursor.

3) Results and Conclusion: Understanding the connection between cardiac progenitor cell populations is vital for their effective application in cardiac tissue engineering. The two populations, Islet1 and c-kit+/sca-1+, may represent varying stages of a single pool of cardiac stem cells. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the potential of these cells in cardiac regeneration."
"primary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis ( pdlg ) is a rare neoplasm with a short survival time of a few months . 
 we report on a 53-year - old male patient who presented with epileptic seizures  gait disturbance  paraparesis and sensory deficits in the dermatomes t8 - 10 . 
 magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) revealing numerous spinal and cranial gadolinium - enhancing nodules in the meninges and histopathology led us to diagnose primary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis with who grade iii astrocytic cells . 
 consecutively  the patient underwent craniospinal radiotherapy ( 30 gy ) and 11 sequential cycles of temozolomide . 
 thirteen months later  spinal mri revealed tumor progression . second - line chemotherapy with 5 cycles of irinotecan and bevacizumab did not prevent further clinical deterioration . 
 the patient died twenty - two months after diagnosis  being the longest survival time described thus far with respect to pdlg consisting of astrocytic tumor cells . 
 radiochemotherapy including temozolomide  as established standard therapy for brain malignant astrocytomas  might be valid as a basic therapeutic strategy for this pdlg subtype . 
 primary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis ( pdlg ) is diagnosed when a glioma is located in the subarachnoid space  while intraparenchymal tumor lesions are absent . 
 pdlg must be distinguished from secondary meningeal gliomatosis resulting from a primary gliomatous cns tumor . 
 pdlg  especially when caused by malignant astrocytic cells  is associated with very poor survival . 
 we describe a patient with pdlg consisting of malignant astrocytic cells who underwent combined radio- and chemotherapy leading to the longest survival time described in the literature thus far . 
 a 53-year - old man was referred to the dept . of neurology due to a generalized epileptic seizure and 
 five months later he presented with bilateral sensory deficits at dermatome levels t8 - 10  paraparesis and gait disturbance . 
 cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) analysis revealed a high cell count ( 300/3 cells/l ; reference range : 5/3 cells/l ) with atypical cells that could not be further characterized . 
 t1-weighted images ( t1-wi ) revealed spinal and cranial gd - enhancing nodules in the leptomeninges ( figures 1a - e ) and on t2-weighted images ( t2-wi ) an intramedullary edema ( figure 1c ) . 
 note gd - enhanced supra- and in - fratentorial meningeal thickenings of the brain in sagittal t1-w image ( a ) . 
 prior to ra - diochemotherapy  t1-wi reveals lep - tomeningeal gd - enhancement ( b ) and t2-wi shows edema of the myelon on levels c7  t1 - 2 and t5 - 6 due to minor tumor extensions in the adjacent spinal cord ( c ) . 
 following radiochemotherapy  t1-wi displays reduced leptomeningeal gd - enhancement ( d ) while t2-wi shows less myelon spinal edema on those levels ( e ) . 
 three weeks later  intradural biopsy from a gd - enhancing nodule at l2 - 3 level revealed fibrously - thickened meninges infiltrated by malignant astrocytic tumor cells ( figures 2a - c ) . 
 the tumor was categorized as primary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis ( pdlg ) confirmed by the reference center for brain tumors in dsseldorf  germany . 
 intradural lumbar biopsy displays fibrously - thickened lep - tomeninges infiltrated by pleomorphic neoplastic astrocytic cells ( a ) . 
 the astrocytic tumor cells reveal intensive intracytoplasmic staining with anti - glial fibrillary astrocytic protein . 
 ki67 ( mib-1 ) staining reveals a high proliferation index of up to 20% ( c ) . 
 prior to radiotherapy of the craniospinal axis ( 4  2.5 gy / week  total dose : 30 gy )  the patient underwent 3 cycles of temozolomide ( tmz ) ( cycle 1 : 150 - 200 mg / mtzm  d1 - 5  q28d ) . on re - staging 
  spinal t1-weighted images showed tumor - lesion regression on l5 and spinal t2-wi images demonstrated spinal - edema regression ( compare figures 1c - d with figures 1a - b ) . 
 three weeks after the completion of radiotherapy the patient received eight additional cycles of tmz ( 200 mg / mtzm  d1 - 5  q28d )  during which meningeal thickening of the brain regressed . 
 however  spinal mri thirteen months after starting tmz therapy revealed meningeal tumor progression at the lesions on spinal levels c1 - 2  c7-t2 and t5 - 8 . 
 five cycles of second - line chemotherapy with irinotecan and bevacizumab failed to halt further clinical deterioration . 
 the patient died twenty - two months after the diagnosis of pdlg and exhibited until dead an encouraging karnovsky performance status of 60% . 
 the diagnosis of pdlg is usually established by autopsy but rarely diagnosed prior to death . 
 pdlg of the oligodendroglial and that of the well - differentiated astrocytic tumor type are associated with a considerably longer median survival time than that of the malignant astrocytic tumor type . 
 pdlg was diagnosed in the aforementioned case  as we observed on histopathology leptomeningeally - encapsulated malignant astrocytic cells without primary attachment to the spinal cord or brain parenchyma and gd - enhancing leptomeningeal thickening at the base of the brain and spinal level in mri . 
 various treatment modalities were used for 14 patients suffering from pdlg with malignant astrocytic cells reported in the literature so far ( cf . 
 table 1 )  demonstrating the lack of a standardized treatment regimen of pdlg with malignant astrocytic cells . 
 although the number of cases is small  the data on their survival times ( cf . table 2 ) might suggest that radiotherapy and temozolomide ( tmz ) as established treatment for newly diagnosed recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas   also seem to be valid for pdlg with malignant astrocytic cells . 
 this concept is supported by the observation that radiotherapy alone can prolong the median survival time of five months for patients without any specific therapy to a median survival of 12 months and that integration of tmz in the chemotherapy alone may lead to a prolonged median survival of 15 months . 
 the importance of tmz in the chemotherapy treatment of pdlg is supported by the observation that the median survival time fell to 3 months when the integration of tmz was omitted .

 in addition  the hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen used is supposed to be more effective than conventional fractionated irradiation . 
 additionally  the patient 's good karnofsky performance status may have contributed to our patient 's prolonged survival . in conclusion  we report on partial regression and long survival in a patient with pdlg of the malignant astrocytic type following hypofractionated radiotherapy and tmz .

Abstract: Primary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis (PDLG) is a rare neoplasm with a short survival time and no standard treatment. We report a case of a 53-year-old patient who received radiochemotherapy and second-line chemotherapy, with partial tumor regression and the longest survival time reported for this subtype.

Research and Discussion: The patient initially presented with neurological symptoms and was diagnosed with PDLG after imaging and histopathology. Radiochemotherapy including temozolomide showed promise as a basic therapy, with partial tumor regression. However, second-line chemotherapy with irinotecan and bevacizumab did not prevent further clinical deterioration.

Results and Conclusion: The patient survived 22 months, the longest reported survival time for PDLG. Radiochemotherapy and temozolomide may be a valid treatment approach for this subtype. However, further research is needed to establish the most effective therapy for PDLG."
"in past years  numerous studies have described the role of microalbuminuria ( mau ) as a predictor of cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) and death among subjects with type 2 diabetes ( t2d).13 mau is one of the earliest clinical signs for diabetic nephropathy and a significant risk factor for progression to proteinuria.1 additionally  hypertensive t2d individuals with mau have an increased risk of developing end - stage renal disease ( esrd).4 risk factors known to be associated with cvd and diabetic nephropathy are high blood pressure ( bp ) and elevated glycosylated hemoglobin ( a1c).56 achieving adequate bp and glycemic control ( gc ) plays an essential role in preventing renal and cvd events in individuals with t2d . a current secondary analysis from the hispanic health and nutritional examination survey ( hhanes)7 indicated that cuban americans have higher serum cholesterol and systolic bp than puerto ricans and mexican americans . furthermore  compared with other hispanic subgroups  cuban americans have the highest proportion of hypertension ( htn ) and mean serum creatinine levels.8 smith and barnett9 examined the national center for health statistics ( nchs ) from 1996 to 1997 and concluded that cuban americans 35 years of age and older have the highest percentage of diabetes - related deaths compared with other hispanics . although previous studies have shown significant differences and diversity within hispanics  further studies conducted in the cuban american population are scarce . over the past decade  
 the prevalence of t2d has increased  especially among cuban americans who have a higher incidence of diabetes ( 8.2% ) compared with 6.6% of non - hispanic whites.10 the high incidence of t2d combined with an increased risk for developing diabetes complications warrants further examination of the cuban american population . 
 screening for mau can detect individuals at risk for renal dysfunction and cvd events and possibly reduce the burden associated with diabetes complications . 
 therefore  the purpose of this study was to investigate to what degree the coexistence of htn and poor gc influences the likelihood of having mau among cuban americans with t2d . 
 it was hypothesized that individuals with t2d  htn  and poor gc will have an increased likelihood to test positive for mau . 
 it was further hypothesized that this association will be stronger after controlling for confounding variables . 
 this was a cross - sectional study conducted in cuban americans with and without t2d . 
 data from a complete sample set of cuban americans with and without t2d were used in the present study . 
 recruitment of participants was conducted in alternate phases of potential subjects with and without t2d  age matching subjects by age groups . during a 1-year period  
 approximately 10000 letters outlining the study were mailed to subjects aged 30 years or older with and without diabetes . 
 letters were sent in english and spanish and included an invitation flyer to which interested participants could respond . 
 the participants were initially recruited by random selection ( every tenth address ) from a randomly generated mailing list . 
 this company provided a mailing list of cuban americans identified as with and without t2d from miami - dade and broward counties  florida . 
 three percent ( n = 300 ) of the letters were returned due to unknown addresses . from

 only 18 subjects did not qualify for the study for not being cuban americans ( n = 2 )  age younger than 30 years ( n = 9 )  and having other chronic illnesses ( n = 7 ) . if a subject was determined to be eligible  then their participation was requested at the human nutrition laboratory at florida international university ( fiu ) . 
 participants were instructed to refrain from smoking  consuming any food and beverages except water  and doing any unusual exercise for at least 8 hours prior to their blood collection . 
 the purpose and protocol of the study were explained to the subjects  and their written consent  either in spanish or english  was obtained prior to the commencement of the study . 
 seven participants reported not having diabetes but were reclassified because their lab results classified them as having t2d according to american diabetes association ( ada ) standards . 
 for the data analysis  subjects with caloric intakes > 5000 kcals ( n = 2 ) and missing a1c levels ( n = 2 ) were excluded . for two participants  we were unable to perform a1c analysis . in total  we included only the data from subjects with t2d ( n = 179 ) who were aged 30 years and older . 
 a sociodemographic questionnaire was given to each participant to complete  which included questions related to age  gender  smoking status  medications for diabetes  htn  and cholesterol . 
 height and weight were measured using a seca balance scale ( seca corp  columbia  md  usa ) . 
 body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as weight in kg / height in m. bp was measured twice then averaged in participants in a sitting position after a 15-minute rest using a random zero sphygmomanometer ( tycos 5090 - 02 welch allyn pocket aneroid sphygmomanometer  arden  nc  usa ) and a stethoscope ( littmann cardiology  3 m  st paul  mn  usa ) . 
 htn was defined as follows : systolic bp  140 mm hg systolic or diastolic bp  90 mm hg or using antihypertensive treatment.11 dietary intake was measured using a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire ( ffq ) developed by willett et al.12 this ffq has also been validated by nath and huffman13 exclusively for the cuban american population . 
 participants self - reported average consumption of specified amounts of various foods over the past year and chose from frequency responses ranging from  never  to  six or more servings per day  . 
 in addition to food items  the ffq included questions about type and duration of vitamin / mineral supplement use  alcohol consumption  and specific details about fat  salt  and sugar used in cooking and as condiments . 
 macro- and micronutrient intake was calculated by multiplying frequency of consumption by the nutrient value of the food item obtained from the harvard university food composition database ( boston  ma  usa ) . 
 venous blood ( 20 ml ) was collected from each subject after an overnight fast ( at least 8 hours ) by a certified phlebotomist using standard laboratory techniques . 
 blood samples were collected into a vacutainer serum separator tube ( sst ) ( becton  dickinson and company  franklin lakes  nj ) for analysis of lipids and another tube containing ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid to analyze a1c .

 screening for mau with immunodip exhibited a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 80% when compared with albumin : creatinine ratio > 30 ug / mg . when immunodip was examined against quantitatively measured albumin concentrations  the dipstick yielded a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 94% . 
 recommendations from the national academy of clinical biochemistry ( nacb ) for the diagnosis and management of diabetes indicated that a useful semiquantitative screening test for mau should have a sensitivity > 95%.16 the immunodip dipstick fulfilled the requirements from the nacb as a screening tool to detect mau . in our study  
 this cut - off value was established by the manufacturer ( immunodip  diagnostic chemicals ltd ) and corresponded to albumin : creatinine ratio > 30 ug / mg values for mau detection.15 all analyses were performed using spss version 17 ( spss inc .  chicago  il  usa ) . 
 t - tests and chi - square tests were performed to compare means and proportion differences between subjects with and without mau . 
 unadjusted odds ratios and logistic regression analysis were conducted to investigate the extent to which htn and gc are associated with an increased likelihood of having mau . controlled variables included in the logistic regression analysis were age  gender  bmi  known duration of diabetes  total cholesterol levels  diabetes and cholesterol medications  smoking  total kcal and protein intake  and intake of potassium  phosphorous  and sodium .

 t - tests and chi - square tests were performed to compare means and proportion differences between subjects with and without mau . 
 unadjusted odds ratios and logistic regression analysis were conducted to investigate the extent to which htn and gc are associated with an increased likelihood of having mau . controlled variables included in the logistic regression analysis were age  gender  bmi  known duration of diabetes  total cholesterol levels  diabetes and cholesterol medications  smoking  total kcal and protein intake  and intake of potassium  phosphorous  and sodium . 
 mau was present in 26% ( n = 47 ) of cuban americans with t2d . 
 there was a significantly higher percentage of subjects with mau classified as hypertensive ( p = 0.038 ) and taking diabetes medication ( p = 0.039 ) compared with those without mau . 
 additionally  subjects who tested positive for mau had significantly higher a1c levels ( p = 0.002 ) than those with normoalbuminuria ( table 1 ) . 
 unadjusted odds ratios indicated that subjects with poor gc were 3.96 times more likely to have positive mau if they had htn compared with those without htn ( p = 0.014 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] 1.25  12.5 ) ( figure 1 ) . 
 logistic regression analysis showed that after controlling for covariates  subjects with poor gc were 6.76 times more likely to have mau if they had htn compared with those without htn ( p = 0.004 ; 95% ci 1.83  23.05 ) ( table 2 ) . 
 the results of this study showed that htn and poor gc are major contributors to increasing the likelihood of having mau among cuban americans with t2d . 
 the combination and/or interaction of these factors over time might increase the risk for progression to proteinuria / esrd and cvd in this population . 
 our findings are supported by the multicenter study conducted in europe that found that the likelihood of having mau increases in patients when htn and poor gc are present along with other coexisting risk factors for cvd.17 ravid et al5 reported from their longitudinal study that a combination of risk factors  including abnormal bp  plasma cholesterol  a1c levels  high bmi  and male gender  identifies a group of individuals for poor renal and cardiovascular outcomes . maintaining adequate 
 the uk prospective diabetes study ( ukpds)18 a longitudinal study with a 10-year median follow - up  showed that exposure over time to hyperglycemia was associated with diabetes complications in subjects with t2d . 
 this study also indicated that for every 1% reduction in a1c level  the risk for microvascular complications decreased by 37% and diabetes - related death by 21% . 
 a study by thomaseth et al19 showed that in hypertensive t2d subjects with incipient diabetic nephropathy  both tight bp control and optimal gc delay the progression of glomerular filtration rate deterioration . 
 additionally  hypertensive individuals with t2d under tight bp control experience a reduction in risk for microvascular and macrovascular complications.20 the mechanism and pathways involving mau with diabetic nephropathy and cvd are not fully understood . 
 they may be interrelated with endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.21 stehouwer et al22 examined the relationship between endothelial dysfunction and inflammation with mau and risk of death in a prospective study among subjects with t2d . 
 the results of that study showed that those participants with mau  endothelial dysfunction  and inflammation had an increased risk in mortality ; however  the associations of these variables with risk of mortality were independent from each other . 
 hyperglycemia and obesity were associated with an increase in markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation activity22 possibly indicating that the combinations of these factors may be interrelated in increasing the risk of death . 
 the usual course of mau is progressive ; however  not all t2d individuals with mau will develop macroalbuminuria . 
 several authors have documented remission and/or regression of mau in subjects with t2d.2327 antihypertensive therapy has been shown to reduce or slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy . in a 6-year prospective study  remission and regression to normoalbuminuria were observed in about 50% of t2d individuals.23 other factors independently linked with remission and/or regression of mau were proper bp and gc and short duration of mau . 
 the study by chan et al24 with a 5-year mean follow - up of t2d patients with mau treated with angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) inhibitor medications showed a 13% reduction in urinary albumin excretion ( uae ) . 
 in addition  the authors pointed out the main role that bp and gc play in renal function . 
 t2d individuals treated with angiotensin receptor blockers ( arbs ) ( eg  irbesartan and valsatran ) experienced a 38% and 44% reduction in uae over 2-year and 6-month follow - ups  respectively.2526 evidence from another prospective study with a 7.8-year follow - up indicated that 30% of the participants on antihypertensive therapy achieved remission to normoalbuminuria.27 additionally  the odds for remission to normoalbuminuria increased in these participants with every 1% decrease in a1c level . 
 furthermore  in a study conducted by mogensen et al28 urinary albumin : creatinine ratio was decreased by 50% after a 3-month combination treatment with arb and ace inhibitors in hypertensive t2d individuals with mau . 
 remission and/or regression of mau may not only conserve renal function but also reduce the risk of cvd . 
 testing for mau has been recommended by the ada in individuals with t2d to be performed at diagnosis of diabetes and every year afterwards.29 the immunodip dipstick is a rapid and easy screening test to perform  does not involve equipment and/or skilled personnel  exhibits a high sensitivity  requires only a random urine sample ( first morning urine is recommended )  and has a relatively low cost . however  this test does not quantify urinary albumin values and requires confirmation with a secondary analysis . 
 this method can be used in a physician s office and/or research setting as a first screening tool to detect the presence of mau . the clinical significance of early screening and monitoring for mau 
 is possibly to improve individuals prognosis for microvascular and macrovascular complications  especially among t2d individuals with other concomitant conditions . 
 first  due to the cross - sectional design of the study  single - voided urine was collected to measure mau  and we were not able to determine the cause 
 second  due to the relatively small sample size in this study  our sample of cuban americans with t2d is not representative of the entire cuban american population living in the usa . 
 nevertheless  to our knowledge  this is the first and only study that has examined the relationship between mau  htn  and gc in this hispanic subgroup  which has an increased risk for t2d and cvd .

 the therapeutic goals and strategies for mau should focus on preventing long - term complications associated with t2d  such as kidney and heart diseases . 
 further investigations need to be carried out to fully understand the mechanism and absolute cvd risk that an individual with t2d has when mau coexists with other comorbidities .","


Abstract:
A cross-sectional study was conducted on 179 Cuban Americans with type 2 diabetes to investigate the relationship between hypertension (HTN) and poor glycemic control (GC) on the likelihood of having microalbuminuria (MAU). Results showed that having both HTN and poor GC significantly increased the odds of MAU.

Research and Discussion:
Participants were recruited from a mailing list and had their blood pressure and A1C levels measured. Results showed that 26% of patients had MAU, with a significantly higher percentage having HTN and elevated A1C. Logistic regression analysis showed that those with poor GC and HTN were 6.76 times more likely to have MAU than those without HTN.

Results and Conclusion:
The study emphasizes the importance of early detection of MAU in Cuban Americans with type 2 diabetes. Good glycemic control and blood pressure management are essential in preventing and treating diabetes complications, ultimately improving renal and cardiovascular outcomes. "
"cancer is the second leading cause of mortality and morbidity in both developed and developing countries . in india  
 cancer prevalence is estimated around 2.5 million  with over 0.8 million new cases and 0.5 million deaths occurring each year . 
 there is an increase in the incidence of breast cancer and found to be gradually overtaking cancer of the cervix 
 . breast self - examination ( bse ) is an important screening measure for detecting breast cancer .

 the data was analyzed using descriptive ( frequency and percentage ) and inferential statistics based on the objectives and hypotheses . 
 the data presented in table 1 shows that among 40 samples  the majority ( 52.5% ) of the samples were in the age group of 18 - 19 years and majority ( 90% ) of them were studying in basic science group . 
 sample characteristics only 35% of them were heard about bse through mass media and 8.5% of participant ( only one participant ) were practiced bse only one time at the time of study . 
 the description of knowledge scores shows that 72.5% of students had average knowledge on bse in pre test and 85% of students had good knowledge score in post - test [ figure 1  table 2 ] . 
 t test computed to test the effectiveness of planned teaching program on bse ( t=12.46 ) shown in table 3 . 
 percentage distribution of sample based on knowledge score frequency and percentage of knowledge score computation of effectiveness of planned teaching program the  computed to find the association between knowledge and selected variables shows no significant association between knowledge and selected variables . 
 hence the null hypotheses was accepted and research hypotheses was rejected shown in table 4 . 
 a survey conducted among nurses and midwives in turkey found that among 80 samples only 52% of samples performed bse  no significant relation was found between sociodemographic factor and bse . a study conducted in chennai by s. aruna supported this study as no significant association found between demographic variables and level of knowledge of breast cancer and bse among working women . 
 study conducted among resettlement colony women  shows that they have poor knowledge on breast cancer and risk factors  warning signs and early detection procedure . 
 the world health organization stresses on promoting awareness in the community and encouraging early diagnosis of breast cancer  especially for women aged 40 - 69 years who are attending primary health care centres of hospitals for other reason  by offering clinical breast examination . 
 there are other many methods to detect the breast cancer but those are expensive for the community . 
 breast - related matters are sensitive issues for few females ; unless the breast lesions starts bothering them they may not seek medical attention . 
 bse is the cheapest and convenient method to detect the breast cancer in the early stage . 
 in this study majority of the samples acquired good knowledge on bse . bse plays a major role in early detection and prevention or prompt treatment of breast cancer . by giving teaching to the young girls  they can teach their mother and siblings so that the incidence of the breast cancer may be reduced . 
 it is essential task of each and every woman to do bse and protect herself and her family . 
 the nurse has to play an important role in health promotion and it is only possible when she teaches or educates her client . 
 however  the teaching of bse can help women to be alert to any abnormal changes in their breasts and seek medical advice immediately .","

1) Abstract: Breast cancer is a significant health concern in India, accounting for a large percentage of cancer cases in women. Lack of awareness and screening programs often lead to late stage diagnosis and high mortality rates. Early detection through breast self-examination (BSE) can improve survival rates. 

2) Research and Discussion: A study was conducted among 40 female students in Udupi to assess their knowledge and effectiveness of a teaching program on BSE. Majority of the participants had average knowledge on BSE and only one student reported performing BSE occasionally. This highlights the need for increasing awareness among young women for early detection of breast cancer. 

3) Results and Conclusion: The results showed that awareness on BSE is crucial among younger generations for early detection of breast cancer. The study also highlighted the effectiveness of education programs in increasing knowledge and promoting regular BSE. Better awareness and education on BSE can improve the chances of long-term survival for breast cancer patients."

 der p 1 is a 25-kd cysteine protease whose structure has been modeled 7 on the crystal structure of papain  with which it shows considerable sequence similarities  most notably for residues involved in the enzyme active site 8 . 
 the proteolytic activity of der p 1 can be inhibited by e-64  the class - specific inhibitor of microbial origin 9 . 
 this inhibition is brought about when cysteine within the der p 1 active site forms a thioether covalent bond with the epoxy group of e-64 . 
 this is an irreversible process that does not lead to significant structural changes  as evidenced by crystallographic studies of a papain  e-64 complex 10 . 
 we have purified der p 1 from fecal pellets using a multistep procedure and confirmed its purity by nh2-terminal sequencing  sds - page analysis  and demonstration that enzymatic activity was completely dependent on preactivation with cysteine and inhibited by e-64 and iodoacetamide ( fig . 
 1 ) . we have recently shown that der p 1 selectively cleaves human cd25 from the surfaces of peripheral blood t cells 4 . here 
 we demonstrate that der p 1 also selectively cleaves cd25 from cultured mouse spleen t cells ( fig . 
 2 )  which is not surprising given the high degree of sequence homology that exists between human 11 and mouse 12 cd25 . 
 this observation has therefore provided the justification for using this animal species for testing our hypothesis  namely that the proteolytic activity of der p 1 is a major contributor to its allergenicity . 
 intraperitoneal immunization of groups of 10 cba / j mice with either proteolytically active or inactive ( e-64blocked ) der p 1 over a 6-wk period showed a statistically significant enhancement in total ige ( p < 0.01 ) and der p 1specific ige ( p < 0.02 ) responses in animals immunized with proteolytically active der p 1 . 
 this effect was ige specific  as der p 1specific igg  igg1  and igg2b responses increased to the same extent with proteolytically active or inactive der p 1 ( fig . 
 we are not sure why the igg1 response did not follow that of ige  as these two isotypes are considered to be coregulated in the mouse . 
 however  the ige - restricted enhancement seen in response to immunization with proteolytically active der p 1 does suggest a mechanism that is unique to ige isotype switching / synthesis . 
 furthermore  our control experiments clearly show that the ige - specific effect observed here is not due to e-64 exerting a suppressive influence on ige production by a mechanism that is independent of its binding to the der p 1 enzyme active site ( fig . 
  suppression of total ige ( p < 0.04 ) and der p 1specific ige ( p < 0.05 ) productions was also obtained when the proteolytic activity of der p 1 was blocked with iodoacetamide  another sulfhydryl reactive agent . 
 second  the ige antibody response to ova  a proteolytically inactive antigen  was not suppressed when the animals were immunized with ova plus e-64 . 
 our results are direct evidence that the cysteine protease activity of der p 1 induces a significant increase in ige responses . 
 such an effect is clearly consistent with the ability of der p 1 to proteolytically cleave mouse cd25 and induce a th2 response by modulating the balance between il-4 and ifn- 13 . 
 the recent demonstration in mice that leishmania mexicana cysteine proteinase  deficient mutants potentiate a th1 response  compared with the th2 response normally seen in response to infection with wild - type parasite 14  is also of great relevance here . 
 allergic individuals could potentially be achieved by administering der p 1 in a catalytically inactive ( mutant ) form . on the other hand  
 exploring the potential th2 adjuvant property of the proteolytic activity of der p 1 would have important implications in defining principles for modulation of th1-mediated pathological conditions . 
 our demonstration that the cysteine protease activity of der p 1 enhances total ige production  apart from increasing der p 1-specific ige  suggests that this allergen may play a central role in destabilizing the microenvironment within target tissues to one that is proallergic and thus aids in the initiation and propagation of the allergic cascade . 
 in other words  the proteolytic activity of der p 1 may exert an ige - specific adjuvant effect . 
 the in vivo relevance of the proteolytic activity of der p 1 is further highlighted by reports demonstrating that it increases the permeability of the human respiratory epithelium to macromolecules 1516 . 
 such observations  together with our current findings showing a direct effect on the immune system  indicate that the proteolytic activity of der p 1 is a major contributor to its allergenicity .","

Abstract: The house dust mite allergen Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergen Der p 1 is the most potent inducer of dust mite-specific IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Its potent allergenicity is likely due to its cysteine protease activity, but the exact mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that active Der p 1 induces a significant increase in total IgE and Der p 1-specific IgE compared to inactive Der p 1, suggesting that its proteolytic activity plays a major role in its allergenic properties.

Research and Discussion: Previous in vitro studies have linked the allergenicity of Der p 1 to its cysteine protease activity, but this is the first study to demonstrate its effects in vivo. Mice immunized with active Der p 1 showed a significant enhancement in total IgE and Der p 1-specific IgE production compared to mice immunized with inactive Der p 1. This supports the hypothesis that the proteolytic activity of Der p 1 is a major contributor to its potent allergenicity.

Results and Conclusion: Our results indicate that the proteolytic activity of Der p 1 is an important factor in its allergenicity. This further supports the need for developing inhibitors of Der p 1 proteolytic activity as potential therapeutic treatments for dust mite allergies. Future studies could also explore the specific mechanisms by which this activity contributes to the allergenicity of Der p 1."
"given the risk of paralysis associated with cervical transforaminal injection  is it time to reconsider transforaminal injections of the lumbar spine ? 
 arguments for discontinuing lumbar injections have been discussed in the anesthesia literature  raising concern about the risks of epidural steroid injections ( esis ) . 
 in a 47-year - old man  paraplegia of the lower extremities developed  specifically conus medullaris syndrome  after he underwent an esi for recurrent pain . 
 the patient felt his legs  going dead  ; paraplegia of the lower extremities was noted . 
 an initial magnetic resonance imaging study performed after the patient was transferred to the emergency department was unremarkable . however  a later neurosurgical evaluation showed conus medullaris syndrome  and a second magnetic resonance imaging study showed the conus infarct . 
 we conducted a search of the pubmed database of articles from 2002 to 2011 containing the following keywords : complications  lumbar epidural steroid injection(s )  cauda equina syndrome  conus medullaris infarction  spinal cord infarction  spinal cord injury  paralysis  paresis  plegia  paresthesia  and anesthesia . 
 summarizing this case and 5 similar cases  we weigh the potential benefits and risks of esi . although one can safely assume that this severe  devastating complication is rare  we speculate that its true incidence remains unknown  possibly because of medicolegal implications . 
 we believe that the rarity of this complication should not preclude the continued use of transforaminal esi ; rather  it should be emphasized for discussion with patients during the consent process . 
 a 47-year - old man who had undergone an l4/l5 laminectomy and discectomy 5 years earlier presented with recurrent pain in the left buttock and posterior leg . 
 after receiving an esi by a local anesthesiology group within the cincinnati  ohio  area  the patient was transferred from the outpatient pain clinic to our institution . 
 information regarding his medical history and prior treatment  as well as details of the procedure  was limited to that provided by the patient himself or the accompanying procedure report . 
 the patient reported that he had previously received esis on the left side of his lower back ; this was the second injection in a series of 3 . 
 correct needle placement in the left l5-s1 neural foramen was verified with epidurography immediately after the injection  the patient felt his legs  going dead  ; paraplegia of the lower extremities was noted . 
 because of the concern for intrathecal injection with resultant motor blockade  the patient was monitored for 4 hours . 
 when no clinical improvement was observed  he was transferred to a nearby community hospital emergency department for neurologic examination . 
 although the initial magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) study performed in the emergency department was unremarkable ( fig . 
 however  a second mri study to evaluate the possibility of vascular complications obtained 48 hours after the injection showed a conus infarct ( fig . 
 2 ) . five hours after esi in a 47-year - old man  magnetic resonance imaging scans performed at the emergency department were unremarkable  showing a normal appearing conus . ( a ) 
 ( b ) t1-weighted sagittal image ( repetition time  416.7 ; echo time  15.0 ) . magnetic resonance images ( about 48 hours after the procedure ) showing extensive signal abnormalities within the lower thoracic spinal cord and conus compatible with the clinical diagnosis of conus infarct . 
 ( a ) t1-weighted sagittal image ( repetition time  675.0 ; echo time  9.6 ) . ( b ) t2-weighted sagittal image ( repetition time  3640.0 ; echo time  102.0 ) . 
 ( c ) short tau inversion recovery ( stir ) sagittal image ( repetition time  4000.0 ; echo time  58.0 ) . at 1-month 
 follow - up  the patient could walk without assistance with a slow and calculated gait  had symmetric lower - extremity strength  and had dorsiflexion strength of 4 of 5 bilaterally . 
 his urinary urge sensation had returned  and occasional episodes of fecal incontinence occurred in relation to bladder overdistention . 
 our search of the pubmed database ( 20022011 ) included the keywords complications  lumbar epidural steroid injection(s )  cauda equina syndrome  conus medullaris infarction  spinal cord infarction  spinal cord injury  paralysis  paresis  plegia  paresthesia  and anesthesia . 
 esi is regarded as an effective and conservative means of treating low - back pain resulting from nerve root inflammation . 
 recent case reports of post - procedural conus medullaris syndrome after spinal vascular compromise raise the question regarding safety . 
 our case represents a sixth patient in whom conus medullaris syndrome developed after sustaining an acute spinal cord infarct during esi . in 5 other case reports ( table 1 )  this complication affected patients ( aged 4271 years ) who had previous lumbar surgery and then underwent a transforaminal steroid injection . of note  findings of spinal cord injury were not detectable on the initial mri study within the first 24 hours in 1 case . 
 injections are typically evaluated first by aspiration and injection of contrast . a nonvascular penetrating injection of contrast media verifies safe needle placement . however  in a series of 761 lumbosacral transforaminal injections performed  furman et al . 
 reported that the sensitivity of positive flash or actual aspiration was only 44.7%  because only 38 of 85 patients had shown either flash or actual aspiration before injection . 
 specifically  they showed that there was an 11.2% rate of vascular injection in their series . in evaluating correct placement of 316 caudal - approach esis  
 implicated aspiration as an errorprone method for verifying needle placement  reporting a 9.2% incidence of vascular violation despite negative findings on aspiration . 
 blood is supplied to the caudal - most portion of the spinal cord by the anterior spinal artery  2 posterior spinal arteries  segmental radiculomedullary arterial branches  and most importantly  the artery of adamkiewicz . 
 the location of the artery of adamkiewicz  which is the primary blood supply to the conus medullaris  is fairly unpredictable . 
 it travels with the nerve through the foramen at or near the level of its origin from the thoracolumbar segmental arteries . 
 . showed that the artery of adamkiewicz originated from the left t9 - 12 posterior intercostal arteries in 75% of cases and from the l1 - 2 lumbar arteries in 10% of cases . in 31 
 cadavers biglioli et al . located this artery between t12 and l3 in 26 cases ( 83.9% ) . 
 in a 2002 review of more than 4000 spinal angiograms  lo et al . examined the variability of the artery of adamkiewicz  noting that it originated at l2 in 1% of cases and l4 in 0.075% of cases . 
 of the proposed mechanisms by which spinal cord medullary infarction may occur  one explanation may be the combined effect of an undetected direct arterial injection into a low - lying artery of adamkiewicz and the resultant embolic incident from the injectate . 
 houten and errico proposed that the collaterals surrounding the cord at the level of this artery were proximal to the injection site and thus allowed direct passage of the injected material into the conus . however  as discussed by lo et al . 
 considering this observation  we believe that it is unlikely that our patient had this low - lying artery that could have then been injected with an epidural steroid at this precise location . 
 another plausible explanation is that an inadvertent sacral radicular artery injection carried injection material distally to the spinal cord . 
 reported that material injected into the abdominal aorta below the level of the artery of adamkiewicz would appear in the conus through collateralization . 
 the most likely cause is injection of steroid particulate through either the artery of adamkiewicz or collateral radiculomedullary arterial branches . 
 prior lumbar surgery may lead to compromise of normal vascular supply to the spinal cord  thus making it more susceptible to vascular injury . 
 subsequent thrombus formation would result in an embolic infarct in the spinal cord supplied by the affected artery . 
 florey noted that such vasoconstriction was a local effect lasting 5 seconds to 10 minutes at the site of injury only . 
 found that fine needle ( 30-gauge ) arterial puncture in rhesus monkeys induced intense vasospasm  typically lasting anywhere from 4 hours to 4 days . 
 many studies have examined mechanically induced vasospasm of the cerebral vasculature and may be indirectly suggestive that a similar phenomenon can occur in the spinal cord and conus medullaris . of the multiple recommendations made to avoid such devastating complications as paralysis  
 first and foremost is the strict adherence to the standard and widely accepted techniques of transforaminal esis . 
 these guidelines include the use of multiplanar fluoroscopy or computed tomography guidance together with contrast material to prevent complications . 
 if recovery of neurologic function fails to occur in a patient within a 2- to 3-hour time period after esi  an initial mri study may be obtained to exclude an epidural hematoma . 
 repeat mri after 24 hours should be performed as well . in our patient  as well as 1 other reported case  a delayed effect was observed with mri signal changes occurring after 24 hours . 
 given the risk of paralysis associated with cervical transforaminal injection  is it time to reconsider transforaminal injections of the lumbar spine ? 
 although the risk of permanent neurologic deficit is negligible  arguments for discontinuing lumbar injections have been presented in the anesthesia literature . however  when one considers the potential benefit of this noninvasive treatment modality  abandoning such injections may be premature . however  we speculate that more than 6 cases of conus medullaris syndrome after esi have occurred  and medicolegal considerations may explain why they may go unreported . at the very least 
  patients should be clearly informed regarding the potential risks of esi  including paralysis . 
 although one can safely assume that this severe  devastating complication is rare  its true incidence remains unknown . in our opinion  the rarity of this complication should  at this time  not preclude the continued use of transforaminal esi for relief of pain in select patients but should be included in the consent process .",".


1) Abstract: The risk of paralysis associated with cervical transforaminal injections raises concerns about the safety of lumbar injections. We present a case of paraplegia following a lumbar epidural steroid injection and discuss the potential risks and benefits of this procedure.
2) Research and Discussion: A literature search was conducted to investigate complications associated with lumbar epidural steroid injections. We found a rare but severe complication of conus medullaris syndrome and weigh its potential implications on the continued use of transforaminal injections.
3) Results and Conclusion: A 47-year-old man developed paraplegia after receiving a lumbar epidural steroid injection for recurrent pain. This case and others highlight the need for informed consent and further discussion with patients to ensure the safe use of lumbar injections. The rarity of complications should not deter the continued use of this procedure. "

1) Abstract:
This study investigates the potential of three assays for detecting estrogenic chemicals on 10 known or suspected estrogenic chemicals. The assays included competitive binding, transcriptional activation, and the uterotropic assay. Results were consistent among the three assays.

2) Research and Discussion:
The three assays were used to screen chemicals for estrogenic activity and assessed their utility. Consistent results were obtained, providing information on hormonal activity levels. This three-assay combination is a promising approach in detecting estrogenic chemicals in the environment.

3) Results and Conclusion:
The results of the three assays were consistent with what is known about the estrogenic activities of the chemicals tested. The combination of the three assays provides an informative profile of estrogenic activity with a reasonable investment of resources. This approach can be used in routine screening of chemicals for potential estrogenic effects."
"alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is clinically characterized by progressive mental decline and histopathologically defined by highly abundant amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain parenchyma . 
 the identification of mutations within the amyloid precursor protein ( app ) and presenilin ( ps ) genes that cause autosomal dominantly inherited ad and that result in increased production of amyloid - prone forms of a established beyond doubt that the processing of app and the production of a peptides are intimately involved in the disease process and led to the proposal and the reinforcement of the alzheimer amyloid cascade hypothesis [ 1  2 ] . 
 the role of amyloid in neuronal dysfunction has recently been extended by the discovery of small  soluble  oligomers of the a peptide  some forms of which have been termed addls ( a-derived diffusible ligands )  protofibrils  or a*56 [ 36 ] . 
 these a oligomers are not only potential intermediates in the formation of amyloid filaments  but they also have been shown to be neurotoxic themselves and to inhibit long - term potentiation ( ltp )  a cellular model of memory  in hippocampal slices [ 4  7  8 ] . 
 thus  the amyloid cascade hypothesis now includes the essential role of a oligomers in the neurodegeneration process .   despite its strength 
  the amyloid cascade hypothesis is incomplete without including the essential role of amyloid - associated inflammatory proteins . 
 for example  biochemical and histological studies first showed that  in addition to a  amyloid deposits also contained the inflammation / acute phase protein 1-antichymotrypsin ( act )   and  later  apolipoprotein e ( apoe ) [ 10  11 ]  which were both hypothesized to serve as catalysts or 
 pathological chaperones  of amyloid formation [ 9  11  12 ] . these and other results also indicated that alzheimer 's disease and its manifestation in middle - aged down syndrome may include an inflammatory process  for both act and apoe are inflammatory and/or acute phase proteins in other contexts  and both are overexpressed in affected regions of the ad brain ( for reviews see [ 1315 ] ) . 
 indeed  alzheimer himself first identified the inflammatory component of alzheimer 's disease when he described reactive astrocytes and microglia in affected brain regions of his first patient . 
 however  until inflammatory proteins such as act  il-1  hla  and apoe were found to be overexpressed in ad and ds brains  the term  inflammation  was explicitly excluded from the clinical and pathological description of ad because of the lack of edema and lymphocyte infiltration [ 911  17  18 ] . 
 the significance of these biochemical results instigated and was reinforced by parallel genetic discoveries implicating a role for inflammation in ad . 
 in particular  inheritance of the apoe 4 allele was found to be the strongest known risk factor for ad besides age  with one copy increasing ad risk 35-fold and two copies over 10-fold [ 1921 ] . 
 because of apoe 's essential genetic  and therefore presumably biochemical  contribution to ad pathology and cognitive decline  it is critical that its role in the ad pathogenic pathway / amyloid cascade be elucidated in order for therapeutics based on apoe to be designed . while recent excellent and encyclopedic literature reviews describe the many potential roles that apoe plays in ad [ 2326 
 ]  this focused review will concentrate on the interaction between a and apoe and other inflammatory proteins  on the effects of such interactions  and on their implications for designing apoe - based ad therapies . 
 the central question we try to answer is whether increasing or decreasing apoe level and/or function will serve best to reduce ad / ds pathology and cognitive decline . 
 lack of a clear answer may lead to the development of drugs that  rather than serving as an ad therapy  instead potentially exacerbate the disease . 
 to determine whether inflammation contributes to alzheimer 's disease rather than being merely a correlative pathological feature in the ad brain  we and others tested the hypothesis that act and/or apoe serve as amyloid catalysts or pathological chaperones . 
 numerous in vitro and in vivo studies showed that mature amyloid deposition and the associated cognitive decline is strongly stimulated by apoe and act in a dose - dependent and isoform - specific manner  with apoe4 being the strongest promoter of a polymerization and apoe2 being an inhibitor  paralleling the effect of these two isoforms in humans [ 2738 ] . 
 indeed  without one or the other of these amyloid catalysts expressed in the brain  amyloid deposition is profoundly delayed in app transgenic mice and does not become filamentous . 
 such app+/apoe ko animals also exhibit normal cognition despite levels of a expression equal to the apoe - expressing app animals . 
 elegant work by manelli and colleagues also showed that native lipidated apoe4 from transgene replacement astrocytes increases a neurotoxicity compared to apoe3 or e2  indicating that apoe4 provides a negative gain of function . 
 finally  jones and colleagues recently showed that apoe4 also promotes the conversion and enhanced synaptic localization of a as oligomers  the most neurotoxic form of the alzheimer amyloid peptide [ 40  41 ] . 
 these recent studies extended prior work showing that apoe copurifies with a during biochemical isolation of amyloid from human brains  and that apoe preferentially interacts with a peptides in a -sheet structure [ 4245 ] . 
 together these results show that inflammatory proteins  particularly apoe  are integral parts of the amyloid cascade  and that without them the cascade would be arrested at the level of the harmless a monomer  and no ad would ensue . 
 the view of apoe as an integral and pathological part of the amyloid cascade has been shaken by experiments that suggest that apoe  far from being an amyloid catalyst  serves to clear a from the brain . under this view 
  apoe is protective  with human apoe4 being less protective than apoe3 or e2 ( for the most recent discussion  see   and commentary at http://www.alzforum.com/ ) . 
 the first experiments that suggested apoe 's role as a neuroprotector examined the pathology and cognition of app transgenic mice carrying a second transgene expressing one or another human apoe isoform . 
 contrary to expectations  amyloid deposition in these mice was inhibited by the human apoe transgene  as though human apoe was protective . 
 ultimately  the mice did develop amyloid  with the apoe4-expressing strain accumulating earlier and more extensive pathology [ 33  34  48  49 ] . 
 it was proposed that human apoe might serve to inhibit a clearance from the brain compared to mouse apoe  with apoe4 inhibiting clearance the most . 
 other experiments showed that indeed  clearance of a species was inhibited by complexing with apoe  especially apoe4 [ 46  50 ] . 
 the possibility that interaction with apoe modulated an a clearance mechanism appeared to be supported by the finding that introduction of anti - a antibodies or other a-binding proteins such as gelsolin  led to a reduced amyloid load in the brain and rapidly improved cognition  with little evidence of a-binding agents invading the brain parenchyma [ 4154 ] . 
 we also introduced apoe itself into the circulation via parabiosis and found that it induced amyloid clearance without entering the brain in ad model mice . 
 thus the  peripheral sink hypothesis  became a viable alternative or addition to the amyloid cascade hypothesis  with apoe potentially playing an additional role as an a-binding peripheral protein . 
 most recently  an approach to therapy has been investigated in ad mice that is based on activating the liver x receptor ( lxr )  which also exists on other cells including microglia [ 5557 ] . 
 activation of lxr results in increased expression of many proteins including apoe and its lipidating enzyme  atp - binding cassette transporter a1 ( abca1 ) . 
 the results indicate that activating lxr with the ligand gw3965 or the fda - approved antiskin cancer drug bexarotene reduces soluble and insoluble a and improves cognition in app tg mice  while knocking out the abca1 gene in app mice showed a tendency to reduced amyloid load . 
 because apoe expression and lipidation is stimulated by lxr activation  the results were interpreted as proof that increased apoe levels help microglia clear a and amyloid  as indeed some earlier cell culture experiments had suggested . 
 however  it has also been shown that genetic overexpression of abca1 reduces amyloid deposition in mice where the apoe levels are unchanged . hence  because lxr stimulation influences the levels of many proteins  it is problematic to definitively link its in vivo action to the altered level of one particular protein . furthermore  the increased levels of abca1 induced by bexarotene enhance apoe lipidation  a change that is known to alter apoe / a interactions . 
 hence  it is important to consider the lipidation state of apoe  which affects its function  in addition to the absolute levels of apoe . 
 when trying to distinguish and weigh the value of two hypotheses  it is instructive to consider their testable predictions . if apoe is an amyloid catalyst  then reducing apoe levels or function in the brain should result in reduced amyloid deposition and reduced cognitive decline . 
 if on the other hand  apoe is involved in a clearance with human apoe4 being a greater inhibitor of clearance ( or poorer clearer )  then reducing apoe levels or apoe binding to a should increase amyloid deposition and cognitive decline . 
 all experiments carried out so far in vitro or in transgenic mice indicate that the ability of a to form neurotoxic filaments or oligomers and cause cognitive decline are increased in the presence of apoe  particularly mouse apoe and human apoe4  with apoe2 being protective . in contrast  in the complete absence of apoe  the mutant app gene and its product a are harmless  generating neither amyloid deposits  synaptic disfunction  or cognitive decline  with one copy of apoe having an intermediate effect  as discussed above . 
 the in vitro experiments in particular indicate that apoe likely acts catalytically to promote a polymerization  as the molar ratio of a to apoe of about 200/1 was appropriate for the formation of neurotoxic products [ 2730 ] . 
 most recently  earlier work showing that mice expressing only one apoe gene accumulated less amyloid than those with two apoe genes ( 32 ) was repeated in two different laboratories using human apoe knock - in mice  and the same result was found  that is  lower doses of apoe3 or apoe4 led to reduced amyloid deposition [ 59  60 ] . 
 the simplest interpretation of the in vitro  cell culture  and transgenic mouse data is that apoe is necessary for a to polymerize into neurotoxic oliogomers / filaments  probably by binding to a and thus altering its structure more toward the -sheet and more easily allowing successive a peptides to add on to the growing chain . 
 the recent finding that apoe promotes a oligomer formation in vivo reinforces this interpretation [ 40  41 ] . whether apoe is only needed to initiate the polymerization or also to prepare each peptide for addition to the growing filament is not yet known .   even though the key predictions of the polymerization hypothesis  that is apoe serving as an a filament catalyst  have been borne out  the compelling experiments demonstrating that human apoe inhibits filament formation in a mouse background require explanation . 
 furthermore  data from ladu and colleagues and by others have shown that lipidated apoe  presumably the prevalent form in vivo  binds a with an affinity of e2 > e3 
 finally  the elegant and thorough experiments of castellano and colleagues show very convincingly that expression of a human apoe4 transgene ( in the absence of mouse apoe ) leads to a longer half - life  ( i.e.  slower clearance ) of a in the brain interstitial fluid compared to e2 or e3 . 
 the apoe - a binding studies might be interpreted as support for apoe functioning in a clearance because apoe2  for example  would bind a tightly and could thereby promote its removal from the interstitial fluid via lrp receptors [ 50  6164 ] . 
 however  an important feature of any catalyst is that it must bind its substrate only tightly enough to convert it to the transition state structure and then release it as the reaction is completed [ 65  66 ] . 
 if a mutation leads to an overly tight substrate binding  then no further reaction can occur . 
 thus apoe2 could indeed bind a most tightly  and thereby not only prevent apoe4 from binding and promoting a oligo / polymerization  but also prevent the spontaneous polymerization of the peptide . 
 the ability of different apoe isoforms to bind a with different strengths can also explain why human apoe isoforms slow amyloid deposition in the presence of the endogenous mouse apoe  for they may bind a more tightly or differently than mouse apoe and slow the catalytic conversion of a into oligomers / polymers in the mouse background . 
 the data showing that human apoe inhibits a clearance can also be interpreted as reflecting apoe 's role in catalyzing a oligo / polymerization . 
 pathologic macromolecular structures are often resistant to various clearance mechanisms designed for monomeric species  whether by intracellular proteasome degradation or cross - membrane / bbb transfer  thus allowing their accumulation . only when oligo / polymeric structures are anticipated and physiological clearance mechanisms are in place to handle them  as for antibody - antigen complexes  will clearance be facilitated by conversion to larger structures . because apoe clearly has the ability to catalyze the conversion of a into oligomeric and polymeric structures  it is reasonable to assume that those structures will be more difficult to clear  and that such difficulty will be detected as clearance inhibition in the brain  for instance  by apoe4  in pulse chase type experiments  while the higher apoe levels in blood may aid the clearance of a from the circulations ( figure 1 ) . 
 finally  the ability of gw3965 and bexarotene to reduce soluble and insoluble a in the brain of tg app mice and improve cognition is most easily understood as resulting from a general activation of the phagocytic activity of microglia . 
 previous work showed that activation of microglia by acute intracerebral treatment of app mice with lps or with granulocyte - macrophage stimulating factor can similarly reduce amyloid load and improve cognition [ 6769 ] but that long - term peripheral treatment with lps exacerbated amyloid deposition in an apoe - dependent manner . 
 stimulation of microglial activity via induction of toll - like receptor 9 ( tlr9 ) has also been shown to greatly reduce amyloid load and improve cognition . clearly the interaction of neuroinflammation  microglia  and amyloid load is complex  and the fact that bexarotene  cures 
 ad in mice is more likely to be despite  rather than because it stimulates expression of apoe . 
 a good test of any hypothesis about the pathogenesis of a disease is whether it successfully predicts how the pathogenesis can be inhibited or reversed . 
 for example  small fragments of a corresponding to the amino acid sequences to which act ( a1 - 12 ) and apoe ( a12 - 28 ) bind can serve as decoy peptides that prevent the binding of apoe to a and its catalysis of a into neurotoxic species . this early in vitro work has recently been repeated and confirmed in other laboratories [ 72  73 ] . 
 the decoy principal was extended in vivo by preparing a version of a12 - 28 that has a better plasma 1/2 life and is nonfibrillogenic / nontoxic . 
 it was shown that this peptide could be peripherally introduced into a transgenic app mouse  where it effectively entered the brain and prevented / reversed oligomer formation  amyloid deposition  and cognitive decline [ 7476 ] . 
 similarly  amyloid plaques in app mice contain mouse act and injecting a1 - 11 into one side of the app mouse brain to block act 's binding site with endogenous a rapidly reduced amyloid load compared to the other  vehicle - injected side of the brain . 
 furthermore the inflammatory cytokine il-1 that is overexpressed in ad brain   induces astrocyte expression of act  and blocking il-1 expression in app transgenic mice by ibuprofen treatment  thereby reducing mouse act expression  lowers amyloid formation and restores cognition . 
 evidently  blocking act or apoe expression or function  both in vitro or in vivo  successfully prevents a pathology and neurotoxicity . 
 apolipoprotein j also binds a and can be shown to aid its passage across the blood brain barrier [ 7983 ] . 
 interestingly  knocking out either apoj or apoe reduces amyloid deposition in app transgenic animals  yet knocking out both leads to robust amyloid deposition at an even earlier age than arises in nonmanipulated app animals . 
 this result may reflect the ability of mouse act to promote amyloid formation  but that in the presence of the stronger binding apoe and apoj proteins mouse act is prevented from exhibiting its catalytic activity . 
 the role of apoe and act in the alzheimer pathogenic pathway has potentially general implications . 
 one of the most studied classes of a binding proteins are specific anti - a antibodies  which form the basis of both passive and active immunization therapies for alzheimer 's disease ( for review see ) . 
 the finding that apoe and act can catalyze a oligo / polymerization begs the question of whether a antibodies might also promote or inhibit a polymerization . 
 indeed we found that two a antibodies  6e10 which is directed to the same the n - terminal sequence bound by act  and 13  m  which binds to the c - terminus  function very differently in the in vitro a polymerization assay . 
 6e10 inhibits act - catalyzed polymerization of a while 13  m inhibits act catalysis much less and even promotes some polymerization itself . 
 interestingly  the n - terminus of a is also the target of many attempts at ad immunotherapy with the aim of inducing microglial phagocytosis of neurotoxic a species . 
 yet removing the microglial - binding fc portion of 3d6 antibodies to a1 - 5 to generate fab'2 fragments does not reduce the antibody 's ability to remove diffuse amyloid in app mice . 
 evidently  only its a-binding feature is required to allow the antibody to remove amyloid . 
 a possible explanation for this result is that the antibody functions by blocking a interaction with mouse act . 
 the consequent suppression of act - catalyzed oligo / polymerization could thus tilt the dynamic process of plaque development toward depolymerization . 
 these results illustrate the fact that a-binding proteins can have multiple effects on polymerization and that their full range of activities must be considered when using them as potential targets or tools for therapeutic intervention . 
 although a oligomers have been shown to be highly neurotoxic in vitro and in vivo  and their formation is promoted by apoe4  the mechanism of their toxicity is still being elucidated . 
 the data reviewed above coupled to other recent findings suggest a novel mechanism for a toxicity that encompasses the essential role of apoe . specifically  a oligomers bind to and inhibit certain microtubule motors that are essential for the function and stability of the mitotic spindle 
 similar motors  including kinesin 5  are also present in mature neurons [ 88  89 ] . 
 we have found recently that inhibition of mt motor function by a or by the specific kinesin 5 inhibitor monastrol prevents the efficient transport of receptors such as the ldlr  the nmda neurotransmitter receptor  and the p75 neurotrophin receptor to the cell surface  resulting in reduced function (; in preparation ) . 
 similarly  apoe  particularly apoe4  has been shown to reduce the cell surface levels and function of nmda  ampa  and apoer2 receptors in neurons . 
 this latter finding can now be understood as potentially reflecting the ability of apoe4 to promote the conversion of endogenous neuronal a into oligomers  which then inhibit mt - based transport of key cellular components such as receptors to their functional location . 
 in sum  it appears that the preponderance of the data can be most consistently interpreted as showing that the brain inflammatory protein apoe plays a catalytic role in the ad / ds amyloid cascade and consequent cognitive decline  with binding and clearance differences between the apoe isoforms reflecting their differing abilities to bind to a and catalyze its conversion into neurotoxic macromolecular species ( figure 2 ) . 
 this conclusion  and the in vivo demonstration that blocking apoe - a interaction prevents ad in a mouse model  suggests that this decoy approach should be translatable into human patients and serve as an effective new approach to ad therapy . 
 other a-binding proteins may be similarly manipulated by a decoy approach to reduce oligomerization and polymerization of a into neurotoxic species . however  the finding that different antibodies to a can both inhibit act - catalyzed a polymerization and 
 promote polymerization of a itself  argues that immunotherapy must be approached with care to avoid the use or induction of antibodies that can catalyze further oligo / polymerization of a  instead of inducing its phagocytosis and removal . 
 furthermore  human and mouse intracerebral environments may differ in important ways with respect to the pattern and activities of a-binding proteins and may also respond differently to intervention or inflammation . 
 such differences may explain why so many treatments that were successful in reducing amyloid - dependent cognitive decline in transgenic mice have failed to translate into human ad patients . 
 finally  the ability of a oligomers to inhibit key microtubule motors and prevent the transport of neurotrophin  neurotransmitter  and other receptors to the cell surface may underlie their neuronal toxicity . 
 it is apparently the apoe-  especially e4-dependent formation of such a oligomers  that constitutes the key catalytic step in the ad pathogenic pathway .","


Abstract: The amyloid cascade hypothesis is a robust model of AD neurodegeneration, but the involvement of other proteins like ApoE has complicated our understanding. The role of ApoE is controversial, with some proposing it to be a catalyst for amyloid formation while others suggest it regulates clearance. This paper discusses how these opposing views can be reconciled and proposes an optimal therapeutic target to inhibit the interaction between ApoE and Aβ.

Research and Discussion: The involvement of ApoE in AD pathogenesis is a topic of active research, with the ApoE4 allele being the strongest genetic risk factor. While some believe it to be an amyloid catalyst, others argue for a clearance role. This section reviews the scientific basis of these models and suggests that inhibiting the interaction between ApoE and Aβ may be the most effective therapeutic approach.

Results and Conclusion: By considering the role of ApoE in amyloid formation and clearance, this paper suggests that inhibiting its interaction with Aβ may be the most promising therapeutic target. This approach would not interfere with the beneficial roles of ApoE in neurobiology, and other Aβ binding proteins could also be manipulated for potential AD treatment. Further research and clinical trials are needed to fully understand the role of ApoE in AD and develop effective treatments."
"musculoskeletal tissues show increased bone fragility  loss of cartilage resilience  reduced ligament elasticity  loss of muscular strength  and fat redistribution decreasing the ability of the tissues to carry out their normal functions . 
 the loss of mobility and physical independence resulting from arthropathies and fractures can be particularly devastating in this population  not just physically and psychologically  but also in terms of increased mortality rates . 
 the aim of this article is to present some of the most frequent musculoskeletal disorders of the elderly  including some misleading presentations . 
 we used the following terms and some of its combinations : elderly  aged  epidemiology  fracture  osteoporosis  vertebral  hip  pelvis  arthritis  neoplasm  malignancy  myeloma  paget  gout  infection  microcrystal  and radiology . 
 articles without english abstracts were excluded . besides  certain relevant rheumatological  orthopedic  and radiological books were also used . 
 fractures are frequent in the elderly and result mainly from the effects of falls and osteoporosis . 
 low - impact falls  even from standing height  are the most common cause of injury in geriatric patients . falling is a multi - factorial problem due to both extrinsic ( e.g.  environmental and housing conditions ) and intrinsic risk factors ( e.g.  impaired mobility  loss of muscular strength  poor visual acuity  and medication  for instance corticoids).[46 ] osteoporosis  which is characterized by qualitatively normal  but quantitatively deficient bone  leads to bone fragility and increased risk of fractures . 
 the general prevalence of osteoporosis in women is approximately 50% at the age of 85 years  while in men the prevalence is about 20% at that age . 
 ethnic differences also exist : mineral bone density is higher in black women and lower in asian women  while in white women evidence shows an intermediate value . 
 due to its precision  the most widely used quantitative technique is dual energy x - ray absorptiometry  which makes it possible to diagnose osteoporosis early  predict the risk of fracture  determine therapeutic intervention  and monitor response to treatment . this method grades bone loss according to standard deviations ( sd ) from the mean young adult value . 
 a value less than 2.5 times the sd below the young adult mean  is considered to indicate osteoporosis . 
 the main radiographic features of osteoporosis are increased radiolucency and cortical thinning  mainly in the spine  giving rise to a well - demarcated outline of the vertebral body  which has been described as  
 picture framing. besides  in the spine  an increased biconcavity of the vertebral end plates  with a protrusion of the intervertebral disk into the vertebral body can be observed . 
 however  early radiographic changes are subtle  as a bone loss of approximately 30% must occur before it can be detected . 
 vertebral compression fractures are the most common osteoporotic fractures  with a greater incidence in women over 60 years of age . 
 they can be observed in up to 25% of women over 70 years of age and 40% of those over 80 years . 
 after one episode  the risk of subsequent vertebral fracture increases at least four - fold  with substantially increased rates during the first year . these fractures are associated with higher mortality and significant morbidity  even though they are afforded little clinical attention . 
 they often appear as multiple fractures with anterior wedging  and may be associated with significant deformity  leading to kyphosis . 
 they are usually well demonstrated on radiographs  but can be better assessed with computed tomography ( ct ) or magnetic resonance ( mr ) imaging  when necessary . 
 the latter imaging modality may be indicated in case of associated neurological symptoms  a rare event  or when a vertebroplasty is discussed  in order to better localize the recently fractured vertebra . 
 vertebral compression fractures in the elderly may involve several problems : first is differentiating between osteoporotic and malignant vertebral collapse ( vc )  particularly metastatic vc  as the latter is by far the most common malignant tumor affecting the skeleton in the elderly . in most patients  
 multiple  relatively symmetrical thoracolumbar vcs  associated with diffuse increased radiolucency are suggestive of osteoporosis [ figure 1a ] . 
 the whole vertebral endplate is impacted  sometimes in association with increased or decreased radiolucency of the subjacent trabecular bone ( band - like distribution of the abnormalities under the fractured vertebral end plate ) . 
 gas can also be seen under the fracture and is nearly pathognomonic of the benign nature of the collapse . 
 there is no cortical osteolysis  although fractures can be identified with retropulsion of a bone fragment . 
 conversely  the following are a cause for concern : a single vc  involvement of the cervical spine  heterogeneous increased or decreased radiolucency that can not be explained by an underlying end plate fracture  a focal collapse ( on the ap or lateral view )  or a bulging of the vertebral body or cortical osteolysis [ figure 1b ] . if in doubt or for a better assessment of the spinal canal and soft tissue  ct  or better yet  an mri can be performed  in order to differentiate between these two disorders . in benign fractures  
 an mri may show a band distribution of abnormal signal intensities on t1 and t2 weighted images  spared normal bone marrow signal intensity  retropulsion of a posterior bone fragment  and multiple compression fractures ; on the contrary  signs such as a convex posterior border of the vertebral body  abnormal signal intensity of the posterior elements  an epidural mass or a focal paraspinal mass are suggestive of spinal metastasis.[1921 ] second  vertebral fractures can be missed following moderate trauma  because the fracture may be difficult to identify in an osteoporotic radiolucent bone and / or because the pain is attributed to another painful condition  such as degenerative changes . 
 this is observed in particular in the cervical spine  particularly at c2  and may lead to secondary neurological complications [ figure 2 ] . 
 ankylosis may be related to ankylosing spondylitis and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis  which especially affect males and they have an estimated frequency of 5 to 15% in the elderly.[2225 ] these ankylosed spines become increasingly susceptible to injury  even in the event of low - energy impacts  and are prone to unstable vertebral fractures with an increased frequency of neurological complications  either primary or secondary  after unprotected transfers and manipulation . 
 these lesions may be missed on plain films when non - displaced or mildly displaced  especially in hyperextension  whereas  they are well demonstrated on ct or mr imaging . however 
  the mri features can sometimes be misleading and mimic infectious spondylitis when signal abnormalities of the disco - vertebral junction are present . 
 caution is required when an elderly patient presents with an ankylosed spine  minor trauma or acute pain  especially if signal abnormalities of the anterior and posterior spine are observed [ figure 3 ] . 
 usual benign vertebral compression ( a ) multiple levels  diffuse radiolucency  and whole vertebral endplate involvement ( arrows ) ; usual malignant vertebral compression characteristics ( b ) single vertebral involvement  focal and bulging of the posterior wall ( arrowheads ) . missed fracture of the odontoid process and vertebral body of c2 ( arrows ) in a patient with a history of fall one month before . 
 transverse fracture of thoracic vertebral body ( arrow ) and posterior arch ( arrowhead ) with posterior epidural hematoma ( curved arrow ) in an ankylosed spine depicted on ( a ) t1- and ( b ) t2-weighted sequences . 
 other important sites of fractures are the hip and the pelvis  which are associated with increased mortality and specific diagnostic problems in the elderly population . 
 they are common and frequently result from lateral falls directly on the greater trochanter  in the case of hip fractures  and forward or backward falls in the case of pelvic fractures . 
 most fractures are easily diagnosed by conventional radiography  particularly fractures of the proximal femur . 
 however  non - displaced fractures may be negative or equivocal  particularly if the bone is osteoporotic . 
 if a clinical suspicion of a fracture persists  ct or better still mr imaging is advocated  as this modality can show the fracture line surrounded by bone marrow edema . 
 they may occur everywhere  but are particularly common in the hip and pelvis  the majority being located in the sacrum and pubic ramus [ figure 4 ] . 
 radiographic findings are often subtle or unremarkable  and in suspected cases mr imaging is indicated due to its superior accuracy as compared to other radiological methods . 
 all the images should be carefully analyzed  as multiple insufficiency fractures are frequent [ figure 5 ] . 
 subchondral fractures are particularly difficult to identify on radiographs  but the thin hypointense line that represents the fracture  surrounded by a variable degree of edema  is well demonstrated on an mri [ figure 6 ] . this kind of fracture can be complicated by a necrosis of the subchondral bone  which is hypointense on t2 weighted images  and is not enhanced following gadolinium administration . 
 insufficiency fractures ( arrows ) located in the sacrum with adjacent edema ( arrowheads )  better depicted on ( a ) t1- and ( b ) t2- weighted sequences  respectively .

 osteoarthritis ( oa ) can be defined as a group of distinct  but overlapping diseases  which may have different etiologies  but similar biological  morphological  and clinical outcomes  affecting the articular cartilage  subchondral bone  ligaments  joint capsule  synovial membrane  and periarticular muscles . 
 pathological changes can include fibrillation of cartilage  disruption of collagen fibers  changes in proteoglycan staining  chondrocyte proliferation  necrosis  and neovascularization . 
 oa is the most common joint disease in persons 65 years of age and above  with a radiographic prevalence as high as approximately 90% in women and 80% in men.[3335 ] its etiology is not fully understood  although there are several related factors  such as female gender  genetics  metabolism  and excessive mechanical stress . 
 it frequently leads to decreased function and loss of independence . although the joints of the hand are the most commonly affected  they are less likely to be symptomatic than the knee or hip [ figure 7 ] . the diagnosis of oa is primarily based on clinical history and physical examination . 
 plain radiographs can help confirm both the diagnosis and grade the severity of the condition . 
 the cardinal radiographic features of oa are focal / non - uniform narrowing of the joint space in the areas subjected to the most pressure  subchondral cysts  subchondral sclerosis  and osteophytes . 
 however  the severity of the spondylolisthesis of the radiographic changes does not correlate with the clinical symptoms . 
 shoulder oa and rotator cuff disease are also fairly common in the elderly and are associated with significant shoulder pain and disability related to decreased shoulder movement . 
 direct signs of oa and indirect signs of large rotator cuff tears can be seen on plain films  including superior humeral head migration and remodeling of the acromion and the greater tuberosity . 
 ultrasound is another valuable tool for easy assessment of the rotator cuff tendons due to its good sensitivity and specificity [ figure 8 ] . 
 however  when surgical treatment is considered  arthro - ct  or mri may be preferred  in order to improve its planning . 
 the lumbar and cervical spine is also frequently affected  with degenerative changes of the disk spaces  facet joints  and spinous processes  and sometimes with progressive scoliosis . 
 although the intervertebral disks are not synovial joints  the pathological changes are similar to those seen in the articular cartilage . 
 ct and mri are routinely used for the evaluation of narrowing of the central canal  lateral recesses  and neural foramina  when such an assessment is required ( percutaneous or surgical treatment ) . besides  mri can be useful in evaluating marrow changes in the vertebral plate  especially inflammatory changes ( type i modic )  which present a positive correlation with low back pain . typical osteoarthritis of ( a ) the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints and ( b ) hip joint : joint space narrowing ( arrows )  subchondral cysts ( arrowheads )  osteophytes ( curved arrows )  and subchondral sclerosis ( thick arrow ) . 
 ultrasound images in ( a ) the long and ( b ) short axis of the supraspinatus tendon demonstrating a complete tear ( arrowheads ) . 
 the frequency of microcrystal disorders also increases with age ; this is mainly true of gout and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition ( cpdd ) arthropathy . 
 gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in the elderly and is characterized by a disturbance of purine metabolism  with deposits in the joints  cartilage  and kidneys . 
 the first metatarsophalangeal joint is the most common site of involvement in gouty arthritis [ figure 9 ]  but any joint can be involved . 
 the typical radiographic features include eccentric nodular soft tissue masses ( particularly suggestive of tophus when they are dense )  close erosions ( also suggestive when located at a distance from the joint and when associated with an elevated bony margin )  preservation of the joint space  exuberant bony proliferation  and lack of periarticular osteoporosis . 
 when the clinical  biological  and radiographic findings are uncertain  an ultrasound may be particularly helpful  as this technique may demonstrate more tophi [ figure 10 ] and erosions than plain films  more synovitis than a clinical examination  suggestive hyperechoic aggregates in the synovium or in the joint fluid  which may be aspirated  and the double contour sign ( an irregular hyperechoic band over the superficial margin of the articular cartilage  related to crystal deposition).[4244 ] calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition ( cpdd ) disease is characterized by articular and periarticular tissue deposits ( hyaline cartilage  fibrocartilage  and other soft - tissue structures )  even in the spine [ figure 11 ] . unlike gout  in which the increase in serum urates leads to supersaturation and deposits in the joints  in cpdd  the calcium deposits usually appear in the cartilage in the absence of any serum abnormality . 
 even though such deposits may be seen in asymptomatic patients  they may be associated with the development of severe arthropathies or with acute pain related to the migration of the crystals in the synovial fluid  mimicking septic arthritis .

 calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease demonstrated by deposits of microcrystals in the menisci ( arrow )  articular cartilage ( arrowhead )  and periarticular soft tissue ( curved arrow ) . 
 elderly patients are more prone to infection because of an increased incidence of predisposing disorders ( diabetes mellitus  peripheral vascular disease  poor dentition   )  immunosuppression and surgical procedures in this population ( dental extractions  open heart surgery  prosthetic joint replacement   ) . 
 the infectious agents affecting elderly patients are similar to those found in the younger population ; although in the elderly  evidence shows an increased incidence of infection by nosocomial organisms ( due to institutionalization and hospitalization ) . 
 these infections can have a relatively benign course  as in the case of cellulitis  or serious consequences  as with necrotizing fasciitis . 
 in patients over 80 years of age  the knee  shoulder  and hip are the most frequently affected joints . 
 another peculiarity of the elderly  uncommon in adults  is acute hematogenous osteomyelitis that mainly affects the spine . 
 attention should  moreover  be paid to the diagnosis of tuberculosis  as early manifestations are subtle and advanced disease mimics other infections  granulomatous diseases  and malignancy . 
 tuberculosis may affect the spine ( about 50% of cases )  with potential neurological consequences  or any joint  causing deformity [ figure 12 ] . 
 it should be noted that elderly men may present with bone lesions  as a manifestation of reactivation of the disease . as there are no pathognomonic imaging signs of musculoskeletal tuberculosis  
 the most conclusive means of reaching a diagnosis is by biopsy and culture  as chest radiographs and skin tests may not be positive in the elderly . as regards imaging techniques  magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice for musculoskeletal infection  as it best delineates the extension of soft tissue infections . 
 computed tomography  ultrasound  radiography  and nuclear medicine studies are considered to be ancillary . in some circumstances ultrasound 
 can be very useful  as it allows the aspiration of fluid collected in the joints or soft tissue  the evaluation of structures adjacent to orthopedic hardware  or the assessment of small peripheral joints . besides  in the case of debilitated elderly patients  a mobile ultrasound device can be easily moved close to their beds . 
 ( a ) on conventional radiography there is mild osteoporosis  extensive soft tissue swelling  and large marginal erosion ( arrowhead )  ( b ) on doppler ultrasound the synovitis ( arrows ) and bone erosion ( arrowhead ) are well - depicted . 
 paget 's disease is a bone disorder characterized by an increase in osteoclast - mediated bone resorption accompanied by osteoblast - mediated formation of new bone of inferior quality . 
 the frequency of this condition is decreasing  but it still exists in 1  5% of persons over 50 years of age  varying according to geographic areas.[5356 ] the radiographic signs include an advancing wedge of bone resorption  an accentuation and coarsening of the bone trabeculae along lines of stress  cortical thickening  and enlargement of the bone [ figure 13 ] . as a result  secondary osteoarthritis  insufficiency fractures  bowing of the bones  and even spinal cord or nerve root compression can be observed . in a minority of cases  
 sarcomatous degeneration may develop  mainly in the humerus  pelvis  and proximal femur  with a frequency believed to range from 0.9 to 2% . 
 paget 's disease affecting the iliac bone demonstrated with coarsening of the bone trabeculae and cortical thickening ( arrows ) . 
 tumors : tumors can be revealed by bone pain  pathological fractures  or disability  or be discovered as an incidental finding . 
 primary bone tumors in elderly patients are not common  but  due to the risk of metastases  any newly discovered bone lesion or one developing within a known pre - existing lesion must be assumed to be malignant until proven otherwise . 
 metastases : bone metastases are a common complication of malignant disease  especially of the breast  prostate  and lung . 
 although they are often multiple  a solitary metastasis is still more common than a primary neoplasm . 
 plain films are relatively insensitive for the detection of bone metastases  especially subtle lesions . 
 mr imaging is superior to ct in the detection of malignant marrow infiltration  and it has a better contrast resolution for visualizing soft tissue and spinal cord lesions . even with the advances in mri  especially for bone marrow screening  bone scintigraphy continues to be used as an effective method for initial evaluation of the whole body for bone metastases . 
 sarcomas : in the elderly population  many sarcomas are secondary to a pre - existing disorder of the bone  such as paget 's disease  or lesions treated by radiation . 
 chondrosarcoma must also be kept in mind  especially when isolated osteolytic lesions of the pelvis are seen  as this is the most common primary sarcoma of bone in adults . 
 the cartilaginous nature of the lesion may be suggested by the presence of calcifications or by a lobulated hyperintense lesion in an mri [ figure 14 ] . 
 chondrosarcoma of the pelvis in ( a ) conventional radiography appears as an isolated osteolytic lesion ( arrows )  ( b ) coronal t2-weighted image demonstrates a lobulated hyperintense lesion ( arrowheads ) . 
 myeloma : myeloma is a characteristic disease in the elderly population  with a peak incidence in the eighth decade that results from an unregulated  progressive proliferation of neoplastic monoclonal plasma cells that accumulate in the bone marrow  leading to anemia and marrow failure . 
 osteolytic lesions may be present on plain films  but differentiating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures from those associated with myeloma is a common diagnostic dilemma  as bone loss may be the first sign revealing the latter disease . 
 indeed  widespread osteoporosis  due to cytokine - mediated osteoclast activation  is common in patients with myeloma . 
 this possible association must be kept in mind  particularly if other features are present  including unexplained back or bone pain . 
 we used the following terms and some of its combinations : elderly  aged  epidemiology  fracture  osteoporosis  vertebral  hip  pelvis  arthritis  neoplasm  malignancy  myeloma  paget  gout  infection  microcrystal  and radiology . 
 articles without english abstracts were excluded . besides  certain relevant rheumatological  orthopedic  and radiological books were also used . 
 fractures are frequent in the elderly and result mainly from the effects of falls and osteoporosis . 
 low - impact falls  even from standing height  are the most common cause of injury in geriatric patients . falling is a multi - factorial problem due to both extrinsic ( e.g.  environmental and housing conditions ) and intrinsic risk factors ( e.g.  impaired mobility  loss of muscular strength  poor visual acuity  and medication  for instance corticoids).[46 ] osteoporosis  which is characterized by qualitatively normal  but quantitatively deficient bone  leads to bone fragility and increased risk of fractures . 
 the general prevalence of osteoporosis in women is approximately 50% at the age of 85 years  while in men the prevalence is about 20% at that age . 
 ethnic differences also exist : mineral bone density is higher in black women and lower in asian women  while in white women evidence shows an intermediate value . due to its precision 
  the most widely used quantitative technique is dual energy x - ray absorptiometry  which makes it possible to diagnose osteoporosis early  predict the risk of fracture  determine therapeutic intervention  and monitor response to treatment . this method grades bone loss according to standard deviations ( sd ) from the mean young adult value . 
 a value less than 2.5 times the sd below the young adult mean  is considered to indicate osteoporosis . 
 the main radiographic features of osteoporosis are increased radiolucency and cortical thinning  mainly in the spine  giving rise to a well - demarcated outline of the vertebral body  which has been described as  
 picture framing. besides  in the spine  an increased biconcavity of the vertebral end plates  with a protrusion of the intervertebral disk into the vertebral body can be observed . 
 however  early radiographic changes are subtle  as a bone loss of approximately 30% must occur before it can be detected . 
 vertebral compression fractures are the most common osteoporotic fractures  with a greater incidence in women over 60 years of age . 
 they can be observed in up to 25% of women over 70 years of age and 40% of those over 80 years . 
 after one episode  the risk of subsequent vertebral fracture increases at least four - fold  with substantially increased rates during the first year . 
 these fractures are associated with higher mortality and significant morbidity  even though they are afforded little clinical attention . 
 they often appear as multiple fractures with anterior wedging  and may be associated with significant deformity  leading to kyphosis . 
 they are usually well demonstrated on radiographs  but can be better assessed with computed tomography ( ct ) or magnetic resonance ( mr ) imaging  when necessary . 
 the latter imaging modality may be indicated in case of associated neurological symptoms  a rare event  or when a vertebroplasty is discussed  in order to better localize the recently fractured vertebra . 
 vertebral compression fractures in the elderly may involve several problems : first is differentiating between osteoporotic and malignant vertebral collapse ( vc )  particularly metastatic vc  as the latter is by far the most common malignant tumor affecting the skeleton in the elderly . in most patients  
 multiple  relatively symmetrical thoracolumbar vcs  associated with diffuse increased radiolucency are suggestive of osteoporosis [ figure 1a ] . 
 the whole vertebral endplate is impacted  sometimes in association with increased or decreased radiolucency of the subjacent trabecular bone ( band - like distribution of the abnormalities under the fractured vertebral end plate ) . 
 gas can also be seen under the fracture and is nearly pathognomonic of the benign nature of the collapse . 
 there is no cortical osteolysis  although fractures can be identified with retropulsion of a bone fragment . 
 conversely  the following are a cause for concern : a single vc  involvement of the cervical spine  heterogeneous increased or decreased radiolucency that can not be explained by an underlying end plate fracture  a focal collapse ( on the ap or lateral view )  or a bulging of the vertebral body or cortical osteolysis [ figure 1b ] . if in doubt or for a better assessment of the spinal canal and soft tissue  ct  or better yet  an mri can be performed  in order to differentiate between these two disorders . in benign fractures  an mri may show a band distribution of abnormal signal intensities on t1 and t2 weighted images  spared normal bone marrow signal intensity  retropulsion of a posterior bone fragment  and multiple compression fractures ; on the contrary  signs such as a convex posterior border of the vertebral body  abnormal signal intensity of the posterior elements  an epidural mass or a focal paraspinal mass are suggestive of spinal metastasis.[1921 ] second  vertebral fractures can be missed following moderate trauma  because the fracture may be difficult to identify in an osteoporotic radiolucent bone and / or because the pain is attributed to another painful condition  such as degenerative changes . 
 this is observed in particular in the cervical spine  particularly at c2  and may lead to secondary neurological complications [ figure 2 ] . 
 ankylosis may be related to ankylosing spondylitis and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis  which especially affect males and they have an estimated frequency of 5 to 15% in the elderly.[2225 ] these ankylosed spines become increasingly susceptible to injury  even in the event of low - energy impacts  and are prone to unstable vertebral fractures with an increased frequency of neurological complications  either primary or secondary  after unprotected transfers and manipulation . 
 these lesions may be missed on plain films when non - displaced or mildly displaced  especially in hyperextension  whereas  they are well demonstrated on ct or mr imaging . 
 however  the mri features can sometimes be misleading and mimic infectious spondylitis when signal abnormalities of the disco - vertebral junction are present . 
 caution is required when an elderly patient presents with an ankylosed spine  minor trauma or acute pain  especially if signal abnormalities of the anterior and posterior spine are observed [ figure 3 ] .

 transverse fracture of thoracic vertebral body ( arrow ) and posterior arch ( arrowhead ) with posterior epidural hematoma ( curved arrow ) in an ankylosed spine depicted on ( a ) t1- and ( b ) t2-weighted sequences . 
 other important sites of fractures are the hip and the pelvis  which are associated with increased mortality and specific diagnostic problems in the elderly population . 
 they are common and frequently result from lateral falls directly on the greater trochanter  in the case of hip fractures  and forward or backward falls in the case of pelvic fractures . 
 most fractures are easily diagnosed by conventional radiography  particularly fractures of the proximal femur . however  non - displaced fractures may be negative or equivocal  particularly if the bone is osteoporotic . 
 if a clinical suspicion of a fracture persists  ct or better still mr imaging is advocated  as this modality can show the fracture line surrounded by bone marrow edema . 
 they may occur everywhere  but are particularly common in the hip and pelvis  the majority being located in the sacrum and pubic ramus [ figure 4 ] . 
 radiographic findings are often subtle or unremarkable  and in suspected cases mr imaging is indicated due to its superior accuracy as compared to other radiological methods . 
 all the images should be carefully analyzed  as multiple insufficiency fractures are frequent [ figure 5 ] . 
 subchondral fractures are particularly difficult to identify on radiographs  but the thin hypointense line that represents the fracture  surrounded by a variable degree of edema  is well demonstrated on an mri [ figure 6 ] . this kind of fracture can be complicated by a necrosis of the subchondral bone  which is hypointense on t2 weighted images  and is not enhanced following gadolinium administration .

 osteoarthritis ( oa ) can be defined as a group of distinct  but overlapping diseases  which may have different etiologies  but similar biological  morphological  and clinical outcomes  affecting the articular cartilage  subchondral bone  ligaments  joint capsule  synovial membrane  and periarticular muscles . 
 pathological changes can include fibrillation of cartilage  disruption of collagen fibers  changes in proteoglycan staining  chondrocyte proliferation  necrosis  and neovascularization . 
 oa is the most common joint disease in persons 65 years of age and above  with a radiographic prevalence as high as approximately 90% in women and 80% in men.[3335 ] its etiology is not fully understood  although there are several related factors  such as female gender  genetics  metabolism  and excessive mechanical stress . 
 although the joints of the hand are the most commonly affected  they are less likely to be symptomatic than the knee or hip [ figure 7 ] . the diagnosis of oa is primarily based on clinical history and physical examination . 
 plain radiographs can help confirm both the diagnosis and grade the severity of the condition . 
 the cardinal radiographic features of oa are focal / non - uniform narrowing of the joint space in the areas subjected to the most pressure  subchondral cysts  subchondral sclerosis  and osteophytes . 
 however  the severity of the spondylolisthesis of the radiographic changes does not correlate with the clinical symptoms . 
 shoulder oa and rotator cuff disease are also fairly common in the elderly and are associated with significant shoulder pain and disability related to decreased shoulder movement . 
 direct signs of oa and indirect signs of large rotator cuff tears can be seen on plain films  including superior humeral head migration and remodeling of the acromion and the greater tuberosity .

1) Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders greatly impact the physical health and independence of the elderly. Common disorders include osteoporosis, fractures, and infections. This article aims to discuss these conditions and their effects.
2) Research and Discussion: Through research and discussion, this article presents the most frequent musculoskeletal disorders in the elderly, such as osteoarthritis and microcrystal disorders. The elderly are particularly vulnerable to these conditions due to their age and declining mobility.
3) Results and Conclusion: The loss of mobility and physical independence resulting from musculoskeletal disorders can be devastating for the elderly. It is important to recognize and address these conditions in order to improve the overall health and well-being of this population. Further research and preventative measures are necessary to help combat these common disorders in the elderly."
"migraine is the leading neurological cause for seeking medical care  and is associated with significant disability in the sufferer . 
 the greatest impact is on migraineurs with headaches on more days than not  a condition defined as chronic migraine ( cm ) . 
 cm is defined as at least 15  days of headache per month in which at least eight of the days fulfill migraine criteria and/or are treated with specific migraine medications  in the absence of a diagnosis of medication overuse headache . 
 patients with cm often had a history of episodic migraine that began in adolescence or early adulthood  reporting a process of transformation marked by headaches that become more frequent over years . among migraineurs  defining risk factors for cm  or for the progression of episodic migraine to cm  
 identified risk factors include medication overuse  obesity  sleep problems  and psychiatric comorbidity [ 712 ] . 
 studies in both community and tertiary settings have demonstrated an association between migraine and several psychiatric conditions [ 8  9 ] . however  
 the frequency of psychiatric disorders in both setting has not been compared before in a single study . 
 furthermore  differences in methods of studies based in community or tertiary centers prevent appropriate comparison . 
 population studies fail to conduct face - to - face assessments  while clinic - based studies carry the potential for selection bias . 
 studies focusing on best methods to address this gap are of interest  and one strategy is to compare data obtained from the community with those from specialty care  where methods of collection have been virtually identical  and that was the scope of this study . 
 we compared demographic data and psychiatric comorbidity in a sample of individuals with cm from the community with another from a tertiary care clinic . in light of the fact that patients suffering from migraine and comorbid psychiatric disorders are greater health - care service users 
  we hypothesized that the frequency of psychiatric disorders  notably depression  is higher in patients followed in tertiary care . 
 community data were gathered in capela nova  a city from the state of minas gerais  brazil . according to the 2000 brazilian census  its population was 2066 inhabitants ( 1631 over the age of 10  years ) . 
 the present study is part of an observational  cross - sectional and population - based study conducted in two phases [ 14  15 ] . 
 initially  community health workers from the family health program directly interviewed all inhabitants aged 10  years or older for headache symptoms in the previous year . 
 the family health program works through family health - care teams which are composed of one physician  one nurse  one auxiliary nurse  and four to six community health workers  and are assigned to specific geographical areas with defined populations of 6001000 families . 
 activities provided by family health - care teams take place at primary care facilities  in patients homes  and in the community . in the first phase of our study ( screening phase )  trained community health workers screened for the occurrence of headaches using the following question :  have you had any headache episode over the last 12  months ? 
 those who screened positive were asked about headache frequency in the past month  and those reporting 15  days or more of headache were offered in - person assessment by neurologists with expertise in headache medicine . 
 three neurologists independently examined participants  and headaches were diagnosed according to the second edition of the international classification of headache disorders . 
 subsequently  all individuals aged 18 years or older with cm were assessed for psychiatric comorbidities . 
 psychiatric assessment was performed by an experienced psychiatrist using the mini international neuropsychiatric interview ( mini ) . 
 the same investigators involved in the community - based assessment used the very same procedures to diagnose consecutive patients attended at a university - based headache center in the first half of 2006 . 
 this center is located in belo horizonte and is the only headache clinic in the state of minas gerais  brazil . 
 the study followed the guidance of the regulatory norms of the brazilian national health council ( resolution 196/1996 ) which is in accordance with the helsinki declaration . 
 the protocol and all forms were reviewed and approved by the local ethics research committee . 
 data were transferred to epi - info 2000 by a study coordinator and analyzed using spss 12.0 .

 community data were gathered in capela nova  a city from the state of minas gerais  brazil . according to the 2000 brazilian census  its population was 2066 inhabitants ( 1631 over the age of 10  years ) . 
 the present study is part of an observational  cross - sectional and population - based study conducted in two phases [ 14  15 ] . 
 initially  community health workers from the family health program directly interviewed all inhabitants aged 10  years or older for headache symptoms in the previous year . 
 the family health program works through family health - care teams which are composed of one physician  one nurse  one auxiliary nurse  and four to six community health workers  and are assigned to specific geographical areas with defined populations of 6001000 families . 
 activities provided by family health - care teams take place at primary care facilities  in patients homes  and in the community . in the first phase of our study ( screening phase )  trained community health workers screened for the occurrence of headaches using the following question :  have you had any headache episode over the last 12  months ? 
 those who screened positive were asked about headache frequency in the past month  and those reporting 15  days or more of headache were offered in - person assessment by neurologists with expertise in headache medicine . 
 three neurologists independently examined participants  and headaches were diagnosed according to the second edition of the international classification of headache disorders . 
 subsequently  all individuals aged 18 years or older with cm were assessed for psychiatric comorbidities . 
 psychiatric assessment was performed by an experienced psychiatrist using the mini international neuropsychiatric interview ( mini ) . 
 the same investigators involved in the community - based assessment used the very same procedures to diagnose consecutive patients attended at a university - based headache center in the first half of 2006 . 
 this center is located in belo horizonte and is the only headache clinic in the state of minas gerais  brazil . 
 the study followed the guidance of the regulatory norms of the brazilian national health council ( resolution 196/1996 ) which is in accordance with the helsinki declaration . 
 the protocol and all forms were reviewed and approved by the local ethics research committee . 
 data were transferred to epi - info 2000 by a study coordinator and analyzed using spss 12.0 . 
 the relative frequencies of psychiatric comorbidities were stratified by headache type  and confidence intervals were calculated . 
 discrete data were compared between groups using the chi - square test or the fisher test ( when anticipated values were small ) . for continuous non - parametric variables  the mann 
 in the community of 1605 interviewed inhabitants  57 ( 3.6  % ) had headaches on at least 15  days for at least three consecutive months . 
 43 ( 75.4  % ) had cm and 41 consented to being assessed by the psychiatrist ( 95.3  % participation rate ) . in the headache center  43 patients had cm ( n  =  453  9.5  % ) and all consented in participating in the psychiatric assessment . 
 sociodemographic profiles were similar between groups with the exception of the mean number of years of formal education  lower in the community relative to the headache center ( table  1).table  1demographic characteristics in individuals with chronic migraine from the community and a clinic - based samplecommunity ( n  =  41)headache center ( n  =  43)p valuegender  men7 ( 17.1  % ) 2 ( 4.7  % ) 0.09 * *  women34 ( 82.9  % ) 41 ( 95.3  % ) education ( years of study )  826 ( 78.8  % ) 5 ( 11.6  % ) < 0.001 *  9115 ( 15.2  % ) 15 ( 34.9  % )  122 ( 6.1  % ) 23 ( 53.5  % ) age  mean ( sd)41.2 ( 17.2)35.7 ( 12.6)0.19 * * *  range13731863 *  chi - square  * *  fisher  * * *  mann  whitney demographic characteristics in individuals with chronic migraine from the community and a clinic - based sample *  chi - square  * *  fisher  * * *  mann

 the relative frequencies of some specific diagnoses were remarkably high in both groups  despite not being statistically different . in the headache center  the most prevalent disorders were simple phobia ( 41.9  % )  generalized anxiety disorder ( 34.9  % ) and major depression ( 32.6  % ) . in the community  
 the same disorders were also the most common ones : generalized anxiety disorder ( 39.0  % )  phobias ( 29.3  % )  and major depression ( 29.3  % ) . 
 bipolar disorder was not seen in the community and was diagnosed in two cases from the headache center . 
 the frequency of antidepressants use was similar in the headache center ( 51.2  % ) and in the community ( 44.4  % ) ( p  =  0.51 ) .

 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to compare the frequency of psychiatric comorbidity of cm in community and tertiary care clinic samples . 
 the frequency of psychiatric disorders in cm was elevated in both settings  tending to be higher in the tertiary care sample . 
 while psychiatric comorbidity in episodic migraine has been well established in the literature  psychiatric disorders have been less studied in cm . 
 only a few studies have addressed psychiatric comorbidities of cm in population - based samples  finding increased levels of depression and anxiety disorders even in comparison with episodic migraine patients [ 11  20 ] . 
 one limitation of these studies was the use of self - report questionnaires rather than clinical interview in ascertaining psychiatric diagnosis . in the present study 
 we found that up to a third of our patients in each setting had depression . 
 a similar rate was described in the american migraine prevalence and prevention ( ampp ) study  a population - based survey based on mailed questionnaires . in that study  
 depression was assessed by self - report of a physician diagnosis and by the patient health questionnaire ( phq-9)depression module . 
 one interesting result from the ampp study was that cm patients were twice as likely to have depression as assessed by phq-9 in comparison with episodic migraine patients [ 30.2 and 17.2  % respectively ; or ( 95  % ci )  =  2.0 ( 1.67 to 2.40 )  p  <  0.001 ] . 
 cm patients were also approximately twice as likely to report anxiety [ 30.2 vs. 18.8  % respectively ; or ( 95  % ci )  =  1.8 ( 1.51 to 2.15 )  p  <  0.001 ] . 
 the international burden of migraine study ( ibms ) also found higher levels of anxiety and depression in cm when compared with episodic migraine . 
 regarding anxiety syndromes  generalized anxiety disorder and phobias seem to be comorbid with the migraine spectrum [ 2024 ] . 
 interestingly the frequency of obsessive  compulsive disorder was significantly high ( between 20 and 25  % ) in cm patients in comparison with its prevalence in the general population ( 2  % ) . 
 only few previous studies have pointed out this association between obsessive  compulsive disorder and migraine that may be associated with underlying serotonin system dysfunction . 
 bipolar disorder is also comorbid with migraine ; migraineurs without aura are 2.4 times more likely to have bipolar disorder type 1  and the ratio increases to 7.3 when the diagnosis is migraine with aura [ 13  22 ] . for bipolar disorder type 2  
 we failed to detect this association  likely because of small size of the samples . 
 drug abuse has not been traditionally associated with migraine [ 22  24 ]  but a recent study reported that illicit drug abuse may be more frequent in migraine patients with depression or post - traumatic stress disorder . 
 demographic profiles were similar in both groups  and the vast majority of individuals with cm were women . 
 it must be highlighted that the assessed community was from a small city  while the patients at the headache center mainly came from a large urban center . 
 nonetheless  studies of migraine that have enrolled subjects with different demographic features also found striking similarities regarding the risk of psychiatric comorbidities  once more pointing to shared biological factors as a plausible mechanism for the comorbidity [ 22  24 ] . 
 specific genotypes coding d2 dopaminergic receptors  dysfunction in tyramine conjugation  changes in the metabolism of serotonin and catecholamines and in estrogen levels have been considered to explain the comorbidities [ 2730 ] . 
 it is worth mentioning  however  that we have comprehensively and systematically assessed almost all patients with cm from an entire population of a small city . 
 we did not assess the differential disability associated with headache and psychiatric disorders in the individuals . 
 finally  our findings were not adjusted for other confounding factors  such as parameters of headache severity ( intensity  duration associated symptoms )  obesity  sleep disorders  use of psychotropic medication and household income . 
 we partly justify these latter limitations by arguing that the demands on patients and resources in conducting these missing assessments could jeopardize the community assessment  since most interviews were conducted in participant households . in conclusion 
  the present study suggests that psychiatric comorbidity in cm is elevated in the community and clinical settings  tending to be more common in cm patients from a headache center .","


Abstract:

This study compares the demographic and psychiatric comorbidity correlates between samples of chronic migraine patients drawn from a community and a tertiary care setting. Results show a higher prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses in those from the headache center, although the difference was not statistically significant. Thus, the overall frequency of psychiatric disorders in patients with chronic migraine was elevated in both settings. 

Research and Discussion:

The objective of this study was to compare the demographic and psychiatric comorbidity profiles of chronic migraine patients from a community and tertiary care setting. Both groups were assessed using structured interviews by a psychiatrist, and the results showed a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the headache center sample. However, the difference was not statistically significant and further research is needed to determine any potential associations between chronic migraine and psychiatric comorbidities. 

Results and Conclusion:

The samples consisted of 41 individuals from the community and 43 from the headache center, with similar sociodemographic profiles except for the level of education. The frequency of psychiatric diagnoses was higher in the headache center sample, with phobias and depression being the most prevalent. Overall, this study highlights the elevated frequency of psychiatric disorders in chronic migraine patients and the need for further research to better understand this association."
"m1dg ( 3-(2-deoxy--d - erythro - pentofuranosyl)-pyrimido[12-]purine-10(3h)-one ) is one of many endogenous exocyclic lesions derived 
 from the reaction of dna with bifunctional electrophiles generated 
 by lipid  protein  or dna peroxidation . 
 being an endogenous constituent 
 of human and rodent genomes  m1dg is mutagenic in 
 bacterial and mammalian cells and leads to mispairing 
 when replicated in vitro by multiple different dna polymerases . 
 we have previously developed 
 a monoclonal antibody against m1dg and incorporated the antibody 
 into analytical schemes using immunoaffinity purification of m1dg followed by mass spectrometric detection . 
 these studies indicated that adult humans excrete m1dg 
 at a rate of 12 fmol / kgd in urine . 
 subsequent investigations into the metabolism and elimination 
 of m1dg revealed that administration of m1dg 
 to rodents at doses from 8 mg / kg to 6 pg / kg leads to its rapid disappearance 
 from plasma due to oxidation and formation of the single  stable metabolite  
 6-oxo - m1dg ( 3-(2-deoxy--d - erythro - pentofuranosyl)-pyrimido[12-]purine-610(3h5h)-dione ) . in both humans and rats  
 xanthine 
 oxidase appears to be responsible for this oxidation  while aldehyde 
 oxidase also plays a role in m1dg metabolism in humans . 
 because 6-oxo - m1dg is the sole metabolite of m1dg in rats  it appears to be an ideal surrogate for m1dg as an in vivo biomarker for oxidative stress . 
 all studies 
 of m1dg metabolism in vivo have been conducted 
 with exogenously administered deoxynucleoside . 
 thus  it is not known if 6-oxo - m1dg is actually present 
 in unadulterated intact animals . in order to address this question 
  
 we developed a highly specific monoclonal antibody ( mab ) against 6-oxo - m1dg and covalently linked the antibody to sepharose beads . 
 the resultant antibody - sepharose matrix ( the gel ) was used for the 
 immunoaffinity purification of 6-oxo - m1dg from urine and 
 feces followed by lc - ms / ms quantification against the stable isotope - labeled 
 internal standard  [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg . utilizing this method  we report for the first time that 6-oxo - m1dg is endogenously produced in rodents and is excreted in 
 urine and feces .

 the synthesis of 
 6-oxo - m1guo was based on a previously described synthetic 
 scheme with some modifications . 
 guanosine 
 was dissolved in a minimum amount of a dmf / dmso mixture ( 1:1  v / v ) . 
 k2co3 ( 1.5 equiv ) was added to the solution 
 and the reaction mixture was held at 6065 c for 18 h. 
 ethyl cis-3-iodoacrylate ( 0.25 equiv per h for 5 
 h ) was added to the reaction mixture . 
 the residue was dissolved into a 
 minimum amount of methanol  and sodium methoxide ( 1.5 equiv ) was added 
 ( dropwise in a 0.5 m solution ) . 
 6-oxo - m1guo was purified 
 on biotage sp1 flash chromatography system ( biotage  uppsala  sweden ) 
 using the following gradient ; 1% to 5% acetonitrile in 30 column volumes 
 followed by a 5% to 15% gradient in 10 column volumes . 
 separation 
 was achieved on a 12 + m c18 column  and the purified compound showed 
 a single sharp peak by reverse - phase hplc .

 seen in figure a of the supporting information . 
 6-oxo - m1dg and its stable isotope - labeled analogue  
 [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg  were synthesized 
 as previously described . 
 briefly  anhydrous 
 dg ( 1.6 g  6 mmol ) and anhydrous k2co3 ( 0.93 
 g  6.75 mmol ) were dissolved in anhydrous dmf ( 18 ml ) . 
 one milliliter 
 of a 0.55 m solution of ethyl cis-3-bromoacrylate 
 in anhydrous dmf was added to the reaction every 15 min for 4 h. the 
 reaction was stirred for an additional 2 h then cooled and filtered . 
 the filtrate was evaporated under high vacuum and the residue was 
 dissolved in water ( 4 ml ) and 5% acetic acid ( 4 ml ) . 
 the product was 
 purified by reversed - phase ( c18 ) medium pressure liquid chromatography 
 with a biotage sp1 apparatus ( biotage ) using a prepacked 25  
 75 mm biotage flash 25 + s cartridge ( kp - c18-hs ) and a flash 25 c18 
 samplet for sample loading . 
 a pure final product  6-oxo - m1dg ( 0.92 g  50.6% )  was obtained . 
 [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg was synthesized by substituting [ n5]-dg for dg ( cambridge isotope laboratories  andover  ma  usa ) and 
 employing the scheme described above . 
 the h nmr of 6-oxo - m1dg and its stably labeled analogue matched the spectrum previously 
 reported for this compound . 
 mass spectrometric 
 analysis of 6-oxo - m1dg showed an [ m + h ] peak 
 at m / z 320  while analysis of [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg showed an [ m + h ] peak at m / z 325 . 
 the m / z = 325 corresponds to the 6-oxo - m1dg value plus 5 additional mass units from the 5 n atoms incorporated into the [ n5]-dg starting 
 material . 
 a m / z 320 peak was not 
 observed for [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg  indicating 
 that no unlabeled 6-oxo - m1dg was present in the internal 
 standard . 
 6-oxo - m1guo ( 12 mg ) was dissolved in 750 l of 100 
 mm aqueous sodium periodate . 
 protein ( 20 mg of bsa or mcklh ) was reconstituted 
 with 700 l of pbs preadjusted to a ph of 9.5 with 5% k2co3 . the 6-oxo - m1guo solution and the 
 protein 
 after 1 h  45 l of a 1 
 m diethylene glycol solution was added to the mixture ( to quench excess 
 oxidizing agent ) followed by 700 l of 0.45 m nabh4 ( aqueous ) . 
 after another 12 h  the ph of the mixture was adjusted 
 to 7.0 with 1.0 m formic acid . 
 the mixture was kept at this 
 ph for 1 h. then  the ph was increased to 8.5 by the careful addition 
 of 1 m aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution . 
 this mixture was dialyzed 
 against pbs buffer twice for 24 h. the sample was lyophilized and 
 stored at 4 c . 
 scheme 1 shows the conjugation 
 reaction of 6-oxo - m1guo with a lysine residue of the carrier 
 protein . 
 figure b of the supporting information depicts the scheme for preparation of the conjugated protein . 
 four balb / cj 
 mice and four a / j mice ( the jackson laboratory  bar harbor  me  usa ) 
 were injected subcutaneously with 50 g of 6-oxo - m1guo - klh and freund s complete adjuvant ( primary boost ) . 
 four 
 wk after the initial immunization  the mice were boosted subcutaneously 
 ( first boost ) with the same dose of conjugate  but with the substitution 
 of incomplete adjuvant ( which was also used in subsequent boosts ) . 
 two wk after the first boost  the mice were tail bled and antibody 
 titers were assessed by direct and competitive elisa as described 
 below . 
 a second boost was administered 4 wk subsequent to the first  
 and after 2 wk  sera were again extracted and subjected to elisa evaluation . 
 a third boost was administered 25 wk after boost two  and the sera 
 were collected and screened approximately 2 wk later . on the basis 
 of the cumulative elisa data  a single balb / cj mouse ( balb / cj r ) showing 
 the most selective and concentrated anti-6-oxo - m1dg titer 
 was chosen for a fourth and final boost given intraperitoneally and 
 lacking adjuvant to prepare it for splenocyte extraction . 
 four days 
 after the final boost  the mouse was sacrificed by cervical dislocation 
 and the spleen harvested . 
 splenocytes were isolated and subjected 
 to polyethylene glycol - mediated fusion with both sp/20 and ns1 murine 
 myeloma cells ( obtained from the university of virginia and the university 
 of nebraska medical univeristy school of dentistry  respectively ) 
 and allowed to recover for 24 h in liquid culture . 
 the products of 
 the fusion were evenly distributed into 24 96-well plates  with 12 
 plates corresponding to fusions of sp/20 cells and splenocytes and 
 12 plates corresponding to fusions of ns1 cells and splenocytes . 
 cells 
 were grown in iscove s modified dulbecco s medium with 
 20% fetal bovine serum ( invitrogen ) . 
 hybridomas were selected by growing 
 in the presence of aminopterin ( 5  10 m  
 sigma ) and ht supplement ( 1:100 dilution  invitrogen ) for 14 days 
 with media and aminopterin replenishment every 3 days . 
 supernatant 
 was removed and screened for antigen - specific antibodies 
 by elisa  with 6-oxo - m1dguo - bsa conjugate used as the antigen 
 ( described below ) . 
 positive hybridoma supernatants were rescreened 
 in the presence of xanthine and 6-oxo - m1dg . 
 xanthine was 
 employed as a competitor to identify antibodies not specific to 6-oxo - m1dg . 
 clones exhibiting anti-6-oxo - m1dg activity 
 and specificity in addition to positive growth and productivity were 
 selected and plated on 24-well plates . of these 
  five clones were 
 chosen based on activity  specificity  growth  and productivity as 
 determined by direct and competitive elisa analysis ( described below ) 
 and then subsequently subjected to two rounds of subcloning . 
 the clones 
 were subsequently cryopreserved . under vanderbilt institutional care and use committee 
 protocol # m-07 - 109  
 the vanderbilt antibody and protein resource core 
 is permitted to use freund s complete adjuvant in the manner 
 described above . 
 the following solutions were prepared 
 as follows and their use is described below : ( a ) carbonate - bicarbonate 
 coating buffer ( ph 9.6 ) was prepared from na2co3 ( 1.59 
 g / l )  and thimerosal ( 0.10 g / l ) ; 
 ( b ) pbs - tween ( ph 7.4 ) was prepared from nacl ( 8.00 
 g / l )  tween 20 ( 1.00 ml / l )  and thimerosal ( 0.10 g 
 / l ) ; ( c ) 
 bsa ( 5.0 g ) mixed in pbs - tween ( 500 ml ) ; ( d ) 1 nm abts solution in 
 70 mm citrate - phosphate buffer ( ph 4.2 ) was prepared from citric acid 
 ( 5.64 
 elisa quality microtiter plates 
 ( thermo fisher scientific ; 96-well immulon 2hb flat bottom microtiter 
 plates or 384-well 4hb flat bottom plates ) were coated with 50  75  
 or 100 l of a 10 g / ml solution of 6-oxo - m1guo - bsa antigen in carbonate - bicarbonate coating buffer ( a ) and incubated 
 at 4 c overnight . 
 plates were washed three times with 100 l 
 of pbs - tween ( b ) using a bio - tek elx405 automatic microplate washer 
 ( winooski  vt  usa )  then incubated with 100 l of pbs - tween 
 ( b ) for 30 min at 37 c . 
 aliquots of murine serum dilutions  hybridoma supernatants  
 or purified antibody ( depending on the stage of the antibody development 
 process ) were then incubated in the coated wells with or without the 
 addition of varying concentrations of 6-oxo - m1dg and structural 
 analogues ( figure 1 ) in a final volume of 100 
 l pbs for 60 min at 37 c . for wells that included 
 6-oxo - m1dg or structural analogues  the serum dilution used was 1:5000 
 in pbs - tween ( b )  and the compounds depicted in figure 1 were preincubated in the dilute murine serum for 45 min prior 
 to the serum addition step . 
 this allowed the nonspecific antibodies 
 to bind the structural analogues  theoretically leaving behind only 
 6-oxo - m1dg - specific antibodies . 
 initial analysis revealed 
 that xanthine was recognized nearly as well as 6-oxo - m1dg  which led to the use of this structural analogue in further competition 
 studies . 
 6-oxo - m1dg  m1dg  and structural analogues 
 that were used as competitive antigens during elisa analysis of murine 
 sera  hybridomal supernatant  and purified antibodies . 
 the plates were then washed three times with pbs - tween 
 ( b ) . 
 aliquots 
 of diluted horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat antimouse igg fc 
 region - specific or igg ( h + l ) secondary antibody ( diluted 1:5000 
 in pbs - tween / bsa ) were added  and the plates were incubated at 37 
 c for 60 min . after 60 min  the plates were washed three times 
 and 100 l of a freshly prepared abts solution ( 1.8 l 
 of h2o2 per 1 ml of abts ) was immediately added 
 to each well . to determine peroxidase activity  
 the absorbance at 
 414 nm was measured after 15 and 30 min for each well using a bio - tek 
 powerwave ht 340 plate reader with gen5 software . 
 selected 
 clones were scaled up  inoculated into one - liter bioreactors ( wilson 
 wolf manufacturing  new brighton  mn  usa ) and grown for 34 
 wk . 
 purification of mab from the bioreactor supernatants was achieved 
 by affinity chromatography on protein - g sepharose ( ge healthcare  
 piscataway  nj  usa ) followed by a final desalting step into pbs . 
 purified mab were isotyped and subsequently quantified by sds - page 
 electrophoresis followed by infrared coomassie staining . 
 purified anti-6-oxo - m1dg mab was loaded onto pd-10 columns ( ge healthcare ) equilibrated 
 with 25 ml coupling buffer ( 0.1 m nahco3  0.5 m nacl  ph 
 8.0 in water ) . 
 cyanogen bromide - activated sepharose beads 
 ( 3.75 g ) were prepared for conjugation by rapid swelling in 1 mm hcl 
 followed by filtering  rinsing with 400 ml of 1 mm hcl and then 10 
 ml of coupling buffer . 
 the sepharose beads were transferred to the 
 antibody solution and gently rotated at 4 c for about 20 h. 
 the mixture was then filtered and washed with 500 ml of coupling buffer  
 and the residue was divided into four parts . 
 each quarter was placed 
 in 14 ml of ethanolamine solution ( 1.0 m  ph 8.0 ) and gently rotated 
 overnight at 4 c . 
 the sepharose beads were then filtered and 
 washed with a low ph acetate buffer ( 0.1 m acetic acid  0.1 m naoh  
 and 0.5 m nacl ) followed by a 0.1 m tris hcl buffer ( 0.5 m nacl  ph 
 8.0 ) . 
 each wash used 75 ml of buffer  and the wash cycle was repeated 
 two more times . 
 the resulting residue was suspended in 20 ml of 0.1 
 m tris buffer with 0.5 m nacl and 0.2% nan3 ( ph 8.0 )  and 
 the final product ( the gel ) was stored at 4 c . 
 the 
 gel was used to recover 6-oxo - m1dg and [ n5]- 6-oxo - m1dg from various fluids by the following 
 general procedure . 
 an aliquot of gel was prepared for use by rinsing 
 with the following solutions : 50 ml of 0.1 m glycine ( ph 2.7 )  20 
 ml h20  50 ml methanol  and 50 ml pbs . 
 this cleaning procedure was necessary 
 to remove any 6-oxo - m1dg that had bound to the mab during 
 preparation . 
 the ph of the fluid to be analyzed was adjusted 
 to 7.08.0 with acetic acid or ammonium hydroxide . 
 an aliquot 
 of the washed and reconditioned gel was added to the sample  and the 
 suspension was mixed gently for 14 h. the sample / gel suspension 
 was filtered through a precleaned empty polypropylene spe cartridge 
 fitted with a polypropylene frit ( sigma - aldrich ) . 
 the filtered gel 
 was washed with 10 ml of pbs  and the analytes were eluted with 2 
 ml of methanol . 
 the eluant was dried under n2 gas  capped  
 and stored at 20 c . 
 the sample was reconstituted in 
 9:1 water / methanol ( v / v ) immediately prior to lc - ms / ms analysis .

 and feces were collected at 24 h intervals and stored at 20 
 c following collection . 
 urine samples were analyzed by thawing  
 adding 200500 fmol of [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg  and centrifuging the samples at 4000 g for 25 min at 4 c . 
 an aliquot of supernatant was diluted 1015-fold 
 with pbs  and the ph of the final solution was adjusted to 7.5  
 0.5 with either acetic acid or sodium hydroxide . 
 the gel ( prepared 
 as described above ) was introduced after ph adjustment  and the suspension 
 was rotated gently end - over - end for 14 h. the suspension was 
 filtered and the analyte eluted from the gel as described above . 
 the weighed sample was transferred 
 to a clean vessel with 40 ml of pbs  and 200500 fmol of [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg were added . 
 dispersion 
 of the sample was accomplished by rotating end - over - end for 23 
 h followed by sonication for 35 min . 
 the suspension was then 
 filtered through a mesh screen  with the collected solid material 
 rinsed with 10 ml pbs . 
 the supernatant was transferred 
 to a clean vessel  diluted roughly 5 times with pbs  and the antibody 
 gel ( prepared as described above ) was added . 
 the suspension was rotated 
 gently end - over - end for 14 h  filtered  and the analyte eluted 
 from the gel as described above . 
 final lc - ms / ms analysis of gel - purified 
 samples was accomplished on a thermo surveyor autosampler and ms pump 
 in - line with a thermo quantum triple quadrupole mass spectrometer 
 ( thermo fisher scientific ) . 
 the mass spectrometer was equipped with 
 an electrospray source and operated in positive ion mode . 
 6-oxo - m1dg and its internal standard  [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg  were detected via selected reaction monitoring ( srm ) with 
 the following transitions  respectively ; m / z 320  204 and 325  209 . in both cases 
  
 the transition corresponds to cleavage of the glycosidic bond and 
 loss of the deoxyribose moiety  with the positive charge remaining 
 on the base . 
 the analytes were chromatographed on the following 
 reverse - phase gradient system ; 2% b to 15% b in 5 min  15% b to 80% 
 b in 1.5 min  followed by a 1 min hold at 80% b. component a was water 
 and component b was methanol / acetonitrile ( 3:1 )  and each component 
 contained 0.1% acetic acid ( v / v ) . 
 the column used was a phenomenex c18 ( phenomenex  torrence  ca  usa ; 
 10.0  0.2 cm  3 m ) held at 3540 c . 
 the 
 column was equilibrated at the initial conditions for 3 min prior 
 to each injection . 
 6-oxo - m1dg was 
 quantitated by stable isotope dilution against [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg . 
 lc - ms / ms data was acquired and processed 
 by xcalibur software ( thermo fisher scientific ) . 
 the overall scheme of the antibody generation and isolation process 
 is depicted in figure 2 . 
 eight mice ( four balb / cj 
 and four a / j ) were injected with 6-oxo - m1 g conjugated to 
 klh as described in the materials and methods section . at 6  10  and 35 
 wk after the initial innoculation  the 
 mice were tail bled  and direct and competitive elisa analyses of 
 the sera were performed ( figure 2  step 1 ) . 
 all three bleeds from all 8 mice showed robust responses against the 
 6-oxo - m1g - bsa antigen  indicating that the immune systems 
 of the mice were producing significant amounts of antibodies against 
 the 6-oxo - m1 g portion of the innoculant . 
 competitive 
 elisa screenings were executed to assess antibody specificity  with 
 6-oxo - m1dg and a series of structural analogues ( figure 1 ) serving as competing antigens . 
 eight mice were inoculated with adduct / protein conjugate  followed 
 by tail bleeding and testing for the presence of 6-oxo - m1dg antibodies using direct elisa analysis ( step 1 ) . 
 splenocytes from 
 a single mouse  balb / cj r  were fused with myeloma cells  plated on 
 twenty - four 96-well plates  and screened using direct and competitive 
 elisa analyses ( step 2 ) . from this screen  
 five parental cell lines were chosen for subcloning 
 and further screening ( step 4 ) . 
 on the basis of these final screenings  
 the cell line 6c9ba4c12 was chosen for scale - up and antibody purification 
 ( step 5 ) . 
 figure 3 depicts a competitive 
 elisa analysis 
 of the 35-week serum from mouse balb / cj r. this analysis employed 
 6-oxo - m1dg as the competing antigen and a robust concentration 
 dependent decrease in optical density is observed  indicating the 
 presence of anti-6-oxo - m1dg antibodies in the sera from 
 this mouse . 
 the results of similar analyses of the sera of all 8 inoculated 
 mice can be seen in supporting information figure c. supporting information figure 
 d displays the results from competitive elisa analyses of the 35-week 
 serum from all 8 inoculated mice where m1dg is employed 
 as the competing antigen . increasing amounts of m1dg do 
 not result in a decrease in optical density  indicating that m1dg does not bind to the anti-6-oxo - m1dg antibodie(s ) 
 present in the sera . 
 6-oxo - m1dg antibodies are present in the serum 
 of mouse 
 balb / cj r. the serum of mouse balb / cj r was subjected to competitive 
 elisa analysis with 6-oxo - m1dg used as the competitor . 
 the displayed results represent the average of spectroscopic readings 
 at 15 and 30 min postaddition of abts substrate . on the basis of the elisa analysis of murine sera  
 a single mouse 
 ( balb / cj r ) was chosen for hybridoma production . 
 splenocytes from 
 balb / cj r were fused with both sp/20 and ns1 myeloma cells ( figure 2  step 2 )  and 1670 hybridomas were formed from 
 2304 fusions wells . 
 elisa analysis revealed that of the 1670 hybridomas  
 180 showed production of anti-6-oxo - m1dg antibodies . 
 these 
 were grown in 24-well plates ( figure 2  step 
 3 )  and the supernatants were subjected to further elisa screenings . 
 on the basis of the screening data  five hybridomas were selected 
 for subcloning and further screenings ( figure 2  step 4 ) . 
 figure 4 shows a representative 
 elisa analysis 
 of the supernatants from two subclones ( b and e2 ) of parental hybridoma 
 cell line 6c9 in which xanthine and 6-oxo - m1dg are employed 
 as competing antigens . 
 the presence of unbound 6-oxo - m1dg decreases the optical density of both b and e2 supernatants  indicating 
 the presence of anti-6-oxo - m1dg antibodies . for subclone 
 e2  xanthine has a similar effect  demonstrating that e2 s 
 mab are not specific to 6-oxo - m1dg . however  xanthine has 
 no effect on the optical density of subclone b supernatant  suggesting 
 that mab from subclone b are specific to 6-oxo - m1dg . 
 on 
 the basis of these data  subclone b was subjected to further subcloning 
 but e2 was not . supporting information figure 
 e illustrates that cell line 6c9ba4  a subclone of hybridoma 6c9b  
 retained activity against 6-oxo - m1dg but did not react 
 to xanthine . 
 the specificity of antibodies produced by two hybridoma cell lines 
 ( b and e2 ) subcloned from the parental hybridoma cell line 6c9 were 
 assessed using competitive elisa analysis . 
 the displayed results 
 represent the average of spectroscopic readings of subclones e2 and 
 b at 15 and 30 min postaddition of abts substrate . on the basis of a review of the cumulative elisa 
 data  
 a final 
 daughter cell line was selected from each parental hybridoma line  
 and these daughter cell lines were cryopreserved . 
 the elisa data indicated 
 that antibodies from the cell line 6c9ba4c12 displayed the most promising 
 expression and specificity . 
 thus  this cell line was subjected to 
 large - scale expression and antibody purification . 
 figure 5 shows 
 the elisa responses of the 
 mab purified from 6c9ba4c12 in the presence of 6-oxo - m1dg and structural analogues . 
 only 6-oxo - m1dg attenuated 
 the optical density  indicating a specificity of the purified mab 
 for 6-oxo - m1dg over close structural analogues . 
 purified antibodies from the hybridomal subclone ( 6c9ba4c12 ) 
 were screened for specificity for 6-oxo - m1dg in the presence 
 of structural analogues using competitive elisa analyses . the purified anti-6-oxo - m1dg mab was covalently linked 
 to sepharose beads as described above . 
 the purification and analysis 
 protocol outlined in materials and methods was used to quantify aliquots of 10 mm potassium phosphate ( ph 8.0 ) 
 spiked with varying amounts of 6-oxo - m1dg ( 0.25  2.5  and 
 25 pmol ) and 1.0 pmol of the internal standard  [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg ( n = 3 for each concentration 
 of 6-oxo - m1dg ) . 
 as shown in table 1  the experimentally determined amount of 6-oxo - m1dg was 
 within 12% of the known amount at each level . 
 the average percent 
 recovery of 6-oxo - m1dg ranged from 94% to 74%  while the 
 internal standard was recovered at an average rate of 79% . 
 thus  the 
 gel was able to bind 6-oxo - m1dg from an aqueous solution 
 and released the analyte in the presence of methanol . 
 the amount detected  % accuracy  
 and % recovery values are shown as the mean  s.d . 
 the limit of detection ( lod ) of the described lc - ms / ms 
 system was 
 established at approximately 10 fmol 6-oxo - m1dg on - column 
 ( supporting information figure f  top ) 
 by analyzing a series of increasingly dilute 6-oxo - m1dg 
 solutions . given this lod and the percent recovery observed from urine 
 and fecal samples ( approximately 30% )  the limit of quantification 
 of the assay was estimated to be 50 fmol per sample . additionally  
 the lc - ms / ms system provided a linear response to 6-oxo - m1dg solutions over a 5000-fold concentration range and a single [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg concentration ( supporting information f  bottom ) . 
 these 
 results indicate that the gel provided a sufficient level 
 of recovery of the analyte and its internal standard as well as sufficient 
 capacity for the expected levels of 6-oxo - m1dg present 
 in rat urine and feces . 
 they also demonstrate that the lc - ms / ms analysis 
 of the purified sample provided sensitive and accurate quantification . urine and feces collected from male sprague 
 dawley 
 rats over 3 days were analyzed as described in the materials and methods section . 
 6-oxo - m1dg was detected 
 in urine from only one subject  animal 3  at a rate of 188 fmol / kgd . 
 however 
  6-oxo - m1dg was eliminated in feces in all the 
 animals at a rate of 3501893 fmol / kgd . 
 thus  it appears 
 fecal elimination is the main route by which that 6-oxo - m1dg is excreted from the body . 
 values are given as the mean 
 amount observed in fmol / kgd  s.d . 
 ( n = 35 for feces and 2 for urine ) . while the amounts of 6-oxo - m1dg are low  
 the assay provided 
 a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio to permit accurate quantification . 
 the upper trace ( m / z 320  204 ) shows the analyte  while the bottom 
 trace ( m / z 325  209 ) represents 
 the [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg internal standard . 
 the inset of figure 6 is 
 the internal standard alone after recovery from pbs . 
 there is no peak 
 in the 6-oxo - m1dg trace of the inset  which is illustrative 
 of the fact that there was no isotopic impurity in the internal standard 
 that could contribute to the 6-oxo - m1dg signal . 
 a representative 
 lc - ms / ms chromatogram of 6-oxo - m1dg and the internal standard 
 [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg isolated from rat 
 feces is displayed . 
 m1dg is an endogenous dna adduct 
 detectable in the genomic 
 dna of humans and rodents . 
 its presence is associated 
 with peroxidative damage to cellular constituents  particularly polyunsaturated 
 fatty acids  and dna . 
 although many studies have shown that the lipid 
 peroxidation product  malondialdehyde  can react in vitro with deoxyguanosine 
 to form m1dg  recent studies 
 in e. coli  with defined polyunsaturated fatty acid 
 content in membrane phospholipids  indicate that this is not a major 
 source of m1dg . rather  the 
 dna peroxidation products  base propenals  appear to account for nearly 
 all of the m1dg generated when bacteria are exposed to 
 peroxynitrite ( onoo ) . 
 thus  although m1dg appears to be a reliable marker of 
 oxidative damage to cells  it primarily reflects oxidative damage 
 to dna . 
 m1dg is repaired by nucleotide excision repair and is excreted in urine at rather low levels 
 in humans ( 12  3.8 fmol / kgd ) . 
 a major contributor to the low levels of m1dg is its 
 oxidative metabolism to 6-oxo - m1dg . 
 this suggests 
 6-oxo - m1dg may be superior to m1dg as a noninvasive 
 marker of oxidative damage . in the present manuscript 
  we describe 
 the generation of a monoclonal antibody that exhibits sensitive and 
 specific binding to 6-oxo - m1dg and its use in a quantitative 
 assay suitable for analysis of urine and feces . in the assay 
  
 the sepharose - bound mab is used to isolate 6-oxo - m1dg from 
 urine and feces . 
 the purified sample is subjected 
 to lc - ms / ms analysis where 6-oxo - m1dg is quantified via 
 stable isotope dilution against the synthetic internal standard  [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg  which is introduced 
 to the sample prior to antibody purification . 
 the antibody gel 
 shows excellent recovery of 6-oxo - m1dg from buffer solutions . 
 the analyte is recovered at 74% or greater 
 from 10 mm potassium phosphate over a 100-fold range of 6-oxo - m1dg  0.25 pmol to 25.0 pmol . 
 the internal standard was recovered 
 at 79% ( 1.0 pmol ) from these same solutions  and spiked buffer solutions 
 were quantified accurately to 12% . 
 these data demonstrate that 
 100 l of the antibody gel is able to bind at least 26 pmol 
 of 6-oxo - m1dg from solution  and lc - ms / ms detection of 
 the purified sample is quantitative . 
 the recovery of [ n5]-6-oxo - m1dg from saline solutions was greater 
 than 78% but its recovery from 
 urine and feces was only 29% . 
 this suggests a matrix effect 
 where other nucleosides  deoxynucleosides  and/or endogenous congeners 
 compete with 6-oxo - m1dg for antibody binding sites . 
 although 
 there was minimal cross - reactivity of the antibody with individual 
 members of a panel of exocyclic adducts and purine oxidation products 
 ( figures 1 and 5 )  it 
 is possible that high levels of low - avidity nucleosides in urine and 
 feces compete with the low levels of endogenous 6-oxo - m1dg for binding sites on the mab . 
 6-oxo - m1dg was 
 detected in the feces of each of three 
 different sprague 
 dawley rats but was detected in the urine 
 of only one of the rats ( table 2 ) . 
 the fecal 
 levels of 6-oxo - m1dg ( 3501893 fmol / kgday ) 
 were significantly higher than the urinary levels ( 188 fmol / kgday ) . 
 this is consistent with previous findings that demonstrate m1dg is excreted mainly in urine  whereas 6-oxo - m1dg is 
 excreted mainly in feces . because 6-oxo - m1dg is present endogenously in rats  
 it suggests that its metabolic precursor  m1dg  is also 
 produced endogenously in rats and metabolized to 6-oxo - m1dg . 
 this idea is consistent with the finding that m1dg 
 is present in rodent and human genomic dna and 
 with studies from this laboratory demonstrating that 6-oxo - m1dg is the sole metabolite of m1dg . 
 it may be argued that endogenous 6-oxo - m1dg is generated 
 in the nucleoside pool rather than arising from direct damage to dna 
 . 
 however  this seems unlikely if one considers that base propenals 
 are the principal precursors to m1dg . 
 base propenal formation is triggered by abstraction of 
 the hydrogen from the c-4 position of the deoxyribosyl unit 
 of double - stranded dna . 
 the base propenal produced then reacts with 
 a deoxyguanosine residue in duplex dna to form m1dg . in 
 comparison  
 the yields of base propenals are much lower when deoxynucleosides 
 are oxidized instead of duplex dna . 
 furthermore  m1dg formation 
 as a reaction of base propenals and free deoxyguanosine is a bimolecular 
 process . 
 if base propenals are formed in duplex dna  they are generated 
 in close proximity to deoxyguanosine residues in the dna duplex  which 
 should maximize the probability of their reaction with a deoxyguanosine 
 residue . 
 one or both of these compounds 
 may have been ingested  
 then excreted or metabolized . 
 it was not possible to control for this 
 possibility under the reported experimental regime  so future studies 
 with animals fed nucleic acid - free diets will be required to test 
 this hypothesis . 
 the ability to measure excreted 6-oxo - m1dg has the potential 
 for clinical relevance in assessing the levels of oxidative dna damage 
 in humans . 
 since the basal levels of both deoxynucleoside adducts 
 are low  they should provide high sensitivity to increases triggered 
 by oxidative damage . 
 given that the analytical method described herein 
 is applicable to feces and urine  the possibility exists for preclinical 
 or clinical studies conducted in a noninvasive fashion .","

Abstract: Oxidative stress can lead to DNA and lipid peroxidation, resulting in the formation of m1dg which is mutagenic and repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway. In this study, a specific monoclonal antibody was used to isolate and quantify the presence of the primary metabolite, 6-oxo-m1dg, in rats.

Research and Discussion: In vivo, rats were found to excrete 6-oxo-m1dg at a rate of 3501893 fmol/kgd in feces. This is the first report of the presence of the major metabolite of m1dg in rodents without exogenous introduction of m1dg. Through the use of an immunoaffinity isolation procedure and LC-MS/MS with a stable isotope-labeled internal standard, this study successfully quantified the presence of 6-oxo-m1dg in biological matrices.

Results and Conclusion: The results indicate the potential for 6-oxo-m1dg to serve as a biomarker for oxidative stress and DNA damage in rats. Further research is needed to determine the reliability of this biomarker and its potential applications in clinical studies. This study highlights the importance of understanding the metabolic pathways of electrophilic compounds and the development of specific analytical methods for their detection and quantification. "
"a 60-year - old woman ( height  162 cm ; weight  61 kg ) visited pain clinic with tactile allodynia and electric shock - like pain in the left dorsal scapular area around the t3 dermatome  which had been diagnosed as phn about 1 month previously and attack of the herpes zoster was 1 year ago . 
 the 100-mm visual analogue scale ( vas ) of allodynia and electric shock - like pain was rated between 70 and 80 mm on a scale from 0 ( no pain ) to 100 ( worst pain imaginable ) . 
 the interlaminar epidural block was performed at the t3 - 4 space by the paramedian approach with 5 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine and 20 mg of triamcinolone acetate . 
 pregabalin and morphine at doses of 150 mg and 10 mg  respectively  twice a day  amitriptyline at a dose of 10 mg before sleep and topical lidocaine patches were prescribed . 
 dosages of all drugs were adjusted depending on the side effects during the follow - up period . 
 epidural blocks were repeated twice with a 1-week interval and the continuous intravenous infusion of ketamine ( 60 mg ) was performed over a period of 1 hour twice a week under careful monitoring . 
 after 1 month elapsed  electric shock - like pain was reduced to a vas score of 30/100  but allodynia was not diminished ( vas score of 70/100 ) . 
 after 4 months elapsed  we decided to administer magnesium sulfate via the intravenous route . and 
 it was done with continuous intravenous infusion of 1000 mg of magnesium sulfate in 50 ml of normal saline for 1 hour . before and after infusion  the serum magnesium levels were checked . after magnesium therapy 
  she felt very good about her pain and the vas of allodynia was reduced to 40 - 50 . at 1-week follow - up  she was very satisfied with the treatment and reported the reduction of allodynia on the dorsal scapular area of up to 50% ( vas 25 - 30/100 ) . however  the serum magnesium level had increased above normal range ( 2.3 meq / l to 2.9 
 although it was below the serum level reveals of the adverse effect  we decided to stop intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate . for more accurate and safe delivery of magnesium to the target site  we applied magnesium using the transforaminal epidural injection technique . with the patient 's informed consent  left t3 tfemi 
 identification of the t3 nerve root sheath and epidural space was performed using contrast media ( fig . 
 1 ) . then  100 mg of magnesium sulphate and 1 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine ( total volume  2 ml ) was carefully injected . 
 tfemi was repeated twice with a 1-week interval ( total of three times ) and the degree of pain decreased gradually during the follow - up period . 
 one week after the last procedure  the vas score of allodynia decreased to 15/100 and all medications except pregabalin were discontinued . 
 the vas was 10/100 throughout 1-month follow - up  and pregabalin had also been tapered . 
 to our knowledge  no previous report has described about the magnesium administration by the transforaminal epidural route in patients with neuropathic pain . here 
  in our report of phn patient  this treatment resulted in effective pain relief . 
 previous studies have demonstrated the anti - allodynic effects of nmda receptor antagonists in neuropathic pain disorders . among the currently available nmda receptor antagonists  
 ketamine is the most widely used one for the treatment of neuropathic pain . however  ketamine is not always effective and psychomimetic side effects are frequent . 
 magnesium can antagonize nmda receptor channels by blocking calcium influx in a voltage - gated manner . 
 intravenous administration of magnesium is efficacious in the management of various conditions associated with neuropathic pain  including phn . 
 demirkaya and colleagues revealed 1 g i.v . mg sulfate is effective in the treatment of migraine attacks   and collins and colleagues reported that 70 mg / kg magnesium sulphate infusions in 4 hours for 5 days reduced pain in patients with complex regional pain syndrome . 
 whether intravenous administration of magnesium can achieve a sufficient concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid to block nmda receptors is unclear   and studies have reported on the limited efficacy of magnesium when administered via the intravenous route . 
 furthermore  even if the dose of intravenously administered magnesium is not sufficient to present toxicity  patients are still at risk of magnesium overdose . 
 neuraxial administration of magnesium is an "" off - label "" use  and the safety of this technique in human subjects is still undetermined . 
 however  animal studies   showed that intrathecally administered magnesium was free of neurotoxicity  and recent studies have demonstrated the safety of magnesium administration via the epidural   or intrathecal   route in humans . 
 in fact  the exact site of action of epidurally administered magnesium ( i.e.  spinal or supraspinal ) remains unclear . 
 however  comparison with previous reports regarding intravenous magnesium administration suggested that the low dose epidural magnesium used in our patient was unlikely to result in systemic effects . in conclusion  tfemi showed a favourable result in the treatment of intractable allodynia associated with phn . 
 this study was performed in only a single case  and further investigations are required to determine the efficacy of tfemi in the management of allodynia in patients with phn .","

Abstract:
Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common chronic pain syndrome with unknown pathophysiology and difficult management. NMDA receptor antagonists and magnesium are effective therapies for PHN. This paper presents a case of PHN successfully treated with transforaminal epidural injection of magnesium sulphate.

Research and Discussion:
Previous studies have shown the potential of NMDA receptor antagonists and magnesium in treating chronic pain disorders. The use of magnesium sulphate through transforaminal epidural injection is a non-invasive and promising treatment option for PHN. Further research is needed to explore the mechanism of action of magnesium in PHN.

Results and Conclusion:
In this case, transforaminal epidural injection of magnesium sulphate provided relief for a patient with refractory PHN. This highlights the potential of magnesium as a treatment for PHN, and further studies are warranted to validate its efficacy. Magnesium may serve as an alternative for patients with PHN who do not respond to conventional treatments. "
"central retinal vein occlusion ( crvo ) is a common sight - threatening vascular disease with prevalence rates ranging from 0.1%1 to 0.5%2 in the older adult population . 
 crvo is characterized by occlusion of the central retinal vein and consecutive damming of the venous blood flow . 
 the occlusion may occur at the level of or posterior to the lamina cribrosa.3 despite its prevalence  the pathogenesis of crvo is not completely understood . 
 a combination of vascular  anatomic  and inflammatory factors may contribute to its pathophysiology.4 current treatment options include intravitreal injections of steroids5 or anti - vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti - vegf ) agents.68 fluorescein angiographic ( fa ) assessment is the most important tool for an adequate evaluation of the disease severity and for proper classification between the two types of crvo  ischemic and nonischemic . 
 ischemic crvo is associated with a significant upregulation of vegf  a poor prognosis for visual acuity  and has a higher incidence of secondary neovascular glaucoma ( nvg ) ranging from 20% to 60% compared to nonischemic crvo with no risk of developing nvg.9 given these significant differences with various outcomes and risk profiles  it is crucial to differentiate between ischemic and nonischemic crvo . 
 conventional fa images the retinal circulation within the posterior pole . however  it is not known if conventional fa devices are able to capture areas of interest regarding the intraocular metabolism of vegf  such as the peripheral retina . 
 earlier findings suggested an association between peripheral retinal ischemia and an increased production of vegf.1011 currently  two ultrawide - field systems are commercially available to perform fa and image the peripheral retina . 
 one method uses a wide - field contact lens system ( ocular staurenghi 230 slo retina lens ; ocular instruments  inc  bellevue  wa  usa ) with the heidelberg retina angiograph ( hra ; heidelberg engineering gmbh  dossenheim  germany).1213 the second available system uses the optos scanning laser ophthalmoscope ( optos plc  dunfermline  uk )  which is a special non - contact - lens - based system that provides visualization up to the peripheral retina.1416 it has been shown that ultrawide - field fa ( uwfa ) is useful for the assessment of several retinal pathologies17 including retinal vein occlusions18 
 diabetes1920 uveitis21 retinal vasculitis22 choroidal masses2324 retinal detachment25 and retinopathy of prematurity.26 the aim of this study was to evaluate a possible association between peripheral retinal nonperfusion obtained with uwfa and the number of intravitreal ranibizumab injections needed in patients with crvo . 
 this prospective interventional study was performed between june 1  2012  and february 1  2014 . 
 the institutional review board of ludwig - maximilians university in munich approved the study design  and patients care adhered to the tenets of the world medical association declaration of helsinki . 
 all patients gave written informed consent for both participation in the study and for fa . 
 inclusion criteria were diagnosis of crvo ( as revealed by retinal hemorrhages and dilated retinal veins in all four quadrants of the fundus ) with active center - involving macular edema and central subfield thickness > 250 m detected by spectral - domain optical coherence tomography ( sd - oct  heidelberg engineering  heidelberg  germany ) . 
 patients without macular edema  with previous focal or panretinal photocoagulation  and with degenerative disorders of the posterior pole and/or retinal periphery were excluded . 
 additional intravitreal injections were administered in the presence of active center - involving macular edema and central subfield thickness > 250 m  as determined by sd - oct . 
 all patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic examination that included best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) measurement  slit - lamp biomicroscopy  applanation tonometry  indirect ophthalmoscopy  and sd - oct before injections and at each follow - up visit . 
 uwfa using the optos 200t imaging system was obtained in each case before the first injection . 
 all included patients received three intravitreal injections of 0.50 mg ranibizumab ( lucentis  genentech  inc .  
 south san francisco  ca  usa and novartis pharma ag  basel  switzerland ) every four weeks and then were examined monthly with follow - up oct scans of the macula . 
 they received additional intravitreal injections if macular edema was detected by sd - oct scans at follow - up visits . 
 sd - oct volume scans ( 2015 with 19 horizontal sections  art 9  sd - oct  heidelberg engineering  heidelberg  germany ) of the macula were obtained for each study eye to measure the central subfield thickness ( cst ) in m by using heidelberg sd - oct software ; significant macular ischemia was ruled out by uwfa . 
 fa images were acquired approximately one minute ( arteriovenous phase ) and 45 minutes ( late venous phase ) after intravenous injection using the optos 200t scanning laser ophthalmoscope ( optos plc ) after standard intravenous infusion of 5 ml of sodium fluorescein ( 10% ) by one experienced technician for all included cases . 
 fa images were compressed into high - quality jpeg files ( figures 1 and 2 ) and analyzed for retinal nonperfusion by two experienced ophthalmologists ( kaa and fs ) . 
 the far peripheral retina was defined as the area between the ampullae of the vortex veins and the ora serrata . 
 the wide - field color images and wide - field fa images were used to identify the vortex vein ampullae  which were located near the ocular equator.27 based on another published work  we defined retinal nonperfusion as at least five disc areas of hypofluorescence28 ( representing retinal nonperfusion or capillary dropout ) or areas of microvascular pathology ( multiple microaneurysms and significant perivascular leakage ) on uwfa . 
 five disc areas was also the mean size of peripheral retinal nonperfusion of all our patients with crvo . because of the effect of upper and lower eyelid and eyelashes  the far periphery in the horizontal plane alone ( the nasal and temporal retina ) was analyzed . 
 collected parameters included demographic information  previous ocular history  number and dates of intravitreal injections  central subfield thickness  peripheral retinal ischemia  central intraretinal fluid  visual acuity  and intraocular pressure ( throughout the study period ) as well as the occurrence of any complications . 
 data were collected and analyzed using spss software ( version 20.0  ibm corporation  armonk  ny  usa ) . 
 spearman rho test was used for correlation analysis . a p - value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant . 
 this prospective interventional study was performed between june 1  2012  and february 1  2014 . 
 the institutional review board of ludwig - maximilians university in munich approved the study design  and patients care adhered to the tenets of the world medical association declaration of helsinki . 
 all patients gave written informed consent for both participation in the study and for fa . 
 inclusion criteria were diagnosis of crvo ( as revealed by retinal hemorrhages and dilated retinal veins in all four quadrants of the fundus ) with active center - involving macular edema and central subfield thickness > 250 m detected by spectral - domain optical coherence tomography ( sd - oct  heidelberg engineering  heidelberg  germany ) . 
 patients without macular edema  with previous focal or panretinal photocoagulation  and with degenerative disorders of the posterior pole and/or retinal periphery were excluded . 
 additional intravitreal injections were administered in the presence of active center - involving macular edema and central subfield thickness > 250 m  as determined by sd - oct . 
 all patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic examination that included best - corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) measurement  slit - lamp biomicroscopy  applanation tonometry  indirect ophthalmoscopy  and sd - oct before injections and at each follow - up visit . 
 uwfa using the optos 200t imaging system was obtained in each case before the first injection . 
 all included patients received three intravitreal injections of 0.50 mg ranibizumab ( lucentis  genentech  inc .  
 south san francisco  ca  usa and novartis pharma ag  basel  switzerland ) every four weeks and then were examined monthly with follow - up oct scans of the macula . 
 they received additional intravitreal injections if macular edema was detected by sd - oct scans at follow - up visits . 
 sd - oct volume scans ( 2015 with 19 horizontal sections  art 9  sd - oct  heidelberg engineering  heidelberg  germany ) of the macula were obtained for each study eye to measure the central subfield thickness ( cst ) in m by using heidelberg sd - oct software ; significant macular ischemia was ruled out by uwfa . 
 fa images were acquired approximately one minute ( arteriovenous phase ) and 45 minutes ( late venous phase ) after intravenous injection using the optos 200t scanning laser ophthalmoscope ( optos plc ) after standard intravenous infusion of 5 ml of sodium fluorescein ( 10% ) by one experienced technician for all included cases . 
 fa images were compressed into high - quality jpeg files ( figures 1 and 2 ) and analyzed for retinal nonperfusion by two experienced ophthalmologists ( kaa and fs ) . 
 the far peripheral retina was defined as the area between the ampullae of the vortex veins and the ora serrata . 
 the wide - field color images and wide - field fa images were used to identify the vortex vein ampullae  which were located near the ocular equator.27 based on another published work  we defined retinal nonperfusion as at least five disc areas of hypofluorescence28 ( representing retinal nonperfusion or capillary dropout ) or areas of microvascular pathology ( multiple microaneurysms and significant perivascular leakage ) on uwfa . 
 five disc areas was also the mean size of peripheral retinal nonperfusion of all our patients with crvo . because of the effect of upper and lower eyelid and eyelashes  the far periphery in the horizontal plane alone ( the nasal and temporal retina ) was analyzed . 
 collected parameters included demographic information  previous ocular history  number and dates of intravitreal injections  central subfield thickness  peripheral retinal ischemia  central intraretinal fluid  visual acuity  and intraocular pressure ( throughout the study period ) as well as the occurrence of any complications . 
 data were collected and analyzed using spss software ( version 20.0  ibm corporation  armonk  ny  usa ) . each graded variable was tested for normal distribution . 
 spearman rho test was used for correlation analysis . a p - value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant . 
 fifty - four eyes of fifty - four consecutive patients with treatment - nave crvo were enrolled in this study . 
 twenty - eight patients ( 52% ) were male  and twenty - three eyes ( 42.6% ) were located on the right side . 
 seven patients ( 12.9% ) had known glaucoma  36 patients ( 66.6% ) had systemic hypertension  and 22 patients ( 40.7% ) were pseudophakic . 
 all patients had center - involving macular edema confirmed by macular leakage seen in fa and retinal thickening in sd - oct images . 
 tables 1 and 2 show the baseline and final bcva and cst . as shown in the tables  there were significant improvements in the visual acuity within and between groups  whereas changes in cst were not significant . 
 twenty - four eyes ( 44% ) showing less than five disc areas of retinal nonperfusion ( group 1 ) that received a mean number of 4.122.73 intravitreal ranibizumab injections . 
 thirty eyes ( 56% ) showed more than five disc areas ( group 2 ) of retinal nonperfusion in uwfa and received a mean number of 9.323.84 intravitreal ranibizumab injections ( p<0.001  mann  whitney u - test ) . 
 there was a significant positive correlation between the size of peripheral retinal nonperfusion measured in terms of disc areas and the number of injections in each group . 
 there was also a significant correlation between the size of retinal nonperfusion and final bcva in each group . 
 there was no significant correlation between the size of retinal nonperfusion and final cst in each group . 
 we did not observe any eye with neovascularization of the disc or neovascularization elsewhere during the observation period ; therefore  panretinal photocoagulation was not performed during this study . 
 furthermore  no cases of injection - related adverse events like retinal detachment or endophthalmitis were encountered . 
 venous occlusive disease of the retina is the second most common retinal vascular disorder after diabetic retinopathy.29 it typically affects patients between 40 and 80 years of age.30 usually  a decrease of visual acuity is the result of macular edema  which can lead to permanent visual loss and even legal blindness in severe cases . applying uwfa 
  we found a significant correlation between the total number of intravitreal ranibizumab injections and the size of nonperfusion in the peripheral retina : crvo patients with peripheral retinal nonperfusion received more intravitreal injections for treatment of their macular edema than patients without peripheral retinal nonperfusion . 
 we hypothesized that nonperfused peripheral retina could be a source of increased intraocular vegf levels with consecutive macular edema . 
 this observation could explain the requirement for more frequent intravitreal anti - vegf injections of in crvo patients with macular edema and peripheral retinal nonperfusion . 
 this finding is important because an evaluation of the peripheral retina using uwfa may be a prognostic factor and allows the ophthalmologists to estimate the requirement for more or fewer intravitreal injections based on the peripheral retinal perfusion status . 
 looking at the perfusion of the peripheral retina in those patients  a more precise evaluation of the estimated treatment costs within a defined health care system may be feasible  including a better evaluation of injection - related complications such as endophthalmitis or other complications . 
 interestingly  the lack of observed neovascularizations in any of the patients even with extended areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion might be attributed to good patient compliance  strict follow - up visits every 4 weeks  and immediate treatment in case of detected macular edema . 
 the results of our study differ from those published by spaide31 and singer et al.32 spaide evaluated 22 patients treated with ranibizumab for crvo and found that the area of peripheral nonperfusion was not correlated with the number of injections . 
 the follow - up time of his study was longer than ours  but the sample size was smaller . 
 singer et al32 evaluated 32 patients with retinal vein occlusion and refractory macular edema using sd - oct and uwfa . 
 those patients were retreated with intravitreal injections with anti - vegf and with dexamethasone intravitreal implant . there was no significant difference in the number of anti - vegf ( 1.8 vs 1.6  p=0.438 ) or dexamethasone implant ( 1.4 vs 1.6  p=0.364 ) treatments given between the > 10% and 10% nonperfusion groups  nor was there any difference regarding the time to recurrence ( 3.4 vs 4.3 months  p=0.440 ) . in singer et al s series  there were 13 crvo patients with previously failed contiguous therapy with intravitreal ranibizumab and dexamethasone implant . 
 in contrast  we enrolled previously untreated ( treatment - nave ) patients ; furthermore  the number of our cases was higher than in the abovementioned studies . 
 we previously reported that peripheral retinal nonperfusion correlates significantly with intravitreal ranibizumab injections in patients with brvo and macular edema.33 rehak et al34 evaluated 22 crvo patients in a randomized clinical trial and suggested the selective laser photocoagulation of peripheral areas of nonperfusion may further improve the visual outcome and decrease the number of needed ranibizumab reinjections in crvo patients . 
 there are only few published articles regarding the size of peripheral retinal nonperfusion using uwfa . 
 we calculated the mean size of peripheral retinal nonperfusion for all enrolled patients  which was five disc areas  and then the patients were divided into two groups according to that cut - off point . 
 however  the authors totally agree that this approach is not an established step due to lack of evidence . moreover  there are several problems in the interpretation of fluorescein angiograms . 
 the grading of the ultrawide - field angiograms is not uniform because there are eyelash artifacts that influence the entire amount of interpretable fundus  and the graders can also change the clarity of the images that may cause intergrader variability . 
 another drawback of our study design was that we performed uwfa for each patient at only one single time point . 
 thus  we were not able to demonstrate potential dynamic angiographic changes in nonperfusion areas over the follow - up time . 
 in conclusion  uwfa is a precise tool for the detection and quantification of retinal nonperfusion which correlated with the number of needed intravitreal ranibizumab injections in our patients with crvo . 
 retinal nonperfusion could be considered as a prognostic factor for a more precise patient management ."," 


Abstract: This study aims to evaluate the correlation between peripheral retinal nonperfusion size and intravitreal ranibizumab injections in treatment-naive central retinal vein occlusion patients. Approaches included monthly imaging and injections, resulting in improved visual acuity and positive correlation between nonperfusion areas and number of injections.

Research and Discussion: Fifty-four treatment-naive CRVO patients underwent macular imaging and injections according to GER society recommendations. Two ophthalmologists noted the severity of peripheral retinal nonperfusion, which revealed a significant positive correlation with injection number. This suggests the usefulness of wide-field fluorescein angiography in diagnosing and treating these patients.

Results and Conclusion: Best-corrected visual acuity improved after multiple injections (p<0.001). Final central subfield thickness did not significantly differ between groups, but injection number did (p<0.001). There was a positive correlation between nonperfusion size and injection number in both groups. This suggests that wide-field fluorescein angiography is useful for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of CRVO patients."
"small bowel obstruction ( sbo ) is one of the most feared complications after a gastric bypass . it can be chronic or acute and can range from a nuisance to the patient to a life - threatening emergency 
 sbos related to adhesions occur after laparoscopic roux - en - y gastric bypass ( lgb )  but ih formation  secondary to the reconstruction of the small intestine  is also of concern to bariatric surgeons . 
 multiple defects in the mesentery of the bowel can occur and may lead to ih and  in an antecolic bypass  a defect is associated with the roux limb passing over the transverse colon . 
 the reported incidence of sbo after lgb varies widely  perhaps because the technique used in the operation also varies widely  not only in placement of the roux limb  but regarding closure or nonclosure of the mesenteric defects . 
 the disparity in reports leads to confusion regarding the true incidence and even the causes of sbo after lgb . 
 in addition  the closure of mesenteric defects is questioned in a substantial body of literature . 
 the objective of this study was to examine the incidence and characteristics of sbo after antecolic antegastric bypass with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect of the jejunojejunal ( jj ) anastomosis . 
 following health insurance portability and accountability act guidelines  the author performed a retrospective chart review of a series of consecutive lgbs performed over a 3-year period and recorded in a prospectively maintained database . 
 the follow up of the patients included office visits at 1 week  1 month  3 months  6 months  and then  yearly . 
 all procedures were performed by the same surgeon using the antecolic antegastric technique . in no case was the mesenteric defect closed . 
 any patients presenting with signs and symptoms of an sbo were emergently taken to the operating room . 
 the policy of our bariatric program has always been to explore aggressively any patient with suspicion of an sbo  whether based on physical examination  radiographic studies  or history . 
 patients with an sbo were usually taken to the operating room from the emergency department . 
 those who underwent revisional bariatric surgery or conversion to open operation during the primary surgery were excluded . 
 revisional procedures were not included because adhesions may have formed from the previous bariatric surgery that could have confounded the results . 
 all patients had given informed consent prior to surgery for their deidentified data to be used for study purposes . 
 the gastric pouch was sized to 20 ml with an orogastric balloon with 4 to 5 staple loads with seamguard ( w. l. gore  flagstaff  arizona ) staple - line reinforcement ( slr ) and the echelon 60-mm stapler ( ethicon endo - surgery  cincinnati  ohio ) . 
 the small bowel was divided 40 cm from the ligament of treitz  and the mesentery had minimal division . 
 the only division of the mesentery was from the same staple load that divided the small bowel . 
 the roux limb was measured to 100 to 120 cm  depending on the body mass index ( bmi ) of the patient . 
 the gastrojejunal anastomosis was hand sewn in 2 layers with absorbable sutures over a 34 french bougie . 
 the jejunojejunostomy was formed with a single firing of the same stapler  and the enteroenterostomy was closed with the stapler . in all cases  
 an intraoperative endoscopy was used to check the gastrojejunal anastomosis  and drains were used in all male patients because of higher technical difficulty and higher rates of mortality and morbidity ; in patients with a bmi over 50  for the same reasons ; and in selected cases . 
 there was one conversion to an open operation for an incomplete malrotation ; there was no mortality .

 there was one conversion to an open operation for an incomplete malrotation ; there was no mortality . 
 there were 249 primary lgbs performed in the study period ( january 1  2011  through december 31  2013 ) . 
 sbo in 4 cases was caused by ih ( incidence of 1.6% ) and by adhesions in 11 ( 73% ) ( figure 1 ) . in the cases with ih  
 the most common locations were from the jj to the roux limb ( n = 5 )  followed by those forming from the jj to the abdominal wall ( n = 3 )  and 1 each from the jj to the colon and from the jj to the common channel ( figure 2 ) . in all cases  the adhesions were treated with laparoscopic lysis . 
 the average time to sbo was 8.1 months ( range  121 ) from the initial surgery . 
 sbo is common after lgb and can be easily managed or can just as easily lead to disaster if not recognized and treated promptly . 
 the surgical literature has many articles that discuss ih formation  and an area of contention has been closure versus nonclosure of the mesenteric defects . 
 most authors seem to agree that if a retrocolic gastric bypass is performed  the mesocolic defect must be closed  which can lead to a 0% rate of ih formation  although that number can climb as high as 15% . 
 elms et al showed that  in almost 2 400 patients who underwent antecolic antegastric bypass  ih formed in only 1.1%  primarily at the mesenteric defect . in those cases the defects had all been closed . 
 cho et al had a 0.2% ih formation rate in 1 400 patients who underwent antecolic antegastric bypasses with no mesenteric closure and no division of the mesentery . 
 rodriguez et al also reported that minimal division of the mesentery could lead to a decrease in ih formation . 
 they showed that  with closure of the defect but with wide opening of the mesentery  there was a 14.4% ih rate ; if the defect was closed and the mesentery was not widely opened  the ih rate dropped to 1.1% . 
 abasbassi et al showed a lower ih formation rate with no division of the mesentery  but also no closure of the mesentery . 
 this cumulative experience could indicate that a way to decrease ih formation is to perform a minimal division of the mesentery . 
 obeid et al used mixed techniques in both retro- and antecolic bypasses  some with closure of defects  some without . in 679 patients with an antecolic roux limb  the majority of all the defects closed . in the retrocolic group  
 almost 4% of these had closure of the mesenteric defect  8.4% had nonclosure ; 3.8% were in antecolic and 8.5% in retrocolic bypasses . 
 this wide range of techniques makes an overall analysis of the literature difficult . in 2010 in jsls  hope and colleagues examined the incidence of ih formation after documented closure of mesenteric defects . 
 permanent sutures were used to close these defects  but 15 of 18 patients in the series presented with open defects  causing ih . 
 these outcomes indicate that closure of the defects may not be as permanent as surgeons would like to believe  and indeed this very situation was the catalyst for this paper . in our lgbs  we were closing all defects  but our ih formation rate seemed to be climbing . 
 we noticed most of the mesenteric defects were open at reoperation  and so we switched to nonclosure . 
 as demonstrated here  the published papers on the subject have reported a wide range of ih incidence  from 0% to 15.5% . 
 another complicating factor may be that many of the papers published in this area are from surgical programs training fellows  and the association of postsurgical complications with performance of operations by fellows is not known . in this study  the author specifically examined the incidence and cause of sbo in antecolic antegastric bypasses . in no case was either the mesenteric or antecolic defect closed . 
 the interesting finding was that  of an overall incidence of sbo of 6%  only 1.6% of the total was caused by ih formation  all at the jj mesenteric defect . 
 this outcome compares favorably with the ih formation rate reported by other authors who did or did not close the defects . also  the incidence of sbo caused by adhesions is higher in the current study than in some others . 
 elms et al reported that 47.6% of the sbos in their series were secondary to adhesions  mostly at the jj  compared with our rate of 73% . 
 the opposing end of the adhesion had multiple locations  but the staple line of the jj was always at one end  perhaps because of the intense inflammatory reaction that it generates . 
 a hand - sewn technique could be used to close the common enterotomy and might reduce the incidence of sbo slightly  but the cut end of the biliopancreatic limb still has an exposed staple line . 
 the strength of this study is in the homogeneity of the technique used  as this was a single - surgeon series . however  its strength is also its chief weakness  as the results may not be reproducible by others . 
 the number of sbos is also small enough to raise the possibility of a type ii error . 
 the author lives in a geographically isolated part of the country  with no other surgeons who are willing to care for bariatric patients  and so it was more likely that all the sbos would be treated by the same bariatric surgeon . 
 another limitation of the study is that it was a small series with a short follow - up . 
 although only the years of 2011 through 2013 were examined  and the average time to sbo was 8.1 months  it is possible that the sbo rate will climb in these same patients as time passes  and some of the patients are likely to be lost to follow - up . 
 another confounding factor is that an slr was used early in the series at the jj  but not in later operations . 
 there may be an association of slr with adhesion formation  but the connection is not clear . 
 the most common location of adhesions was at the jj  were slr was used  but about half of the sbos caused solely by adhesions to the jj occurred after the use of slr was abandoned  so there are probably not enough cases to tell if the use of slr increases sbo . 
 the usual weaknesses of a retrospective study apply to this paper as they do to all other studies about ih formation . 
 surgeons should remember that the mainstay of treatment of sbo after lgb is an operation . 
 an isolated roux limb obstruction can be decompressed by vomiting  and the placement of an ngt involves risk of a perforation . 
 the surgeon should move the patient quickly to the operating room once an sbo is diagnosed or even suspected  as bowel ischemia can lead to extensive bowel resection and nutritional debility or even death . 
 these operations can often be performed laparoscopically  but laparotomy is also safe and effective . 
 the incidence of sbo caused by ih with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect is similar to that in other series where the defect was closed . 
 regardless of the cause of the sbo  operation remains the definitive treatment and should not be delayed in the gastric bypass patient .","

1) Abstract: This study aims to examine the incidence of small bowel obstruction (SBO) after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LGB) with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect of the jejunojejunal anastomosis. Results showed a 6.0% incidence of SBO, with 1.6% caused by internal hernias and 73% caused by adhesions. Operative treatment should not be delayed in these cases.
2) Research and Discussion: A retrospective review of 249 consecutive LGBs with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect was conducted over a 3-year period. The incidence of SBO was found to be relatively common at 6.0%, with majority caused by adhesions rather than an internal hernia. Whether the mesenteric defect is closed or not does not significantly affect the incidence of SBO.
3) Results and Conclusion: 15 out of 249 patients (6.0%) developed SBO after LGB. 1.6% of cases were due to internal hernias and 73% were caused by adhesions. Operative treatment should not be delayed and remains the definitive standard for patients with gastric bypass. The incidence of SBO is similar to other series where the mesenteric defect is closed, indicating that closure of the defect may not impact the development of SBO."
"the following section describes the treatment procedure for patients with deep infection following tka using modified static spacers . 
 the original prosthesis was removed  followed by intensive irrigation and wide debridement of the infected soft tissue . a 36 fr - diameter straight thoracic catheter ( mallinckrodt medical  athlone  ireland ) and a steinmann pin measuring 3.0 mm in diameter and 22 cm in length 
 vancomycin ( 2 g ) was then added to the gentamicin bone cement ( depuy  warsaw  in  usa ) . at the late liquid stage of the cement  
 the steinmann pin was inserted into the tube  and the prepared cement was delivered through the tube . during this procedure  
 the tube was removed from the cement rod using a surgical knife . finally  a cement rod measuring 9 mm in diameter and 22 cm in length was formed ( fig . 
 an entry hole was created at the center of the distal femur and proximal tibia for the insertion of the cement rod . 
 the rod was then inserted into the femur and tibia through this hole . during insertion 
  it was important to place the center of the cement rod on an imaginary joint line . 
 the proximal medullary canal of the tibia was filled with antibiotic - impregnated cement up to the surface of the proximal tibia  while the surgical assistant maintained proper anatomic alignment and joint space . 
 the space between the cement of the distal femur and the proximal tibia was filled with more antibiotic - impregnated cement . 
 finally  the suprapatellar pouch and medial and lateral gutter space were filled with antibiotic - impregnated cement to reduce soft tissue adhesion ( fig . 
 cylinder splint immobilization was required for three days after the operation  after which a fixed - angle knee brace was used and toe - touching ambulation was allowed until the reimplantation surgery . 
 from april to november 2007  the authors performed the static technique in four patients using the novel antibiotic - impregnated cement rod for the treatment of infected tka ( culture : staphylococcus in three cases and no bacteria in one case ) . 
 follow - up laboratory studies  including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c - reactive protein  culture study via knee aspiration and a frozen biopsy from the second - stage operation ( < 5 polymorpho - leukocytes / high power field ) were performed to confirm successful eradication of the infection . 
 the second - stage reimplantation was performed when all the criteria for the validation of infection control were met ( fig . 
 the second - stage reimplantation was performed using the rectus snipping approach  and more than 90 of flexion was obtained intra - operatively . in all four patients  
 no re - infection was evident after two and a half years of follow - up . 
 the range of motion of the knee joints were respectively improved from 50 to 80  95  and 100  and the knee society scores were 70  86  65  and 84  respectively  in the last follow - up evaluation . fehring et al.8 ) emphasized the importance of resting the joint in septic joint conditions . 
 others also reported that the static spacer technique provides more stability than the mobile spacer technique in patients with severe bone loss.58 ) the main advantage of this technique is the maintenance of a normally aligned lower limb during the interval period . 
 this maintains knee stability in combination with early muscle strengthening exercises  including quadriceps setting exercise  and enables the patient to comfortably dress and manage him / herself during the intervening period . 
 the cement rod and static spacer provide a stable gap between the femur and tibia  thereby minimizing soft tissue contracture and shortening of the lower limb . 
 in addition  symmetric maintenance of the soft tissue of both medial and lateral gutters requires no additional soft tissue balancing at the second - stage reimplantation . 
 the additional cost of a metal nail  however  and the difficulty in infection control due to biofilm formation around the metal nail can be troublesome . in addition  a metal nail can not be removed easily at the second stage reimplantation due to its hardness  and soft tissue adhesion of the femoral or tibial medullary canals . on the other hand  
 an antibiotic - impregnated cement rod enjoys advantages  such as inexpensive antibiotic delivery to the marrow spaces and easy removal by using a hercules cutter . 
 in addition  a static spacer is anchored to the cement rod  which can prevent spacer migration and bone erosion . 
 this feature is believed to generate less cement wear debris than with the conventional static spacer or mobile articulating spacer technique . during the conduct of the antibiotic - impregnated cement rod technique  
 antibiotic - impregnated cement was applied to the proximal tibia  distal femur  joint gap space  suprapatellar pouch  and both gutters in a stepwise manner . 
 this technique enables easy removal of the cement and reduced soft tissue adhesion at second - stage reimplantation .","

Abstract:
A new two-stage exchange arthroplasty technique using an antibiotic-impregnated cement intramedullary nail is described. This technique provides stability to the knee and reduces pain, soft tissue contracture, and scar adhesion. It also effectively controls infections following total knee arthroplasty.

Research and Discussion:
The use of an antibiotic-impregnated cement intramedullary nail during surgery using a straight thoracic tube and a steinmann pin provides additional stability. This study reports less pain during the prosthesis removal and reimplantation period, reduced soft tissue contracture and scar adhesion, and successful infection control.

Results and Conclusion:
The novel two-stage exchange arthroplasty technique using an antibiotic-impregnated cement intramedullary nail demonstrates promising results in terms of stability and infection control. This technique may improve patient outcomes and reduce complications such as pain, soft tissue contracture, and scar adhesion. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to optimize the technique."
"mental fatigue is common and can be a disabling long - time condition following a stroke . 
 it has been estimated that about 3070% of stroke survivors complain of fatigue [ 17 ] . even for those with an almost recovered stroke and without neurological and neuropsychological impairments  
 the person who suffers from mental fatigue is able to perform mental effort just for short periods  and  notably  it will take longer than normal to regain energy after being exhausted . accompanying symptoms  such as irritability  sensitivity to stress  concentration difficulties  and emotional instability may further impair social interactions [ 811 ] . 
 however  attention has been paid to poststroke fatigue during the last 10 years  and fatigue is now generally held as a separate phenomenon [ 46  1214 ] . 
 few investigations have been carried out to evaluate fatigue and cognitive functions following a stroke . 
 leegard reported that fatigue is frequent following a stroke but did not find any related impaired cognitive functions . 
 van zandvoort and coauthors investigated lacunar infarct and reported frequent difficulties relating to fatigue and a decreased cognitive performance under more demanding conditions . with the intention to increase knowledge about mental fatigue and cognitive difficulties related to stroke 
  we examined well - rehabilitated stroke participants  who had suffered from long - term mental fatigue for at least one year prior to examination . 
 the subjects were examined for subjective self - reporting of mental fatigue  depression  and anxiety symptoms . 
 neuropsychological tests were aimed at evaluating information processing speed  attention  and working memory . 
 twenty - four participants  having recovered from neurological symptoms  but suffering from pathological mental fatigue for at least one year following a stroke and 24 healthy controls were included in the study . 
 the study persons were recruited from an advertisement in a local  daily newspaper or from the neurological clinic at the local university hospital and were later included in intervention studies . 
 the stroke subjects should have been healthy and at work before the stroke meaning that they had no known diseases but hypertonia was present among some participants . 
 the type of stroke was obtained from medical records and self - reports ( see table 1 ) . 
 the control participants were recruited from the local community  with no history of brain injury  stroke  psychiatric or neurological disorder  and no drug abuse  and they were fully able to work . 
 they performed cognitive tests focused on information processing speed  attention  and working memory . 
 the self - assessment for mental fatigue is a multidimensional questionnaire containing 15 questions and is adapted from rdholm et al . . 
 the self - reported questionnaire covers the most common symptoms occurring after brain injury  stroke  or other neurological disorders affecting the brain [ 11  17 ] . 
 the self - assessment scale for mental fatigue and related items has been evaluated  and the 14 questions had adequate internal consistency with a cronbach 's alpha of 0.94 . 
 the questions concern fatigue in general  lack of initiative  mental fatigue  mental recovery  concentration difficulties  memory problems  slowness of thinking  sensitivity to stress  increased tendency to become emotional  irritability  sensitivity to light and noise  and decreased or increased duration of sleep as well as 24-hour variations . 
 this cprs scale is used here for self - assessment of depression and anxiety . 
 the neuropsychological tests included digit symbol - coding from the wais - iii  measuring information processing speed  digit span from the wais - iii  measuring attention and working memory ; verbal fluency test  fas ; trail making test ( tmt ) a and b  measuring visual scanning  divided attention and motor speed . in order to evaluate higher demands such as dual tasks  
 a series of two new trail making tests was constructed with three and four factors  respectively . 
 months were added in part c and both months and days of the week in chronological order in part d. in the latter  the order of letters and digits was switched . 
 a new computer test was constructed in our department including a single and a complex subtest . 
 the single test included speed of mouse click in four squares  located in each corner of a bigger square ( 6  6  cm ) on the computer screen and was performed in a clockwise order . 
 a mouse click outside the square was recorded as a miss  and a new click was necessary to do in order to be able to go on with the test . 
 the complex sub - test also included the same mouse clicking procedure  but at the same time  the subject was asked to count how many instances of a specific digit between zero and nine  randomly chosen  he / she could see . 
 after the 30 seconds  the subject was asked to report how many of the specific digit he / she had seen . 
 it was possible to measure the difference in speed between a single and a complex task  variability over time  and errors made in counting digits . in the complex test  it was necessary to attend to both the square and the digits . 
 a comparison between groups was done by t - test and analysis of covariance ( ancova ) . 
 the mann - whitney u test was used when analyzing separate items included in the self - assessment scales . 
 pearson 's correlation and linear regression were used for analysis of connections between variables . spss 16.0 for windows 
 the control group had significantly more years of education than the stroke group ( t - test  p = 0.001 )  and age was almost significantly different when comparing the two groups ( p = 0.055  table 1 ) . 
 accordingly  ancova  controlling for the variance for education and age  was conducted for all the variables analysed . 
 the only significant gender difference found was that the control females were faster in the digit symbol - coding test  and an ancova  also controlling for sex  was conducted for this variable . 
 a significant difference was found between the groups for the total sum of scores for mental fatigue . 
 the mean value for the stroke group was 18.4 with a 95% confidence interval of between 16.420.5 . 
 the mean value for the control group was 4.0  with a 95% confidence interval of between 2.95.0 ( see figure 1 ) . 
 the total score for the cprs scale  taken from the depression and anxiety subscale  was also rated significantly higher in the stroke group compared to controls ( see table 2  figure 1 ) . the significant effect for mental fatigue remained after adjustment for depression ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 all the separate items in the self - assessment scale for mental fatigue were rated significantly higher for the stroke group compared to controls . 
 the cprs gave the following findings : without taking into account overlapping items  the items relating to sadness  emotional involvement  pessimistic thoughts  and zest for life rated significantly higher for the stroke group ( adjusted for multiple comparisons  as shown in figure 2 ) . among the stroke subjects  
 74% reported a clear 24-hour variation with morning most frequently reported to be the best time of the day and afternoon and evening the worst . 
 the participants from the stroke group were significantly slower on the test measuring information processing speed  primarily digit symbol - coding  and also reading speed and number of mouse clicks in the computer test . 
 the stroke group was also significantly slower and made more errors in tmt d  the most demanding of the tmt tests . 
 they were also significantly slower on tmt b  and produced fewer words on the verbal fluency test . 
 the result for the simple mouse click sub - test was found to be significantly faster for the controls compared with the stroke subjects . the computer test which placed a simultaneous demand on speed  attention  and working memory  resulted in a fairly good speed for the stroke subjects  with no detected difference in speed compared to the controls . on the contrary  the stroke subjects made significantly more errors compared to the controls ( table 2  figure 3 ) . 
 the cognitive tests with significant results ( p < 0.05  see table 2 ) were included in a linear regression model  using the enter method . 
 digit symbol - coding ( p = 0.004 ) and the scores for number of errors in the computer test ( p = 0.018 ) were significant predictors for mental fatigue  while the other scores were not significant predictors for mental fatigue . 
 digit symbol - coding and number of errors in the computer test also correlated significantly to the mental fatigue sum of scores ( r = 0.59 and r = 0.46 ) . 
 the total scores for cprs  depression  and anxiety were on a significantly higher level compared to controls . 
 the madrs  which provides a separate scale  has the same format as the cprs self - assessment scale depression  except that the items are graded in a different way . in the cprs scale  
 depression  the highest level is three for each separate cprs item  while the levels for the alternatives in the madrs scale are double for each separate item  with the highest level being 6 . according to madrs 
  a score between 12 and 20 is regarded as mild depression and 21 and above indicates a probable true depression . 
 the mean level of eight for the stroke subjects corresponds to 16 on madrs  indicating an overall mild level of depression . 
 there was a highly significant difference between the groups on their self - assessment of mental fatigue  with a mean value of 18 reported for the almost recovered stroke group and a mean value of four for the control group . 
 the self - assessment scale has no cut - off value for fatigue  but our experience shows that a value of 15 and above indicates a clear problem with mental fatigue [ 9  23 ] . the clear difference in 24-hour variation also showed the specific exhaustion mental fatigue subjects experience during the active time of the day . 
 it should be noticed that stroke victims were included due to the presence of mental fatigue during one year or more following the stroke . 
 the data we have presented in our study do not include an indication of the frequency of mental fatigue after different types of stroke . 
 however  on an individual basis  according to madrs  eight participants were not depressed  seven had an indicated mild depression  and nine had a probable  true depression . among the controls  two participants scored on a mild depression level  while the remainder scored below this level . 
 the total sum of scores on the depression scales may be deceptive if a person is complaining of concentration difficulties and fatigue  but does not have a depressed mood  nor a lack of interest in and enjoyment of daily activities . in this study 
  three items were overlapping between mental fatigue and depression  and these items were rated on a higher level than the corresponding specific items on the depression sub - scale ( see figure 2 ) . 
 depression and mental fatigue can occur on their own  but they sometimes occur simultaneously  as shown in this study . accordingly  we suggest mental fatigue and depression to be independent phenomena following a stroke . 
 this also conforms with the findings from other studies [ 46  12  13 ] .   the distressing exhaustion along with the bad memory  concentration difficulties  and not being able to perform simultaneous tasks are the phenomena many subjectively complain of following a stroke . 
 it is important to include cognitive tests in the examinations in order to better understand the difficulties connected to mental fatigue and for the purpose of recommending treatment strategies . in this study  
 physically well - recovered stroke subjects  who had no medical problems except long - term mental fatigue  also showed decreased information processing speed and made more errors in demanding cognitive tasks compared to the control subjects . 
 processing speed is also fundamental and important when considering cognitive functions of a higher order . 
 few studies have been carried out which cover fatigue and cognitive performance following a stroke . 
 however  studies have shown the connection between fatigue and decreased cognitive performance under more demanding conditions  while no cognitive impairments were detected  despite frequent fatigue . with more demanding and sensitive tests  including processing speed and complex attention  it may be possible to detect cognitive impairments accompanying mental fatigue . 
 this is important  as mental fatigue and cognitive deficits will be an obstacle to almost recovered stroke subjects who are on their way to a return to work and previous activities  as every - day life today is complex  with high demands being placed on simultaneous and rapid decisions . in conclusion  mental fatigue is disabling for many people following an almost recovered stroke  and this is suggested to be related to cognitive impairments  primarily information processing speed  and attention . 
 mental fatigue should also be treated as a separate phenomenon and should be differentiated from  and not confused with  depression . 
 today  no specific guidelines exist for the treatment of mental fatigue  and research is urgently needed for this common yet distressing symptom .","

Abstract: This study examines mental fatigue in stroke survivors one year or more after their stroke, in relation to depression and cognitive functions. Findings suggest a strong correlation between mental fatigue and depression, as well as cognitive impairments such as slower processing speed and errors in attention and speed tests. Mental fatigue should be treated as a separate phenomenon and differentiated from depression. 

Research and Discussion: The study included 24 stroke survivors and 24 healthy controls, who were examined using self-assessment scales and cognitive tests. The results showed a significantly higher rating of mental fatigue, depression, and anxiety among the stroke survivors. The study suggests that mental fatigue after a stroke is primarily related to cognitive impairments, specifically slower processing speed. 

Results and Conclusion: The results of the study support a link between mental fatigue and depression in stroke survivors, as well as cognitive impairments in information processing speed and attention and speed tests. These findings highlight the need for mental fatigue to be recognized and treated as a separate issue from depression and other emotional symptoms after a stroke. Further research is necessary to fully understand the implications of mental fatigue on stroke recovery and quality of life."
"cigarette smoke ( cs ) is associated with the development of inflammation - related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and vascular diseases  including atherosclerosis and stroke . 
 several studies have revealed that cs is a major contributor to vascular diseases because it accelerates the development of atherosclerotic plaques . 
 the relationship between cs and the increased incidence of atherosclerosis has been reported [ 57 ]  which may be a consequence of direct endothelial damage  increased proliferation of smooth muscle in atherosclerotic lesions  and/or decreased vasodilation . 
 endothelial damage has also been suggested as the initial cause of development of vascular diseases . in a previous study  it was shown that inhibition of oxidative stress exerts protection in human endothelial cells  which could be an effective strategy in the treatment of vascular diseases . 
 a number of studies support that reactive oxygen species ( ros ) causing oxidative stress may play an essential role in mediating endothelial cell death . 
 oxidative stress is a major factor in vascular diseases such as hypertension  stroke  and atherosclerosis . 
 korean red ginseng ( krg ) is a popular traditional herbal medicine that has been widely used to treat several diseases such as cancer and vascular diseases . 
 recent research shows that ginseng may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of alzheimer 's disease  diabetes  cancer  and cardiovascular diseases  through its antioxidant  antithrombotic  antihyperlipidemic  and anticancer effects [ 1215 ] . in endothelial cells 
  krg simulates no production in vivo and in vitro  suggesting that krg has antihypertensive effects . 
 krg also promotes angiogenesis through the activation of the signaling pathway  indicating that krg can be implicated in potential angiogenic therapies for improving tissue repair  wound healing  and cardiovascular diseases . 
 in addition  our previous study suggested that krg exerts a cytoprotective effect through the induction of heme oxygenase ( ho)-1 expression  suggesting a possible therapeutic mechanism of krg in cardiovascular diseases . 
 it is well known that chronic inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of many human diseases such as atherosclerosis . 
 accumulating evidence suggests that krg is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses  suggesting an anti - inflammatory effect of krg . 
 cyclooxygenase ( cox ) catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins that play vital roles in multiple physiological and pathophysiological processes  including inflammation . 
 in particular  cox-2 is normally undetectable in most tissues and is induced in response to numerous stimuli . 
 vascular diseases may  in part  be caused by cox-2 upregulation at sites of inflammation and vascular injury . 
 cox-2 plays an important role in inflammation  therefore  inhibition of cox-2 expression may participate in the treatment of inflammation - related diseases such as vascular diseases . 
 the objective of our study was to investigate the vascular protective effect of krg in acrolein - stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) . 
 therefore  we examined the involvement of cox-2 expression via p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk )  intracellular ros  and apoptosis in acrolein - stimulated huvecs . 
 krg powder was obtained from the korea ginseng corporation ( daejeon  korea ) . m199 medium and fetal bovine serum 
 krg powder was soaked in water ( 1:25  w / w ) for 3  h  and boiled for 40  min . 
 following centrifugation at 1900 g for 60  min  supernatants of ginseng extract were further centrifuged at 10000  g for 30  min and lyophilized . 
 the general composition of the product offered by the korea ginseng corporation is as follows : moisture 36%  solid volume 64%  ash 2.5%  total fat 0.05%  total crude saponin 70  mg / g  and total ginsenosides 20  mg / g . 
 huvecs were maintained in m199 medium and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  1% penicillin and streptomycin  10  ng / ml human fibroblast growth factor  and 18  mu / ml heparin . 
 huvecs were grown to 80% confluence  maintained with fresh medium described above  and subcultured every 2 or 3  d. the cells were used within nine passages during these experiments . 
 we applied 20 or 40  g of the whole cell lysate proteins to each lane and analyzed them with western blotting . 
 western blotting was performed using primary antibodies as follows : anti - cox-2  p38 mapk  phopho - p38  cyclic amp - responsive element - binding protein ( creb )  phospho - creb ( cell signaling  danvers  ma  usa ) and anti - glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( abfrontier  seoul  korea ) . 
 horseradish - peroxidase - conjugated anti - igg antibodies were used as the secondary antibody to detect the above - mentioned protein bands by enhanced chemiluminescence westsave - up ( abfrontier ) . 
 the rna pellets were washed in 70% ethanol  dried completely  and dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate to inhibit rnase . 
 total rna was quantified using a nd-100 spectrometer ( nanodrop technologies  wilmington  de  usa ) . 
 polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) was performed using the synthesized cdna as a template and using specific primers for cox-2 or -actin as a loading control . 
 the primer sequence for human cox-2 was 5-gacagtccaccaacttacaat-3 ( forward ) and 5-catctctccatcaattatctgat-3 ( reverse ) . 
 the amplified products were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis  stained with ethidium bromide  and photographed under ultraviolet light . 
 huvecs were cultured in a glass culture chamber slide ( falcon plastics  london ontario  canada ) and processed for immunofluorescence analysis . 
 the amount of prostaglandin ( pg)e2 in the culture medium was measured using the pge2 eia kit according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( cayman chemical company  ann arbor  mi  usa ) . 
 samples as well as standards were applied to a 96-well plate  precoated with goat anti - mouse igg  and incubated with pge2 acetylcholinesterase tracer and pge2 antiserum . 
 all the wells were emptied  rinsed five times  and incubated with ellman 's reagent for 60  min in the dark with gentle rocking to produce 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid  which has a strong absorbance at 405  nm ; the plate was read at 405  nm in an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay reader ( el 800 ; bio - tek  winooski  vt  usa ) . 
 we calculated the results using the standard curve  which were expressed as picograms per milliliter . 
 intracellular ros in acrolein - stimulated huvecs is analyzed using a fluorescent dye  27-dichlorofluorescein diacetate ( dcf / da ) . in the presence of oxidants  
 after 18  h incubation with 25  m acrolein in the presence or absence of krg  cells were stained with 10  m dcf / da  and fluorescence was analyzed by a facs vantage flow cytometer ( becton dickinson  san jose  ca  usa ) and fluorescence microscopy ( eclipse 50i ; nikon  japan ) . to clarify whether krg - mediated inhibition of acrolein - induced cox-2 expression plays a significant role in cytoprotection against oxidative stress  acrolein - stimulated cells were pretreated with krg ( 1  mg / ml ) or untreated  and cell death was measured by in situ terminal transferase dutp nick end labeling ( tunel ) assay . to measure dna fragmentation  the commercially available in situ death detection kit ( roche diagnostics  mannheim  germany ) 
 huvecs were cultured in a glass culture chamber slide and fixed for 30  min in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution at room temperature . 
 a tunel assay system was used  according to the manufacturer 's instructions  for examination under a fluorescence microscope  with excitation at 488  nm and emission at 525  nm . 
 fluorescein isothiocyanate ( fitc ) ( bd pharmingen  san diego  ca  usa ) and propidium iodide ( pi ) staining of necrotic and apoptotic cells . 
 cells were washed in pbs  resuspended in 100  l binding buffer containing 5  l annexin v  fitc and 1  g / ml pi  and incubated for 10  min at room temperature in the dark . 
 positioning of quadrants on the annexin v / pi dot plots was performed as previously described . 
 data were expressed as mean    standard deviation . statistical analysis was performed using one - way analysis of variance ( graphpad prism version 4 ; graphpad software  san diego  ca  usa ) followed by bonferroni 's multiple comparison test . 
 a previous study found that acrolein in cs induces cox-2 expression in human endothelial cells . 
 krg inhibited acrolein - induced cox-2 protein expression in a concentration - dependent manner ( fig . 
 after pretreatment of acrolein - stimulated cells with krg  the cells were fixed  and cox-2 localization in huvecs was observed by immunofluorescence staining with an anti - cox-2 antibody followed by a fluorescence - tagged secondary antibody . 
 immunofluorescence analysis showed that acrolein - induced cox-2 protein levels were inhibited in huvecs after treatment with krg ( fig . 
 the induction of cox-2 expression is known to be responsible for pge2 release in the culture medium of cells stimulated with  acrolein . 
 acrolein increased pge2 secretion  which was dramatically reduced by krg ( fig .  2 ) . 
 this result indicates that krg leads to the reduction of cox-2 protein expression and  subsequently pge2 biosynthesis in acrolein - stimulated huvecs . 
 thus  we examined the effect of krg on ros production in acrolein - stimulated cells . 
 the shift to the right of the curve due to increased fluorescence indicates an increase in the intracellular levels of ros . 
 the results indicate that ros generation in cells treated with acrolein increased compared to untreated cells  whereas krg inhibited acrolein - induced ros generation ( fig . 
 these results indicate that krg may play a role in the inhibition of cox-2 expression via reduction of acrolein - generated ros in acrolein - stimulated huvecs . 
 thus  to determine the upstream signaling pathway involved in krg - mediated cox-2 inhibition  we measured the activation of p38 and creb by detecting increased phospho - p38 and phospho - creb levels in acrolein - stimulated cells and found that phosphorylation of p38 and creb was strongly reduced by krg in acrolein - stimulated cells ( fig .  4 ) . 
 these results demonstrate the role of p38 and creb signaling in the inhibition of acrolein - mediated cox-2 induction . 
 fluorescence - activated cell sorting showed that while the number of apoptotic cells increased following treatment with acrolein  pretreatment with krg reduced the number of apoptotic cells ( fig . 
 to confirm this result  we evaluated the presence of dead cells by tunel staining  which is widely used in detecting dna fragmentations in situ . 
 the tunel assay indicates cell death  including apoptosis  by detection of the appearance of intensely stained nuclei  which indicates incorporation of labeled dutp into the 3-end of fragmented dna derived from apoptotic nuclei . as illustrated in fig . 
 5b  acrolein treatment significantly increased the proportion of tunel - positive cells  which was restored by krg pretreatment . 
 these results revealed that the vascular protective effect of krg is mediated by the inhibition of cox-2 expression in acrolein - stimulated huvecs . 
 in this study  we explored the inhibition of an inflammatory mediator  cox-2  by krg water extract in huvecs . 
 we found that krg inhibited both mrna and the protein level of cox-2 and its cytoprotective effect in acrolein - stimulated huvecs . 
 there is increasing evidence that -unsaturated aldehydes in cs  including acrolein and crotonaldehyde play an important pathophysiological role in vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and alzheimer 's disease . 
 exposure to -unsaturated aldehydes is critical to the inflammatory response via activation of the proinflammatory signaling pathway and redox - sensitive transcription factors . 
 furthermore  -unsaturated aldehydes increase oxidative stress  which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases via direct injury to the endothelium . 
 cox-2  a key enzyme for prostaglandin biosynthesis  is an inducible enzyme that is rapidly induced during inflammatory reactions . 
 numerous studies have reported the involvement of cs in vascular diseases through cox-2 and endothelial no synthase activity . 
 chronic inflammation plays an important role in vascular diseases  therefore  cox-2 may participate in the development of inflammation - related diseases  including vascular diseases . 
 ginseng has been used as a general tonic for > 2000 years in east asia  and it has become a famous herbal medicine for treatment of various diseases  including vascular disorders . 
 krg has been reported to have effective pharmacological activities  including antioxidant  anticarcinogenic  and ameliorative effects on blood circulation . 
 recently  the diverse effects of several constituents of krg  including ginsenoside  on endothelial cells have been extensively studied . 
 hien et  al demonstrated the anti - inflammatory and antiatherosclerotic activities of ginsenoside rg3 in human endothelial cells  with a decrease of cell adhesion molecules and proinflammatory cytokines . 
 moreover  the cytoprotective effect of ginsenoside rb1 in endothelial cell damage mediated by oxidized low - density lipoprotein has been reported . 
 several constituents of red ginseng have been reported to regulate proliferation and migration and to protect oxidative stress - mediated damage in human endothelial cells . 
 there is evidence demonstrating the presence of major ginsenosides including rb1 and rg1 in krg water extract . 
 thus  these components could also contribute to the diverse retinue of protective actions of krg . 
 a previous study showed that the induction of ho-1 expression may exert protective effects in krg - treated human endothelial cells . 
 however  there have been no reports revealing the mechanism underlying krg - inhibited cox-2 expression in acrolein  -unsaturated aldehydes in cs  stimulated huvecs . 
 we have established that the major signaling pathway of cox-2 ( i.e.  p38 mapk  creb ) and intracellular ros generation are involved in this inhibition of cox-2 expression in acrolein - stimulated huvecs by krg . as mentioned above 
 therefore  the inhibition of cox-2 expression following krg water extract treatment may be associated with its strong protective effect in acrolein - stimulated huvecs . in conclusion  
 we propose that the krg water extract may exert a cytoprotective effect through the inhibition of cox-2 induction and that this reduction of cox-2 in acrolein - stimulated huvecs is mediated by the p38 mapk

 since the first report of its programmable gene editing potential  the crispr / cas9 technology is revolutionizing all facets of biology from medicine to agriculture ( jinek et  al .  2012 ) . 
 with its efficiency and simplicity  crispr / cas9 has quickly displaced its predecessors ( e.g.  zinc finger and transcription activator - like effector nucleases ) as the method of choice for genome editing ( carroll  2014 ) . for agricultural applications that have traditionally depended on gene - silencing for rna modification  crispr / cas9 is a game changer . 
 the previous methods  such as antisense or rna interference ( rnai )  leave much to be desired as the degree  specificity and stability of gene silencing are not always predictable . 
 this necessitates screening and characterization of a large number of transgenic lines for the desired trait . 
 by contrast  crispr / cas9 is guided to disrupt the reading frame  thereby protein function  of the target gene by dna editing . 
 2012 )  and both monoallelic and biallelic mutations are reported ( bortesi and fischer  2015 ) . with biallelic editing  null mutations are readily obtained in primary transformants  though with varying efficiencies ( brooks et  al .  2014 ; zhang et  al .  2014 ; zhou et  al .  2014  2015 )  
 interestingly  the most efficient and consistent crispr / cas9 editing was reported in hybrid populus tremula x alba clone 717 - 1b4 ( 717 )  with biallelic mutations detected in all independent transgenic lines examined ( zhou et  al .  2015 ) . 
 for woody perennials such as forest trees  fruit / nut trees and woody ornamentals with highly heterologous genomes and long generation times  crispr / cas9 affords a facile means to accelerate genetic improvement . 
 the first application of crispr / cas9 genome editing in populus targeted the 4-coumarate : coa ligase ( 4cl ) gene family involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism ( zhou et  al .  2015 ) . 
 one of the genes  4cl1 ( potri.001g036900 )  has been extensively characterized for its involvement in lignin biosynthesis . 
 down - regulation of 4cl1 or its orthologs leads to reduced lignin content and altered lignin structure in a number of species ( boerjan et  al .  
 thus  crispr / cas9 editing of 4cl1 served as a proof - of - concept study  allowing an assessment of its efficacy in perturbing lignin biosynthesis relative to previous methods . 
 we generated 36 independent transgenic lines  and amplicon - sequencing of randomly selected events confirmed biallelic mutations in all cases ( zhou et  al .  2015 ) . 
 as frequently reported for crispr / cas9 genome editing  small indels  especially 1-bp modifications  were the predominant patterns and predicted to disrupt the reading frame . 
 consistent with this prediction  lignin content was reduced by 23% with a concomitant decrease of s / g lignin ratio by 30% in all transgenic plants ( zhou et  al .  2015 ) . 
 wood discoloration is a known side effect of lignin modification frequently observed in transgenic plants with suppressed lignin gene expression . 
 however  the coloration patterns reported in those cases lack the uniformity we observed for the crispr / cas9 mutants . for example 
  antisense downregulation of 4cl1 in populus resulted in patchy wood discoloration in only 5 of 14 transgenic lines ( voelker et  al .  
 wood discoloration patterns of transgenic populus with down - regulated expression of cinnamoyl - coa reductase were highly variable among vegetatively propagated plants ( van acker et  al .  2014 )  presumably due to the unstable nature of sense- or antisense - mediated post - transcriptional gene silencing . 
 rnai - mediated gene suppression is considered a more effective alternative  with improved trait stability ( li et  al .  2008 ) . 
 for instance  rnai - silencing of 4-coumaroyl - coa 3-hydroxylase in transgenic populus resulted in lignin reductions among 9 independent events that ranged from no change to 1560% ( coleman et  al .  
 similarly  rnai silencing of 4cl in pinus led to wood discoloration in only 2 of 12 viable transgenic lines ( wagner et  al .  2009 ) . 
 by contrast  the homogeneity of wood discoloration both within and across independent crispr / cas9-edited populus mutant lines is consistent with a null 4cl1  and resembles that of naturally occurring  brown midrib  mutants of maize and sorghum ( sattler et  al .  2010 ) . 
 the results serve as testament to the superiority of crispr / cas9 over previous gene silencing methods . 
 ( 2015 ) with permission . a second gene  4cl2 ( potri.019g049500 ) that is phylogenetically distinct from lignin - associated 4cls ( chen et  al .  2014 ) . 
 has long been suggested to participate in flavonoid biosynthesis  based solely on its preferential expression in epidermis and roots ( harding et  al .  2002 ) . 
 crispr / cas9 mutation of 4cl2 was therefore expected to yield functional evidence to substantiate this role . as with the 4cl1 case 
  biallelic mutations were observed in all independent transgenic lines surveyed by amplicon - sequencing ( zhou et  al .  
 the metabolic consequence was examined in roots where flavonoid - derived condensed tannins ( cts ) are known to accumulate to high levels ( 20% dry weight ) in the experimental poplar genotype ( chen et  al .  2014 ) . 
 crispr / cas9 mutations of 4cl2 resulted in significantly reduced levels of condensed tannins in roots  providing reverse genetics evidence in support of class ii 4cl function in flavonoid biosynthesis . 
 after our initial publication  successful crispr / cas9 editing was reported for populus tomentosa ( fan et  al .  2015 ) . 
 that study targeted a phytoene desaturase ( pds ) gene for mutagenesis by multiplexing 4 grnas  and observed a 50% frequency of albino phenotypes . 
 the lower mutation rates compared to our study may be attributed to gene redundancy and sequence heterozygosity that were not accounted for during grna design ( see discussion below ) . 
 regardless  selected albino transgenic lines were sequence - confirmed to harbor biallelic mutations ( fan et  al .  2015 )  providing additional support for the superior phenotypic uniformity of crispr / cas9 mutants . 
 a major concern in genome editing is the specificity of the dna modification  as off - target cleavage due to non - specific crispr / cas9 activity may cause unintended mutations . 
 this is especially true for plant genomes that are characterized by recurring episodes of whole - genome  segmental and tandem duplications . 
 we assessed crispr / cas9 specificity in populus by analyzing its on - target versus off - target activities among duplicated genes . 
 the grna for 4cl1 was designed to discriminate against the paralogous 4cl5 ( potri.003g188500 )  with 3 mismatches in the target sequence and one mismatch in the protospacer adjacent motif ( pam ) ( zhou et  al .  2015 ) . 
 by designing consensus primers flanking the target site  we were able to sequence both 4cl1 and 4cl5 amplicons simultaneously to assess the specificity of crispr / cas9 . 
 a custom program  ageseq ( analysis of genome editing by sequencing )  was developed to facilitate variant detection ( xue and tsai  2015 ) . 
 no off - target cleavage in the 4cl5 locus was detected in 4cl1-edited lines  suggesting that crispr / cas9 editing in populus is highly specific ( zhou et  al .  2015 ) . 
 negative  experiment  where mismatches between a 4cl5-grna  designed based on the p. trichocarpa reference genome ( phytozome v3 )  and the corresponding sequence of p. tremula x alba 717 used for transformation abolished cleavage in all transgenic lines examined ( zhou et  al .  2015 ) . 
 in this case  the mismatches were in the form of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps )  one per allele  located near or in the pam . 
 these results  together with the highly heterologous nature of woody perennials  suggest that off - target cleavage of crispr / cas9 is likely to be low in these species . 
 the ability of crispr / cas9 to discriminate single - base differences makes it a powerful tool to investigate functional redundancy of highly homologous genes that are otherwise difficult to discern using gene silencing approaches . 
 for instance  4cl1 is the most abundantly expressed isoform in populus xylem  constituting > 85% of 4cl transcripts  with 4cl5 being a distant second  based on rna - seq data ( swamy et  al .  2015 ) . 
 however  the crispr / cas9 knockout of 4cl1 reduced lignin content only by 23% ( zhou et  al .  2015 ) . because the 4cl5 locus was unmodified  
 it is likely involved in the residual lignin biosynthesis of the 4cl1-knockout mutants . in the populus study that targeted pds  
 4 grnas were designed based on one gene model ( potri.014g148700 ) without considering the genome duplicate ( potri.002g235200 ) that shares a high degree ( 93% ) of coding sequence identity . while the genome sequence of p. tomentosa is not yet available  analysis of the p. trichocarpa and p. tremula x alba orthologs revealed different degrees of sequence variation between the 2 duplicates in the grna target regions . 
 these differences ( plus unknown allelic heterozygosity ) likely contributed to the variation in the reported editing efficiencies of different grnas ( fan et  al .  2015 ) . 
 examples include designing multigene - targeting grnas based on conserved sequences of homologous genes ( brooks et  al .  2014 ; jacobs et  al .  2015 )  or multiplexing individual grna cassettes ( brooks et  al .  2014 ; fan et  al .  2015 ; zhang et  al .  2014 
 a recent study hijacked the trna processing machinery for efficient processing of up to 8  and potentially more  grnas from one single construct ( xie et  al . 
  the grna is positioned downstream of trna as a polycistronic gene with repeating trna - grna units for multiplexing ( xie et  al .  2015 ) . because mature grnas are released following cleavage of the polycistronic transcript by the trna processing machinery 
  there is no sequence constraint at the 5 end of grnas ( xie et  al .  2015 ) . 
 this greatly simplifies grna design  as any sequences upstream of pam ( ngg ) can be used ( e.g.  n20-ngg or other truncated lengths ( fu et  al .  2014 ) )  unlike with the standard design where grna is transcribed directly from the pol iii u6 or u3 promoter using a specific transcription initiation sequence ( e.g.  gn19-ngg or an19-ngg  respectively ) ( wang et  al .  2008 ) . 
 in some cases  grna stacking  either by re - transformation or via controlled crosses of primary transformants may be necessary in order to discern individual gene functions . 
 as discussed above  numerous studies have exploited sequence polymorphisms for developing gene- or allele - specific grnas to achieve precision editing by crispr / cas9 . 
 however  few studies have addressed the added complexity of sequence polymorphisms on crispr / cas9 genome editing  probably because the common plant models  such as arabidopsis  rice  soybean and tomato  are selfing species with homozygous genomes . 
 we argue that sequence polymorphisms are of concern in genome editing of most flowering plants  especially woody perennials that are outcrossing in nature . 
 this is supported by the high frequency of genic snps reported for trees  one per 60  bp in populus tremula ( ingvarsson  2005 ) or one per 16 - 33  bp in eucalyptus depending on the species ( klheim et  al .  2009 ) . 
 a recent population genomics study of 544 populus trichocarpa individuals identified 17.9 million ( m ) snps by whole - genome resequencing ( evans et  al .  2014 ) . using a similar approach with both resequencing and rna - seq data 
  we uncovered over 10  m snps from a single individual  p. tremula x alba clone 717 that is commonly used in populus transformation ( xue et  al .  2015 ) . 
 given the high levels of heterozygosity in tree species  the need to consider sequence polymorphisms in genome editing experiments can not be over - emphasized . 
 in fact  most published genome sequences are  by default  consensus sequences of their ( pseudo)haploid genomes . 
 thus  while several web - based grna design programs are available for plants  such as crispr - plant ( xie et  al .  2014 ) . and 
 crispr - p ( lei et  al .  2014 )  their utility for outcrossing species is limited because the preloaded genome sequences lack biallelic ( or multiploid ) coverage . furthermore  it is often the case as in populus that the species or genotype chosen for whole genome sequencing ( e.g.   p. trichocarpa nisqually-1 ) is different from that routinely used for genetic transformation ( e.g.  p. tremula x alba 717 ) . to facilitate crispr / cas9 genome editing in 717 
  we constructed a custom 717 genome by substituting > 10  m sequence variants into the p. trichocarpa reference genome ( xue et  al .  2015 ) . 
 we then assessed the impact of sequence polymorphisms on grna specificity for 1000 randomly selected genes . 
 grnas were designed based on the haploid genome of ( 1 ) p. trichocarpa or ( 2 ) 717  and then cross - checked for snps or indels in the 717 target sequences . from the first analysis  we found that more than 57% of the grnas designed based on the p. trichocarpa genome correspond to regions that harbor snps or indels in 717 ( xue et  al . 
 the rates were slightly lower but nevertheless high ( 42 - 44% ) in the second analysis when the custom 717 genome was used  owing to allelic variations ( zhou et  al .  2015 ) . 
 together  these data suggest that standard grna designs may suffer from a high probability of failure in crispr / cas9 genome editing  due to the frequent occurrence of snps / indels in outcrossers . 
 the 717 sequences and associated blast and gene model query tools are available via aspendb ( http://aspendb.uga.edu/s717 ) . 
 tool is particularly useful for screening custom grnas or pcr primers against known snps / indels in the p. trichocarpa or the custom 717 genome ( xue et  al .  2015 ) . 
 a set of pre - selected grnas with no known sequence variants for 38509 populus genes is provided ( zhou et  al .  2015 ) . 
 the modified  variant - sensitive pipeline for grna design  called  aspen crispr designer   is also available at aspendb and can be applied to other species . for outcrossing species lacking a genomic variant database  several approaches can be applied to identify snps / indels in the gene(s ) of interest prior to grna selection . 
 rna - seq data from the transformation genotype  when available  is an excellent source for high - confidence snp discovery . 
 provided that the gene of interest is reasonably expressed ( e.g.   with a high read coverage )  manual inspection of candidate grnas against rna - seq alignments using programs such as the popular integrative genomics viewer ( http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv ) is usually effective to confirm their specificity . in the absence of deep - sequencing data  pcr primers ( with or without degeneracy 
 ) can be designed to amplify the target gene coding region based on a closely - related reference genome  or on conserved amino acid sequences of orthologs as in conventional rt - pcr cloning ( hu et  al .  1998 ) . 
 as pam ( ngg)the only sequence constraint in grna design  occurs frequently  it is not necessary to obtain full - length gene sequences . 
 however  the use of multiple primer pairs is recommended to increase the likelihood of capturing both alleles . 
 direct sequencing of pcr products to identify sequence variants is an established practice in molecular ecology research  and several programs have been developed to decode overlapping sanger chromatograms ( dmitriev and rakitov  2008 ) . for researchers with convenient access to high - throughput sequencing  
 sequence reads can then be processed by ageseq to search for potential variants in the target gene sequences ( xue and tsai  2015 ) . 
 ageseq is available as a standalone program or a galaxy - compatible tool ( https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu ) to support web - based data analysis . 
 it should be noted that pcr amplification of noncoding sequences can be tricky due to the lower degree of sequence conservation ( xue et  al .  2015 ) . 
 thus  for crispr / cas9 applications that target promoter or other noncoding sequences ( e.g.  transcriptional activation or chromatin modification ( sander and joung  2014 ) )  resequencing of the transformation clone for unbiased variant calling  as discussed above for populus 717 ( xue et  al .  2015 )  is recommended . 
 the populus study extended the ever growing list of plant species successfully genome - edited by crispr / cas9 ( bortesi and fischer  2015 ; kumar and jain  2015 ) to woody perennials . 
 woody perennials suffer as experimental systems due to the lengthiness of genetic transformation and plant characterization . 
 many forest and horticultural tree species and genotypes are notoriously recalcitrant to tissue culture regeneration with low transformation efficiencies ( litz and padilla  2012 ; busov et  al .  2005 ) . 
 limitations associated with other established technologies  such as incomplete silencing  position effects or epigenetic modifications of transgenes ( matzke and matzke  1998 )  further impede progress in transgenic tree research . even for species with a facile transformation system  such as populus tremula x alba 717  the common practice of generating multiple independent events for preliminary screening prior to in - depth characterization of selected lines is resource - demanding and time - consuming ( fig .  2 ) . 
 the ability of crispr / cas9 to generate null mutations in primary transformants  and the promise of phenotypic consistency among independent biallelic mutants as demonstrated in the populus study make a compelling argument that it may soon become acceptable to characterize only a few transgenic lines with sequence - verified mutations . 
 high - throughput methods for mapping genome editing patterns ( xue and tsai  2015 ) and transgene ( e.g.  t - dna harboring cas9  grna and selectable marker ) insertion sites ( kanizay et  al .  2015 ) 
 are expected to facilitate this effort . as depicted in figure  2  primary transformants with confirmed editing can be used directly for in - depth characterization when multiple independent events are available as biological replicates ( zhou et  al .  2015 ) . 
 even when only a few mutation events are obtained ( for difficult - to - transform species or from suboptimal transformation trials )  the ability to bypass rna - level screening and to obtain stable mutations still confers advantages over the gene - silencing approaches . 
 crispr / cas9 thus offers the enticing prospect of streamlined transgenic characterization and expedited large - scale functional characterization . 
 figure 2.schematic comparisons of experimental approaches involving gene silencing vs. crispr / cas9 genome editing . 
 ( a ) for gene silencing by antisense  sense or rnai approaches  knowledge about the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the target gene is used to select an appropriate promoter for construct preparation . 
 expression knowledge is not necessary for crispr / cas9 editing at the dna level  and vectors with a pol iii promoter ( e.g.  u6 or u3 ) for grna expression and a cas9 under control of a constitutive ( e.g.  35s ) promoter are widely applicable . 
 ( b ) following regeneration of putative transgenic plants  conventional screening involves pcr confirmation of transgenes followed by expression analysis to select events with desired ( or maximum ) levels of gene suppression . 
 it is common to screen a large number of events ( 10 ) to identify a minimum of 3 for subsequent analysis . 
 this process can be greatly simplified with crispr / cas9 mutants  as dna level analysis by amplicon sequencing can identify events with biallelic mutations for further analysis . 
 ( c ) for species with a robust transformation system  multiple biallelic crispr / cas9 events can be used directly as biological replicates for in - depth characterization . in case of difficult - to - transform species for which few biallelic events may be obtained  
 micropropagation is necessary to obtain biological replicates before in - depth characterization  as is typically done using gene silencing .

 biallelic mutations of the target gene(s ) in conjunction with the hemizygous nature of transgene ( e.g.  t - dna ) integration in primary transformants ( t0 ) means that dna - edited but transgene - free progenies can be readily obtained from t1 segregants  as demonstrated in annual species ( zhang et  al . 
 trait stacking with early flowering induction is thus highly desirable  for example by over - expression of flowering locus t ( ft ) as demonstrated in prunus ( plum )  populus and eucalyptus ( hoenicka et  al .  2014 ; 
 another concern for outcrossing species is that the progenies will be different from the parents  which necessitates additional screening and selection . 
 we note  however  that introgressing transgenic / mutant events into elite genotypes is an established practice in crop and tree breeding programs  and hence not unique to crispr / cas9-edited mutants . 
 a well - known tree example is the loblolly pine ( pinus taeda ) clone 756 that harbors a naturally occurring null allele of cinnamoyl alcohol dehydrogenase involved in lignin biosynthesis  and that is extensively used as a parent in several breeding programs in the us ( gill et  al .  2003 ) . 
 another example is early - flowering ft - plum that serves as a parent in the fasttrack breeding program to expedite development of improved commercial cultivars ( callahan et  al .  
 various molecular and genomics tools are available to facilitate progeny selection in transgenic breeding programs . 
 recently  virus - based systems have been explored for transient expression of genome - engineering reagents ( ali et  al . 
 however  such systems still utilize t - dna to express the repurposed viral genome components  and the resulting plants are not transgene - free without crossing . 
 these methods also depend on agroinfiltration to deliver the vector into plant cells  which unfortunately is not applicable to most woody species with an open minor vein structure in their leaves ( gamalei  1989 ) . clearly  
 development of innovative methods will be necessary for facile removal of t - dna from the genome - edited plants without crossing . 
 regardless  null segregants of crop cultivars derived from genome editing are indistinguishable from naturally occurring or chemically - induced mutants  and may therefore be exempt from gmo regulation in countries that adhere to product - based regulations ( voytas and gao  2014 ) . 
 this is expected to significantly reduce the timeline and financial burden associated with developing new crop varieties  thereby encouraging adoption of crispr / cas9-based genome editing for the forest products  fruit / tree nuts  and woody ornamental industries .

1) Abstract: 
CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized genome editing with its precision, efficiency, versatility, and ease of adoption. Its successful application in woody perennials, such as populus, has expanded its use in outcrossing species with frequent occurrence of sequence polymorphisms.

2) Research and Discussion: 
Despite its benefits, CRISPR/Cas9 can be hindered by allelic heterozygosity in outcrossing species. This section discusses experimental and computational evidence for this sensitivity, and highlights strategies and tools that can overcome these sequence variations. Additionally, CRISPR/Cas9 offers a more definitive approach for deciphering functional redundancy in paralogous genes found in plant genomes.

3) Results and Conclusion: 
Continuing advancements in CRISPR/Cas9 for multiplex genome engineering will further aid in addressing allelic heterozygosity in outcrossing species. CRISPR/Cas9 has the potential to accelerate not only basic research but also applied crop improvement projects, making it a valuable technology for future advancements in genome editing. "
"like co@fe3o4  which recently underwent extensive study to 
 elucidate both the 
 oxidative stability of the core and the phase of the shell  fept@fe3o4 core 
 shell 
 nanoparticles can be used as building blocks to form nanocomposites 
 with enhanced magnetic properties with the potential for novel applications . 
 these include magnetic data storage  catalysis  and targeted drug 
 delivery . in terms of nanomagnetics specifically  our hope 
 is that the presence of an inert oxide shell may function to inhibit 
 agglomeration of the cores upon annealing ; this is a necessary step 
 in creating an ordered l10 fept bimetallic structure with 
 a higher magnetic coercivity . 
 the determination of the core composition 
 is important for tailoring their synthesis in order to ultimately 
 achieve the desired 50:50 fept alloy composition . a solution 
 of core 
 shell particles was drop - cast onto a 3 mm holey carbon 
 copper grid . 
 edx data were acquired using an fei osiris tem equipped 
 with a high brightness schottky x - feg gun and a super - x edx system 
 comprising four silicon drift detectors  each approximately 30 mm in area and arranged symmetrically around an optic axis to 
 achieve a collection solid angle of 0.9 sr . 
 edx data were 
 collected in the form of spectrum images  in which a focused electron 
 probe was scanned in a raster across a region of interest in the scanning 
 tem ( stem ) . at each point in the scan  
 structural information was 
 obtained from the electron scattering incident on a high angle annular 
 dark field ( haadf ) detector  and simultaneously  an edx spectrum was 
 obtained by collecting x - rays emitted from the local volume probed 
 by the electron beam . 
 the resulting edx spectrum image was a three - dimensional 
 data set whose ( x  y ) axes correspond 
 to the position of the probe and whose z axis corresponds 
 to the energy of the detected x - ray . 
 spectrum images were acquired 
 with a probe current of approximately 0.7 na  an acceleration voltage 
 of 200 kv  a spatial sampling of between 0.5 and 1 nm / pixel and 50100 
 ms / pixel dwell times . 
 x - ray intensities were obtained 
 by fitting a model of the edx spectra to the experimental data using 
 weighted least - squares and atomic fractions were quantified from intensities 
 using the cliff  lorimer quantification . 
 the edx model and the 
 quantification were implemented in hyperspy and will be available 
 in future releases of the software . 
 figure 1a displays a haadf stem image obtained 
 during the acquisition of a spectrum image enclosing a cluster of 
 13 co@fe3o4 nanoparticles . 
 although the particle 
 morphologies are seen to vary slightly from one particle to another  
 the majority of particles have a round core approximately 20 nm in 
 diameter surrounded by a thin shell approximately 5 nm in thickness . 
 the edx elemental maps for cobalt  iron  and oxygen ( figure 1b  d )  obtained by integration of the element s 
 background - subtracted k - line x - ray peak  show that individual particles 
 are comprised of a cobalt core surrounded by a shell composed of iron 
 and oxygen  as expected . 
 the largest particle in the lower left region 
 of the map appears to have more iron in the core compared to the smaller 
 particles . 
 these conventional edx element maps show the location of 
 the various elements  but the composition of the particle core  for 
 example  can not be determined by elemental mapping due to the presence 
 of the shell above and below the core in projection . 
 elemental maps of ( b ) cobalt  
 ( c ) iron  and ( d ) oxygen display the location of the various elements 
 with respect to the particle morphology ( scale bar = 50 nm  greyscale 
 = x - ray counts ) . 
 the edx spectrum image 
 data of the co@fe3o4 nanoparticle cluster shown 
 in figure 1a was 
 subsequently processed using bss methods in hyperspy . 
 first  the 
 spectral dimension in the data set was binned by four from 5 ev / channel 
 to 20 ev / channel in order to increase the number of counts per channel . 
 next  
 we note that the binning 
 step is necessary in order to optimize the accuracy of the variance 
 stabilization channel . 
 the first three principal 
 components  pc#0  pc#1  and pc#2  exhibited significantly greater 
 variance than the remaining components ( figure 2a )  which suggests that there are only three phases present in the 
 sample . 
 that being the case  those three pca components should be 
 a linear combination of the spectra and distribution maps of those 
 phases  but the mixing matrix is unknown . 
 next  we compute numerically 
 the first derivative of the pca spectral components in order to diminish 
 the correlation caused by the edx background  and we use fastica to estimate the mixing matrix and compute the 
 independent components ( ics ) ic#0  ic#1  and ic#2 ( figure 2b ) and their distribution maps ( figure 2c  e ) from the pca results . component independence 
 is a much more stringent property than uncorrelatedness imposed by 
 pca . 
 if we disregard the small copper peaks contained 
 in all the independent components  likely originating from the copper 
 support mesh  we see that ic#0 contains cobalt x - ray peaks  ic#1 iron 
 and oxygen peaks  and ic#2 a carbon peak . 
 the three ics appear to 
 belong to the three phases present in the originally scanned area : 
 the core  shell  and supporting film . 
 this hypothesis is explored 
 further in the next section . at this point  however  it is important 
 to note that  unlike in the conventional edx mapping shown in figure 1  no elements were selected prior to performing 
 ica  and thus  the analysis is free of external bias  except for the 
 choice of the number of components . 
 result of bss by pca and ica of an edx 
 si of a co@fe3o4 core 
 ( b ) corresponding independent 
 component spectra contain the expected x - ray lines for the elements 
 present . 
 independent component maps ( c  e ) show that ( c ) ic#0 
 is concentrated in the nanoparticle cores  ( d ) ic#1 in the shells  
 and ( e ) ic#2 everywhere on the carbon supporting film ( scale = 50 
 nm  greyscale = normalized weighting ) . 
 we now move on to the analysis of a second cluster of particles 
 comprised of a bimetallic iron / platinum core surrounded by an iron 
 oxide shell . 
 a crystalline core surrounded by a polycrystalline oxide 
 shell is observed in the representative high - resolution stem haadf 
 image shown in figure 3 . 
 the 
 particle morphologies were found to have 
 a mean core diameter of approximately 3.3 nm and mean shell thickness 
 of approximately 1.7 nm ( figure 4a ) . also visible 
 were pure iron oxide particles ( in the lower right - hand corner of 
 figure 4a ) . 
 ica of a cluster of bimetallic platinum / iron 
 nanoparticle seeds

 scree plot of the first 50 principal components showing the first 
 three components lying above the noise . 
 ( c  e ) element maps 
 of ( c ) platinum  ( d ) iron  and ( e ) oxygen . ( f  h ) . 
 the ic maps 
 ( f ) ic#0  ( g ) ic#1  and ( h ) ic#2 and ( i ) the corresponding ic spectra . from the selected element maps 
 ( figure 4c 
 e )  it is clear that  with 
 the exception of the two particles 
 in the lower right - hand corner  the particles are comprised of a platinum 
 rich core surrounded by an iron oxide shell . 
 however  it is not clear 
 from the maps alone whether iron is present in the core . by conventional 
 elemental 
 mapping  one can not tell whether the particles contain a 
 pure platinum core surrounded by an iron oxide shell or whether iron 
 is alloyed with platinum to form a bimetallic core . 
 we now address 
 these questions by performing bss on the same edx 
 spectrum image using the same procedure detailed before . 
 once again  
 by inspecting the scree plot ( figure 4b )  we 
 find that the sample consists of three phases . 
 the spatial distribution 
 of ic#0 is concentrated in the particle cores  ic#1 in a shell around 
 the cores  and ic#2 is approximately uniformly distributed over the 
 map ( figure 4f  h ) . if we again disregard 
 the spurious copper peak  ic#0 contains iron and platinum x - ray peaks  
 ic#1 iron and oxygen peaks  and ic#2 a single carbon peak ( figure 4i ) . from this analysis 
 it appears that the ica components 
 represent the different phases present in the edx spectrum image ; 
 ic#0  ic#1  and ic#2 genuinely represent the bimetallic fept cores  
 iron oxide shells and the carbon support  respectively . in order 
 to verify the accuracy of the ica results  we evaluated 
 whether ic#0 represented the true composition of the core by analyzing 
 bare fept seed particle clusters obtained from the same chemical synthesis 
 but extracted prior to the shell addition step . 
 being made from the 
 same synthesis  the composition of the bimetallic seed particles are 
 expected to match to the composition of the bimetallic cores in the 
 core  shell particles analyzed in figure 4 . 
 a total of 12 edx sis were acquired in order to capture and 
 analyze 
 multiple fept bimetallic seed clusters . 
 the segmentation of one of 
 the edx sis is shown in figure 5a  b . to accurately extract the intensity of the fe k and pt l 
 peaks  a model composed of one gaussian per x - ray line and 
 a background 
 based on kramers and small expressions as developed elsewhere was used  as shown in green in figure 5c . 
 the only free parameters of the model were the 
 area of the gaussian and the height of the background  which was negligible . 
 the mean reduced  over the fit of all particles 
 was 1.01  indicating that the discrepancies between the model and 
 the data are in accordance with the poisson noise variance . the intensities 
 of fe k and pt l peaks in the fitted model were quantified 
 using the cliff  lorimer method . 
 the obtained compositions are 
 plotted for each particle in figure 5d along 
 with the fitting error estimated from poisson statistics . 
 the raw 
 data were decomposed using pca on all fept seed data and the first 
 three components were retained for noise reduction . 
 the 103 individual 
 fept bimetallic seeds analyzed were found to have a mean composition 
 of 82.0 at . 
 % pt  which lies well within one standard deviation of 
 the average bimetallic seed composition . 
 the data points in figure 5d are displayed in order of ascending particle size . 
 as such  the calculated compositions on the right - hand side tend to 
 have a smaller error bar on account of the signal  noise ratio 
 being higher for larger particles . 
 the compositions of the larger 
 seed particles are also closer to the mean composition and to the 
 composition of ic#0  confirming the homogeneity of the composition 
 and the validity of the bss analysis .

 a comparison 
 of raw edx spectra extracted 
 from fept bimetallic seed particles and from pure fe3o4 particles with ic#0 and ic#1  respectively  is provided in 
 figure 6 . in both cases  
 the ics were scaled 
 by a constant to obtain a best fit to the raw spectra . despite the 
 strong overall agreement in each case  
 the carbon peak difference in both cases is 
 caused by the separation of carbon into a different component ( ic#2 ) . 
 the difference in the shell cu peaks are not due to a compositional 
 difference as the cu signal is spurious in origin . 
 the iron oxide 
 particle spectrum also contains small silicon and sulfur peaks which 
 likely originate from residue on the carbon film . 
 the difference in 
 the pt m core peak may be due to the attenuation of pt m 
 x - rays in the shell of the core  shell nanoparticles and in 
 nearby particles along the trajectory to the detector . 
 the strong 
 overall similarity between the raw and ic spectra provide direct evidence 
 showing that the spectral components extracted by ica from the core  shell 
 spectrum image data are strongly representative of the buried core  
 surrounding shell  and carbon support compositions .

 when analyzing beam - sensitive materials  the main 
 limitation to 
 the accuracy of the bss analysis method that we propose is the intensity 
 of the edx signal achievable without inducing significant sample damage . 
 in our case  despite the use of a high efficiency edx system  
 the 
 number of collected x - rays is low . in order to avoid the artifacts 
 that arise 
 when using the variance - stabilizing transformation out 
 of its domain of application  we have binned the data by four in the spectral dimension from 5 ev / channel to 
 20 ev / channel . 
 given that the resolution of our edx detector is approximately 
 130 ev at mn k and that there were no overlapping x - ray lines  
 in our case  the increase in the number of counts per channel ( and 
 hence in the accuracy of the analysis ) comes without significant resolution 
 loss and  therefore  should not have any adverse effect in the analysis . 
 a blind source separation method based 
 on pca and ica has been applied to the analysis of edx spectrum images 
 of core 
 the analysis has accurately 
 determined the number of phases in the analyzed volume ( core  shell  
 and supporting film ) as well as their spectra and distribution maps . 
 we have confirmed the accuracy of the analysis by comparing the calculated 
 spectra from the platinum  iron core and the iron oxide shell 
 to those obtained from these structures in isolation  and the excellent 
 agreement suggests that bss  therefore  can be used to accurately 
 analyze edx data . 
 the use of ica on edx spectrum image data promises 
 to be a powerful technique for extracting buried compositions at the 
 nanoscale in a variety of materials  and further testing on the method s 
 applicability to different systems is now being initiated .","

1) Abstract: The chemical composition of core-shell nanoparticle clusters has been determined through PCA and ICA analysis of an EDX spectrum image acquired in a STEM. The method blindly decomposes the image into three components representing the carbon film, shell, and bimetallic core, which was further verified through separate quantification. 

2) Research and Discussion: Through PCA and ICA analysis, the EDX spectrum image of core-shell nanoparticle clusters was successfully decomposed into three components representing the carbon film, shell, and bimetallic core.

3) Results and Conclusion: The blind decomposition method of PCA and ICA analysis accurately determined the chemical composition of the core-shell nanoparticle clusters. This was further verified by separate quantification, showing excellent agreement. This method provides a reliable approach for analyzing core-shell nanoparticle clusters in STEM, making it an effective tool for studying their properties and potential applications."
"ionic calcium ( ca ) controls multiple cellular signaling processes in all eukaryotic cells  including proliferation  gene expression  and neurotransmitter release . 
 ca - binding proteins such as calmodulin play a pivotal role in ca signal transmission and amplification . 
 increases in the concentration of intracellular ca activate specific protein targets  among which the ca / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ii ( camkii ) is a critical signal mediator . in response to an increase in intracellular ca  thr-286 of camkii 
 the coupling of ca - calmodulin to one of the camkii subunits allows for the phosphorylation of an adjacent subunit at thr . 
 calmodulin trapping   confers ca - calmodulin - independent kinase activity to the complex and thus prolongs the ca signal . 
 thus  calmodulin trapping represents a molecular mechanism of memory  which is defined as the capacity to acquire  store ( consolidate )  and retrieve ( evocate ) information . 
 camkii is a major synaptic protein that is activated during the induction of long - term potentiation ( ltp ) by ca influx through n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) receptors . 
 calmodulin trapping allows camkii to remain activated long after the initial ca signal has dissipated  suggesting that camkii is a memory molecule crucial for ltp . 
 consistent with this notion  camkii - null mice present with impaired memory formation  and camkii is essential for genesis and maintenance of ltp in postsynaptic neurons . 
 following presynaptic stimulation  camkii is activated in postsynaptic neurons  which creates a physiological imprint of the initial ca signal  and increases translocation of nmda receptors to the plasma membrane . 
 because of its capacity to remain activated long after the initial pulse of ca signaling  camkii perpetuates ca effects and modulates gene expression and the epigenetic profile of postsynaptic neurons . 
 camkii also participates in glucose - stimulated insulin secretion ( gsis )  as multiple insulin secretagogues increase camkii activity . in the perfused rat pancreas  
 the dynamics of camkii activation correlate with the amplitude of gsis  and camkii activation is temporally associated with insulin secretion . 
 camkii is essential for appropriate gsis and is involved in several steps of this process  including the synthesis of insulin granules  the modulation of cytoplasmic content of atp  and the activation of synapsin . 
 importantly  camkii also regulates transcription factors central for  - cell function such as creb   and mafa . here 
  we investigated whether pancreatic  - cells  like neurons  acquire and store the information contained in calcium pulses as a form of  metabolic memory  . 
 indeed  we find that  - cells retain memory of prior activation  and describe the molecular mechanism that contributes to this memory . 
 min6 insulinoma cells or mouse or human pancreatic islets were distributed into three groups : control  pulse  and pulse  +  kn93 ( 10  m ) . 
 initially  all groups were maintained in the same medium with 5.6  mm glucose for 24  h. after this acclimation period  the control group was exposed to 3-mm glucose for 24  h  while the pulse and pulse  +  kn93 ( 10  m ) groups were exposed to 30  mm of glucose for four 1-h  periods intercalated with 7-hour periods of 3  mm glucose . 
 kn93 ( a camkii inhibitor ) at 10  m was only present during the 30  mm glucose pulses . 
 all groups were then maintained at 3  mm glucose for a 24-h consolidation period . 
 insulin secretion of min6 cells   and mouse pancreatic islets   was conducted following standard procedures  and insulin was measured by ria . 
 one hundred and fifty islets were handpicked under a light microscope and pre - incubated for 1  h  in krbb ( krebs bicarbonate buffer ) containing 0.3 
 the medium was discarded and the islets incubated for an additional hour in 500-l krbb containing 2.8 or 16.8  mm glucose . 
 subsequently  the supernatant was collected to evaluate insulin secretion by ria . for perifusion assays  
 150 treated human islets were placed into a perifusion chamber ( millipore  billerica  ma  usa ) . a computer - controlled fast - performance hplc system allowed programmable rates of flow and concentrations of the appropriate solutions held in a 37  c water bath . 
 islets were perfused for 80  min  with krbb in the absence of glucose  followed by krbb with increasing concentrations of glucose ( glucose was ramped from 0 to 30  mm at 0.75  mm / min ) . at the end of each experiment  islets were tested for maximal insulin secretion by adding 30  mm kcl to the perifusate . 
 samples were collected at 2  ml / min and insulin content was determined by using ria . 
 statistical analyses were performed using student 's t - test or a two - way anova with a bonferroni 's posttest  as required . statistical significance was set at p  <  0.05 . 
 in order to investigate metabolic memory of insulin - producing  - cells  we first had to develop a paradigm in which such memory was evident . 
 as detailed below  we established that exposure of cultured min6  - cells to four 1-h  pulses of high glucose  interspersed with 7-h  intervals of low glucose and thus mimicking postprandial glucose spikes in  vivo  were able to elicit robust metabolic memory . the detailed experimental paradigm is outlined in figure  1a . 
 as shown in figure  1b  min6  - cells exposed to the glucose pulse regimen showed higher insulin secretion both when exposed to low ( 2.8  mm ) or high ( 16.8  mm ) glucose than  - cells  which had been cultured continuously at low glucose . 
 this increase in insulin secretion was accompanied by a significant rise in the levels of phosphorylated camkii  consistent with the notion that camkii might be a molecular mediator of this metabolic memory ( figure  1c and d ) . 
 importantly  both the increases in basal and stimulated insulin secretion in the glucose pulse group were abolished by kn93 ( figure  1b )  a specific camkii inhibitor . 
 next  we evaluated the kinetics of the  - cell response to acute glucose exposure  and observed that the pulse group secreted more insulin at basal ( time zero ) and stimulatory concentrations of glucose ( 16.7  mm ) between 5 and 60  min following stimulation ( figure  1e ) . 
 this effect persisted even after glucose concentrations were returned to 2.8  mm . in parallel  the phosphorylation of camkii was higher in the glucose pulse group at both glucose concentrations  and remained elevated even after the glucose concentration was reduced to 2.8  mm ( figure  1f ) . 
 thus  min6  - cells had acquired metabolic memory of prior exposure to glucose pulses  which they retained through a 24-h  consolidation period . 
 it was important to determine if metabolic memory is confined to min6 insulinoma cells  or if it is also a property of primary human  - cells . 
 therefore  we cultured human islets from multiple non - diabetic deceased organ donors ( see table  1 for donor information ) and exposed them to pulses of 30  mm glucose in the same paradigm as described above . 
 pulse treatment increased insulin secretion at basal ( 2.8  mm ) and stimulatory ( 16.8  mm ) glucose concentrations ( figure  2a ) . as was the case in min6  - cells  
 the pulse group showed increased camkii phosphorylation at both basal and stimulatory glucose concentrations ( figure  2b ) . 
 next  we determined the human islet response to a glucose challenge in the islet perifusion assay . 
 islets from the glucose pulse group showed both increased first and second phase insulin secretion compared with islets from the control group ( figure  2c and d ) . 
 as before  these effects were abolished by the camkii inhibitor kn93 ( figure  2a  d ) . 
 we also tested metabolic memory of  - cells using isolated mouse pancreatic islets  with similar outcome ( extended data figure  1 ) 
 . we also found  using live cell calcium imaging of mouse islets  that the increases in cytoplasmic calcium levels following acute glucose stimulation  representing the penultimate step in insulin secretion  are significantly higher in the pulse group compared with controls ( extended data figure  1c ) . to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the glucose pulse paradigm induces memory in  - cells  we evaluated the expression of essential mediators of the insulin secretory response . 
 the glucose pulse paradigm induced expression of glucokinase ( gck )  the main glucose sensor of  - cells ( figure  3a )  the voltage - gated ca channel ( cav1.2 ) ( figure  3b )  snap25  an essential component of the exocytotic machinery ( figure  3c )  and mafa  a key transcription factor of the insulin gene and the mature  - cell phenotype in general ( figure  3d ) . 
 all the effects of the pulsed glucose paradigm on protein levels were reduced or abolished by treatment with kn93 during the high glucose exposure only . finally  we asked if metabolic memory of  - cells is dependent on glucose metabolism itself  or if this memory can be produced by membrane depolarization alone . to this end  we treated human islets with pulses of 30  mm kcl  which causes membrane depolarization  opening of voltage - gated ca channels  and insulin secretion without a prior increase in intracellular atp levels . 
 as shown in figure  3e  depolarization by potassium chloride during the acquisition period produced similar  if somewhat lower  increases in pcamkii and psynapsin levels 24  h  after the last kcl pulse . 
 thus  increases in intracellular calcium elicited by membrane depolarization are sufficient to activate camkii and produce metabolic memory . 
 total camkii protein levels were not affected by any of the treatments used ( data not shown ) . 
 glucose - stimulated insulin secretion is a complex process that translates glycolytic flux and elevated atp production to increased cytoplasmic ca levels and finally fusion of insulin granules with the plasma membrane . 
 this process is accompanied by increased phosphorylation of camkii ( extended data figure  2 )  a process now shown to be part of the establishment of metabolic memory in  - cells . 
 cerasi and colleagues had previously reported time - dependent potentiation of insulin secretion  in that exposure of rat islets to high glucose ( 27.7  mm ) up to 60  min prior to the test stimulation with glucose increased subsequent insulin secretion . 
 however  these studies focused on analyzing acute effects of high glucose pre - treatment  and did not yet investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the phenomenon . here  
 we demonstrate that human and mouse pancreatic  - cells are able to acquire  consolidate  and retrieve information  induced by high glucose exposure  and determined that this ability is dependent on camkii . in conclusion 
  we have shown here that  like neurons  human and mouse  - cells are able to acquire  store  and retrieve information in a process similar to neuronal ltp . 
 this process  presented schematically in figure  4  is dependent on the activation of camkii  as is the case for neuronal memory . 
 these findings provide further evidence that the similarity of neurons and  - cells on the transcriptome and epigenome level is not accidental  but an important aspect of the biology of these embryologically distinct cell types 
 . metabolic memory of  - cells likely represents a useful evolutionary adaptation to variation in food availability . as periods of food abundance in nature 
 can vary dramatically in length  metabolic memory of repeated carbohydrate loads in  - cells ensures higher insulin secretion and thus more efficient uptake of excess glucose into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue for long - term storage  contributing to the adaptation to periods of starvation . 
 given the pivotal role of altered insulin secretion in metabolic disorders  future work will need to establish to what extent metabolic memory of pancreatic  - cells contributes to the pathophysiology of these diseases .","

Abstract:
The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is involved in insulin secretion and neurotransmitter release. This study hypothesizes that pancreatic β-cells have metabolic memory, similar to neurons, by storing information from calcium pulses. A novel pulsed exposure to high glucose was used to test this hypothesis.

Research and Discussion:
The high-glucose pulse paradigm resulted in stronger insulin secretion in β-cells, dependent on CaMKII. This metabolic memory was reflected in protein levels and increased expression of key transcription factor, MAFA, involved in glucose sensing and vesicle secretion. Comparison to neurons suggests β-cells also have the ability to acquire and retrieve information.

Results and Conclusion:
Pulsed exposure to high glucose leads to stronger insulin secretion in β-cells through CaMKII, demonstrating metabolic memory. This is reflected in protein levels and increased expression of key transcription factor, MAFA. β-cells are able to acquire and retrieve information, similarly to neurons. "
"health is not only related to the absence of the disease  therefore we need to conceptualize and operationalize what health is . increasingly  we have come to understand that information about functional status is needed in order to appreciate the full picture regarding the health of an individual or a population . 
 an individual 's health fundamentally includes their capacity to carry out the full range of actions  activities and tasks required to fully engage in all areas of human life . 
 the health state of a person can be described in terms of capacity to carry out a set of tasks or actions . 
 in addition  the health state also includes changes in body functions and/or structures arising from a health condition . 
 the impact of the health state on a person 's life can be understood by measuring performance of tasks and actions in the person 's real - life or actual environment . 
 the full picture of the health experience can further be appreciated by taking into cognizance the value that people place on levels of functioning in given domains in association with a health condition . plainly  the concept of functional status is integral to health and its achievement . 
 two individuals with identical diagnoses may have utterly different levels of functioning that determine their actual health status . without fsi  
 our picture of the health of an individual  or a population  is flawed and incomplete . 
 fsi has  of course  long been collected in various ways and used clinically  especially in rehabilitative medicine ; physical  occupational and speech and language therapy ; and in nursing home and home care settings . 
 fsi is essential for needs assessment as well as the development and monitoring of rehabilitative interventions to restore or maintain functions . 
 it is also essential in this area of health care because the aim of therapy is to assist patients in maximizing their capacities to perform activities needed for their lives . 
 although no one doubts that restoring functioning is restoring health ( the ultimate purpose of all forms of health care ) some clinicians  focusing exclusively on acute - care needs  do not see the need to collect or utilize fsi . in most countries with a sophisticated health administrative data collection and utilization infrastructure  a wide variety of information 
 what is often missing is information that would link diagnosis and treatment with health outcomes that are fully meaningful to the patient 's life  namely information about the presence of decrements in capacity to carry out tasks and actions in areas of life as well as how these decrements play out in the person 's actual  real - life environment ( deyo and patrick  1989 ; lubetkin et al .  2003 ) . 
 there is growing recognition that there is a gap in health administrative records : the failure to collect or disseminate fsi across all health care settings . unless fsi becomes an essential part of administrative records  
 the potential value of these data will be lost  not merely to clinicians  but to health administrators concerned about management and quality of care issues  health researchers  and public health agencies . 
 this insight is clearly expressed in a report by the national committee on vital and health statistics ( ncvhs ) ( 2001 ) :  without functional status information  the researchers  policymakers  and others who are already using administrative data have at best a rough idea of how people  individually and collectively  are doing and at worst they are making erroneous assumptions and decisions . 
 the report outlines in some detail the benefits of routinely collecting fsi across the entire health care delivery system and throughout all care settings . 
 fsi can serve management needs of all the stakeholders in the health care system  clinicians  providers  payers  patients  and government regulatory bodies . this is true especially with respect to evaluating outcomes  comparing treatment modalities  and predicting and managing costs . 
 this links directly to debates of modes of service provision  single or multiple payer  managed care  fee - for - service  or some hybrid mixture . 
 the policy and research applications of fsi are evident for local health management and quality control  and in the broader arena of public health . 
 policy decisions about priorities must be made at the level of individual clinics or hospitals  local or regional health care agencies  or at the level of government planning and budgeting . given the importance of getting the complete picture of health outcomes  fsi is an essential input into evidence - based policy decisionmaking . 
 researchers in all areas of health and social policy  at all levels  need valid and reliable data about functional status in order to make informed decisions . 
 for example  it is a matter of debate whether  as the world 's population lives longer and ages  they will be unhealthy and pose a greater burden on health systems . there is some evidence suggesting that elderly persons today are functioning at higher levels than before . 
 without reliable information on levels of functioning  this debate would be unresolvable because it would not be possible to detect functional status  since the disease morbidity may not have changed very much . 
 compression of morbidity occurs when disability or decrement in functioning is postponed more than longevity is extended  as for example with the effects of exercise or better eating habits . 
 the direct test of compression ( or extension ) of morbidity depends on the effects of reduced health risks on cumulative lifetime disability ( fries  1980  2001 ; vita et al .  
  fsi is a crucial element for the description of health states and quantification of overall health status in individuals that can be aggregated to a summary measure of population health . at the who  the use of fsi is in this area  in particular  because this data ( collected by the world health survey now in the field in more than 70 countries ) feeds into ongoing endeavors to determine levels and distributions of health 
 this survey would be inconceivable without information on health outcomes that describe health on multiple dimensions in terms of levels of functioning in a parsimonious set of domains . 
 it is commonly known that the demographic trends toward an older population  at least in developed counties  will create unprecedented burdens on all age - sensitive social policies  such as social security and other pensions  retirement  unemployment  and long - term care . 
 aging  according to a recent organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) ( 2001 ) report  is the principal factor currently driving pension spending costs . since age - sensitive social programming constitutes between 40 and 60 percent of total public spending 
  the impact of aging is considerable . to comprehend the nature and magnitude of its social impact 
  those responsible for policies from transportation and housing to employment and taxation  will need reliable data on functional status and how it plays out in the lives of the aging population . for fsi to be available for this wide variety of uses  however  
 it must be routinely and consistently collected across the entire health care delivery system  preferably in some electronic format . 
 nonetheless  before contemplating the systemwide changes required to collect fsi  a classification that provides a common language and framework to describe the universe of functioning and disability is required . in order to complement the classification scheme  a comprehensive coding system that creates consistent and comparable data across all settings of care and a method of routinely capturing and disseminating these data ( in a mode and manner consistent with social interests in preserving privacy ) linked to measurement tools for clinical and related encounters 
 the foundation of a new structure for collecting fsi is  therefore  a standard classification and coding system that will make it feasible for fsi to be included in administrative data . as the ncvhs report stated :   while the international classification of diseases ( icd ) has served us well for more than a century in characterizing diagnoses  it is now time to complement it with a parallel system for characterizing functional status . 
 although the committee argued that more research  analysis  testing  and demonstration projects are required before final recommendations can be made  it concluded that :  the concepts and conceptual framework of the icf have promise as a code set for reporting functional status information in administrative records and computerized medical records . in the committee 's view  the icf is the only existing classification system that could be used to code functional status across the age span .  in this article  we want to briefly describe the extensive international developmental process that lead to the revision of the original international classification of impairments  disabilities and handicaps ( icidh ) ( world health organization  1980 ) and produced the icf . 
 we also want to describe the basic principles and structure of the icf  in particular  to show its value in the context of collecting fsi for administrative records . 
 the primary mandate of who is the production and dissemination of reliable and timely information about the health of populations . who 's 1947 constitution requires that :  each member shall provide statistical and epidemiological reports in a manner to be determined by the health assembly . 
 countries have long reported causes of death or mortality statistics based on who 's ( 1992 ) 
 international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems ( icd-10 ) . though useful for calculating life expectancy for different countries  however  who recognized that these data did not capture the overall health status of living populations . 
 missing was information about non - fatal health outcomes  i.e.  functioning and disability across all areas of life . to meet this need  who ( 1980 ) issued a tool for the classification of the consequences of disease  namely the icidh . 
 a considerable academic literature built up around clinical and other uses of the icidh  but much of this literature was critical of the underlying model of disability . 
 responding to these critiques and an international call for an updated version  who launched a revision process in 1993 to address what many viewed as an urgent international need for a framework for measuring and reporting the health as functional status at both individual and population levels . over the next 10 years  who 's international collaborating centers and governmental and non - governmental organizations  including groups representing persons with disabilities  engaged in the systematic revision of the icidh . from an exhaustive literature search of existing classifications and assessment tools  
 the who revision team developed a 3000-plus item pool of potential classification domain names for areas of human functioning at the body  person  and social levels . 
 all efforts were made to ensure that the icidh-2  as it was initially named  would be a suitable classification for all domains of functioning associated with both physical and mental health conditions . adopting the strategy of computer software development  alpha and beta drafts were prepared from 1996 forward . 
 the original 1980 icidh had only been approved for field - trial purposes . in light of that  the who team felt for icidh-2 to have the necessary credibility and legitimacy to serve as the international standard language of health and functioning  that the revision process should include several years of field trials and other tests . 
 the first phase of field trials concentrated on the cross - cultural and linguistic applicability of the model and classificatory structure and language of the icidh-2 . 
 the intent of this phase of field trials was to establish the conceptual and functional equivalence of the items contained within the classification . 
 stn et al.(1999a  b ; 2000 ) provide the rationale for the methodologies and presentation and analysis of the 15-country field trials . 
 these results fed into further international collaboration in which the who team relied on a global network of who collaborating centers  non - governmental organizations  disability groups  and individual experts and key informants . 
 the next revision phase began in 1999 when a series of expert drafting teams were assembled in geneva to produce the beta 2 draft . 
 this draft was used for the second round of international field trials  these focusing on questions of reliability  utility  and feasibility of use . 
 once the results of these tests were collected and analyzed  a pre - final draft was produced in early fall 2000 as a result of an intensive editing process grounded in the expert input being received from around the world . 
 the icidh-2  unlike its predecessor  was from the outset developed in multiple languages  primarily to identify and respond to cross - cultural and linguistic differences that might affect the usefulness of the classification . 
 the collaborating centers and others provided constant input at this stage as the language and classification structures were redrafted and refined in multiple iterations . 
 the draft was put on the internet for comment from a wide range of individuals  including both providers and consumers . after presentation before the executive board in december 2000  the classification was put on the agenda of the fifty - fourth world health assembly and renamed the icf . 
 the new title reflected the philosophy of moving beyond the consequence of disease approach and highlighted functioning as a component of health . in may 2001  
 it was unanimously endorsed  member states were urged   to use the icf in their research  surveillance and reporting as appropriate .  with its approval  the icf became a member of the who family of international classifications . whereas icd-10 provides the codes for mortality and morbidity  icf provides the codes to describe the complete range of functional states that capture the complete experience of health . 
 the icd-10 and icf are  therefore  complementary and who encourages users to utilize both together  wherever applicable . 
 this will ensure a more meaningful and complete picture of the health of people or populations . 
 soon after its official release  who 's director general  gro harlem bruntland  announced that the icf is who 's framework for measuring health and disability at both the individual and population levels . who has already implemented icf as the basis for its extensive world health survey program  demonstrating its use as a global and universal tool . 
 to improve health  tools are needed to measure health  and in particular to measure the changes in health brought about by interventions . 
 icf is the ruler with which we will take precise measurements of health and disability .  ( brundtland  2002 . ) from the public health perspective  the usefulness of icf goes beyond that of the measuring of population health and the effectiveness of internationally coordinated interventions funded by initiatives  such as the global fund to fight aids  tuberculosis and malaria . 
 in addition  with the icf as their framework  countries will be able to identify social factors such as education  transportation  or housing  both as determinants of health  and social factors influenced by improvements in health . 
 making these links will further support the relationship between health and economic development . in short 
  we have   in the shape of a little red book  an extraordinarily versatile tool  a swiss army knife for health ministries  researchers and decision - makers . 
 ( brundtland  2002 . ) undoubtedly the primary reason that icf can plausibly claim to be a universal tool for classifying states of functioning and disability is that the underlying model of the icf reflects our best understanding of the complex phenomena of functioning and disability in a manner that is  to the greatest extent possible  theory - neutral and therefore compatible with whichever theoretical account of how disability arises  at the individual and population levels  that evidence may confirm . 
 it is the conceptual basis for the definition  measurement  and policy formulations for all aspects of disability . 
 a paradigmatic shift in the thinking with regard to disability that is captured in the icf is the stress placed on health and levels of functioning . 
 heretofore  disability has been construed as an all or none phenomenon : a distinct category to which an individual either belonged or not . 
 the icf  on the other hand  presents disability as a continuum  relevant to the lives of all people to different degrees and at different times in their lives . 
 disability is not something that happens only to a minority of humanity  it is a common ( indeed natural ) feature of the human condition . 
 the icf is for all people  not just people traditionally referred to as disabled and isolated as a separate group . 
 icf thus mainstreams the experience of disability and recognizes it as a universal human experience . by shifting the focus from cause to the full range of lived experiences  it places all health conditions on an equal footing  allowing them to be compared using a common metric  the ruler of health and disability . from emphasizing people 's disabilities  and labeling people as disabled 
  we now focus on the level of health and functional capacity of all people . 
 decrements in functioning may be the result of decrements in intrinsic capacity or problems with body functions or structures ; or they can result from features of the person 's physical  human - built or social environment that lead to problems in performance over and above decrements in capacity . 
 very likely  decrements in functioning are the result of both processes . yet  the extent to which intrinsic decrements in capacity or environmental factors are the cause is not a matter that can be determined a priori . 
 moreover  icf is grounded in the principle of universality  namely that functioning and disability are applicable to all people  irrespective of health condition  and in particular that disability  or decrement in functioning at one or more levels  is not the mark of a specific minority class of people  but is a feature of the human condition  which is  epidemiologically speaking  over the lifespan  a universal phenomena . 
 in addition  icf is committed to the principle of parity  which states that the functional status is not determined by background etiology  and in particular by whether one has a physical rather than mental health condition . 
 much time  effort  and international collaboration has gone into the development of the icf . 
 it is no longer plausible to insist that the icf is a medical classification of people with disability  that it reduces all issues of functional status to underlying medical conditions  that it ignores the often salient role of the physical and social environment in the creation of restrictions of participation experienced by persons with functional problems . 
 the revision process has produced a classification that has already stood up to rigorous tests of validity  reliability  and cross - cultural applicability . 
 it is  as the ncvhs has concluded    the only existing classification system that could be used to code functional status across the age span . 
 we now turn to the structure of icf as a classification system  in part to show why the committee has correctly assessed the value of the icf as a coding system for functional status  suitable for use in administrative records . 
 the model that informs icf  portrays functioning and decrements in functioning  or disability  as a dynamic interaction between health conditions ( diseases  disorders  and injuries ) and contextual factors . 
 contextual factors include environmental factors  that is  all aspects of the physical  human - built  social  and attitudinal environment that create the lived experience of functioning and disability . 
 although not classified in icf  contextual factors also include personal factors such as sex  age  coping styles  social background  education  and overall behavior patterns that may influence how disability is experienced by the individual . 
 the terms functioning and disability in the icf are the general or umbrella terms for  respectively  the positive and negatives aspects of the interaction between an individual ( with a health condition ) and that individual 's contextual factors ( environmental and personal factors ) . in the icf  health condition is the umbrella term for disease ( acute or chronic )  disorder  injury or trauma 
 . a health condition may also include other circumstances such as pregnancy  aging  stress  congenital anomaly  or genetic predisposition . 
 the icf interactive model identifies three levels of human functioning : functioning at the level of body or body part  the whole person  and the whole person in their complete environment . 
 these levels in turn define three aspects of functioning : body functions and structures  activities  and participation . 
 disability similarly denotes a decrement in functioning at one or more of these levels  that is  an impairment  activity limitation or participation restrictions . 
 table 2 shows the complete list of all of the chapters found in the three classifications included in icf . under each of these chapters 
 are second  third  and in some instances  fourth levels of categories  arranged in a hierarchical  tree - branch - stem - leaf  arrangement . 
 this structure makes it possible for icf to be used as a classification tool for systematically describing situations of human functioning and problems with functioning . 
 this complex information is organized by icf by means of a hierarchical coding system  thereby creating a common international language for functioning and disability . 
 icf organizes information by means of several classifications distributed into two parts : ( 1 ) a component of functioning and disability that includes the component of the body with the body function and body structure classifications  and the component of activities and participation that includes all domains denoting aspects of functioning from an individual and social perspective organized into a single classification  and ( 2 ) a component of contextual factors that has a list of environmental factors organized from the individual 's most immediate to the wider environment . 
 the classifications in the first part identify all of the domains of functioning  from basic physiological functions and body structures  to simple and complex actions  tasks  social performances and relationships . 
 the environmental factors list provides a tool for identifying those features of a person 's physical  human - built  social and attitudinal environment that  in interaction with the domains of functioning  constitute the complete lived experience of human functioning and disability . within the contextual factors part  besides the environmental factors  the icf recognizes the existence of personal factors as another component  but provides no classification of these . 
 domains are a practical  meaningful set of related physiological functions  anatomical structures  actions  tasks  or areas of life . 
 domains make up the different chapters and blocks within each component ( world health organization  2001 ) . in order for these domains to capture descriptive information about functioning and disability in particular cases  
 they must be used in conjunction with qualifiers that record the presence and severity of a problem or decrement in functioning at the body  person  and social levels . for the classifications of body function and structure  
 the primary qualifier indicates the presence of an impairment and  on a five - point scale  the degree of the impairment of function or structure ( no impairment  mild  moderate  severe  and complete ) . in the case of the activity and participation list of domains  
 two essential qualifiers are provided to capture the full range of relevant information about disability . 
 the performance qualifier is used to describe what an individual does in their current or actual environment  including whatever assistive devices or other accommodations the person may use to perform actions or tasks and whatever barriers and hindrances exist in the person 's actual environment . 
 because the current environment always incorporates the overall social context  performance might be understood as involvement in the lived experience of disability . 
 the capacity qualifier describes an individual 's inherent ability to execute a task or an action . 
 operationally  this qualifier identifies the highest probable level of functioning of a person in a given functional domain at a given moment without any specific assistance . for measurement purposes 
  this level of capacity presumes a standardized assessment environment  namely one that reveals the inherent capacity of a person in a specific functional domain without any particular enhancements . 
 the environmental factors list can be used to describe such a standard assessment environment in order to ensure that results across different studies can be compared by holding this environment constant . 
 intuitively  the performance qualifier captures what people actually do in their lives  whereas the capacity qualifier identifies the person 's inherent capacity without explicit environmental facilitation ( or hindrance ) . 
 who is developing a standard application guide that will operationalize the constructs of capacity and performance with respect to individual items that form the classification . 
 table 3 shows how data can be organized to reflect the role of these two qualifiers used for the domains of the activity and participation classification . as a general matter of describing functioning and disability phenomena fully and accurately  the performance / capacity 
 having access to both performance and capacity data enables icf users to determine the gap between capacity and performance . 
 if capacity is less than performance  then the person 's actual or current environment has enabled him or her to perform better than what data about their capacity would predict : the environment has facilitated performance . on the other hand  
 if capacity is greater than performance  then some aspect of the environment is acting as a barrier to a level of performance that is feasible in a more suitable environment . 
 icf thus makes it possible to measure the effect of a person 's environment on their decrement in functioning  given their health condition . 
 the environmental factors classification can be used to identify specific features of the person 's actual environment that are barriers or facilitators in general for the person or with specific regard to each item of the person 's body functions  body structures or activities and participation that have been described . 
 it can also be used  as previously stated  to describe specific testing environments where capacity has been measured . for its use as a classification of functional status relevant for health administrative records 
  icf provides a complete classification of both body and person level domains of functioning . 
 given that it has been designed for a multiplicity of uses and users  there is far more in icf than could ever be plausibly integrated into a viable coding system for health records  although it remains the ultimate lexicon to which any coder  for clinical or research purposes  could turn . 
 clearly  for implementation purposes in this area  a simplified checklist of items is needed . 
 such a checklist was produced and used during the beta 1 and 2 field - testing phase in the revision process ( world health organization  2001 ) . 
 this checklist  which takes less than 30 minutes to complete  is currently being extensively tested in clinical studies in different disorders in order to study its feasibility  reliability  and concurrent validity with existing assessment instruments as part of a larger project to define core sets of items that may be used in rehabilitation settings for specific conditions and across several disorders ( stucki et al .  2002 ) . 
 the core sets of items with their corresponding scales could also be then converted into even shorter assessment instruments . 
 the challenge for incorporating the icf into clinical and administrative records beyond a lexicon and framework lies in identifying this parsimonious set of domains or items that captures decrements in functioning across different health conditions and a smaller subset of domains or items that uniquely describe the decrements of functioning that typify a given health condition . 
 in addition  the mapping of instruments ( that measure functioning and disability that are already in use ) onto icf categories will allow a ready crosswalk between measurements already being made at points of encounter to a common framework ( cieza et al .  2002 ) . 
 the use of the icf in larger population based surveys will also provide data on norms and distributions of health  functioning and disability that will enable the setting of appropriate thresholds for a multitude of purposes . 
 table 4 maps the domains of the icf that have been included in different waves of the world health survey that ought to be included as a minimum or ideal set for information systems . 
 these domains are also included on the icf checklist  which is designed to be a clinical tool . 
 primary data collection strategies with regard to functional status  in a manner that is truly comparable  are in their infancy especially for international use and for use across population groups . 
 further tools need to be developed  and standards and procedures established  so that these data become meaningful and usable . as a final issue  it must be mentioned that the icf has been conceived as a dynamic classification that will not only serve multiple users requiring different levels of detail  but also will continue to evolve with advancements in science . 
 the classification is flexible in its structure such that it can be expanded in the level of detail ( for example  the fourth level ) for specific uses  or new codes added where gaps have been left in the numbering system . 
 a set of operational rules will specify the procedure for this evidence - based expansion  adaptation  or revision of the classification . 
 a common language for describing fsi is the key to ensuring comparability of data from a myriad of sources as well as in providing users with a tool for precise and accurate communication with each other . 
 the recognition that a description of health and health - related outcomes must go beyond a narrow view of health restricted to the absence of disease  as well as that the definition of disability must move beyond the narrow impairment - based view that has been traditionally adopted to define a minority population  will go a long way in bridging the gap between health and disability data . 
 it will also fill the void in existing health outcomes data while measuring the impact of interventions and monitoring them over time . 
 health records must include functioning information in order to ensure a complete description of health states . 
 the icf is the common language and framework that users will employ from now on . in the same way that all languages grow  
 evolve  and flourish over time and are adapted and modified to express new ideas  the icf will have a multitude of applications where it will be creatively used such that it continues to be a living classification . 
 as with all new languages  it will be important to develop tools to learn this new language . toward this end  
 who is developing standardized application manuals and web - based learning courses that will use state - of - the art pedagogic methodology to assist end users . 
 its usefulness in describing functional health status information will be one of the measures of its success .","

1) Abstract: The need for a common framework for describing functional status information in health records is essential to make this information meaningful and comparable. The World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health provides this framework.
2) Research and Discussion: The biopsychosocial model of functioning and disability embodied in the ICF offers a holistic perspective and allows for targeted intervention planning. Evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these interventions at the personal or societal level is then possible.
3) Results and Conclusion: The ICF framework allows for meaningful evaluation and comparison of functional status information and aids in developing effective programs at different levels. This has the potential to improve overall health outcomes and contribute to the success of healthcare systems."
"the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) and united states preventive services task force ( uspstf ) recommend universal hiv screening for all pregnant women entering prenatal care [ 1  2 ] . 
 this screening enables hiv - infected women and their infants to benefit from appropriate and timely interventions such as antiretroviral medications . 
 when the recommended antiretroviral and obstetric interventions are used  a woman who knows of her hiv infection early in pregnancy now has a less than 2% chance of delivering an hiv - infected infant . without intervention  this risk is approximately 25% in the united states [ 36 ] . 
 testing for hiv began in 1985 with the introduction of the enzyme immunoassay ( eia ) . in order to account for false positive results using screening tests in a low - prevalence population 
  confirmatory testing has been implemented using a western blot or immunofluorescence assay .   in a low - prevalence population  
 the false positive rate using the eia is increased compared to a high - prevalence population  and the positive predictive value of any test will always depend on the prevalence of the condition in the population tested .   in testing performed by the cdc  
 the eia positive predictive value ranges from 71 to 83% in populations with hiv prevalence from 0.5 to 1% . 
 some investigators believe that the presence of alloantibodies account for the increased false positive rate associated with pregnancy  transfusions  transplantation  and autoimmune diseases .   however  risk factors specific to pregnancy that account for this are poorly understood . 
 conversely  a recent large retrospective study found that the false positive hiv eia rate was lower in pregnant women compared to nonpregnant individuals ( 0.14% versus 0.21% ) . 
 our objective was to determine if any maternal characteristics correlated with false positive hiv eia testing at delivery . 
 this was a review of all women who delivered at parkland memorial hospital in dallas  tex  from october 1  2005 through september 30  2008 . 
 all women routinely received serum hiv testing at their initial prenatal visit and at time of presentation to labor and delivery for delivery via the opt - out approach with the abbott commander hiv ab hiv-1/hiv-2 ( rdna ) eia ( abbott laboratories  abbott park  ill ) . 
 hiv test results performed at the time of delivery were analyzed in this study . a woman was considered hiv negative if eia testing was negative . 
 positive test results were confirmed with the fluorognost immunofluorescent assay ( ifa ) hiv-1 ( sanochemia corp  stamford  conn  usa ) . 
 women were considered to be falsely positive if eia results were positive and the ifa was negative . 
 women delivered in this time period were identified through the obstetric operations database and linked to the pathology database for hiv  hepatitis b surface antigen ( hbsag )  and rapid plasma reagin ( rpr ) results . 
 maternal characteristics  including race  parity  age  singleton versus multiple gestation  and a diagnoses of diabetes or hypertension were obtained using the obstetrics operations database . 
 laboratory results drawn 28 days prior to delivery through seven days after delivery were included . 
 the study was approved by the institutional review board at the university of texas southwestern medical center . 
 categorical data were reported as frequencies  and statistical significance was determined using   analysis . 
 statistical analyses were performed using sas  version 9.2 ( sas institute  cary  nc ) . 
 a total of 47794 women were identified who delivered during the study time frame . 
 compared to hiv negative patients  false positive patients were more likely to be nulliparous ( 43% versus 31%  p < 0.001 ) and younger ( mean age 23.9  5.7 versus 26.2  5.9  p < 0.001 ) . 
 hiv positive patients were significantly older than false positive patients ( 27.4 versus 23.9  p < 0.001 ) and hiv negative patients ( 27.4 versus 26.2  p = 0.012 ) . 
 of the 47794 women  47391 ( 99% ) were hiv negative  145 ( 0.3% ) had a false positive test  172 ( 0.4% ) were true positives  and 86 ( 0.2% ) tested equivocal or were missing hiv results . 
 the specificity of the hiv eia test was 99.7% with a positive predictive value of 54.3% . 
 the sensitivity of the eia test was presumed to be near 100%  as the false negative rate using the eia has been previously demonstrated to be negligible in studies performed by the manufacturer . 
 table 2 shows the prevalence of diabetes  hypertension  hepatitis b  and results of syphilis testing in the study population . 
 hiv positive women were more likely to test positive for hepatitis b surface antigen ( 1% versus 0%  p = 0.002 ) and rpr ( 2% versus 0%  p = 0.02 ) . 
 there was no significant difference in the prevalence of diabetes or hypertension between the three groups . 
 there was also no significant difference in the rate of hbsag and rpr positivity between the hiv negative and false positive groups . 
 when evaluating the interaction between nulliparity and age  there is a significant correlation between the two variables ; that is  parous patients are likely to be older and  therefore  nulliparity and age are not independent predictors of hiv false positivity . 
 however  when the hiv testing groups ( positive  false positive  negative ) are stratified by parity  the comparison of age across the three groups remains significant only in nulliparous women ( table 3  p = 0.0003 ) . 
 the interaction between parity and age means that the difference in age between nulliparous and parous women is different depending on the hiv status . 
 for example  in the hiv positive group the nulliparous and parous women are closer in age than in the false positive group . 
 this was the first population - based study to evaluate risk factors for hiv false positivity in pregnant women presenting for delivery at a large urban institution . 
 we found that younger and nulliparous women were more likely to have false positive testing using the hiv eia . 
 the observed positive predictive value ( ppv ) of 54.3% was lower than the previously reported by the cdc ( ppv 7183% ) in a nonpregnant population  suggesting that pregnancy may be associated with a higher rate of false positivity . 
 the low positive predictive value of the hiv eia in our study may have been impacted by the relatively low hiv prevalence ( 0.4% ) in our population . 
 this information could be useful for counseling women who test positive for hiv at delivery and emphasizes the limitations of eia testing if used as a rapid test to determine the need for intrapartum and neonatal antiretroviral prophylaxis . 
 the false positive rates of currently available rapid hiv tests have been reported to be much lower than has been found with eia testing in this study . 
 evaluated the hiv false positive rate in over 900 pregnant women  most of whom were hispanic  using both the eia and a rapid point - of - care ( poct ) test  oraquick . 
 they found that while there were no false positive tests with the oraquick  there were seven false positives using the eia ( ppv 100% versus 35.7% ) . in the mother - infant rapid intervention at delivery ( miriad ) 
 study  jamieson et al . found that the ppv of the oraquick test was 90% while the ppv of the eia was 74% [ 12  13 ] . 
 current recommendations by the cdc and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists include rapid hiv screening for women presenting to labor and delivery with undocumented hiv status and for repeat hiv testing in the third trimester for women at high risk or who live in areas with high hiv prevalence [ 7  14  15 ] . 
 a woman testing preliminarily positive for hiv in labor should be counseled that she may have hiv infection and that her neonate may be exposed  and immediate antiretroviral prophylaxis should be recommended without waiting for confirmatory test results . 
 the results of our study may aid in counseling women if they test preliminarily positive for hiv using the eia  while awaiting confirmatory testing results . 
 it remains to be determined whether the same risk factors for false positive hiv eia testing apply to the poct tests used in a real life setting . 
 our study found that the positive predictive value of eia testing was only 54.3% and that younger nulliparous women were more likely to test falsely positive . 
 importantly  our data may represent the real world performance of the eia testing in a large obstetric population - based setting . 
 investigators also have noted a significant relationship between influenza vaccination and false positive screening for hiv antibodies [ 1618 ] . 
 a potential reason for this cross reactivity is that there are similarities in homology between the transmembrane domains of the influenza envelope protein hemagglutinin and the hiv-1 envelope proteins . in our population 
  there were no significant differences in age or parity and influenza vaccination acceptance rates ( unpublished data ) . 
 women in our study were from a single institution  with a predominantly hispanic background  and therefore the results may not be applicable to all populations 
 .   reasons for false positive hiv serology may vary depending on the geographical region .   while we did find a significant association between young age  nulliparity  and hiv false positive testing  
 our study does not have the capability to identify a causal relationship or explain why this association may exist . 
 in addition  our study can not address if these same risk factors for false positive testing apply to all other hiv tests . 
 further studies are needed to confirm our findings  elucidate the biological mechanisms for increased hiv eia false positivity in young  nulliparous women  and compare this conventional testing method with contemporary rapid screening assays  including poct .","

Abstract: A study was conducted to examine risk factors for false positive HIV enzyme immunoassay (EIA) testing at delivery. Results showed a 0.3% false positive rate, with nulliparity and younger maternal age being associated with false positive results.

Research and Discussion: The study included 47,794 pregnant women who delivered at Parkland Hospital between 2005 and 2008. EIA testing was routinely performed at delivery, with results confirmed through immunofluorescent testing. Statistical analyses revealed a 54.3% positive predictive value for EIA, with nulliparity and younger age being significant risk factors for false positive results.

Results and Conclusion: Among the study population, false positive HIV testing at delivery using EIA was associated with younger maternal age and nulliparity. These findings suggest the need for further research and interventions to address the high false positive rate in these subgroups."
"childhood obesity is a serious and growing public health problem that has arisen over the past three decades . 
 the increasing occurrence of disorders such as type 2 diabetes during childhood is believed to be a consequence of this obesity epidemic . 
 in addition to several behavioral and dietary risk factors  genetic predisposition is an important factor in the pathogenesis of childhood obesity . 
 it is estimated that 4070% of adiposity variance can be explained by direct or indirect genetic factors . 
 growth arrest - specific 6 ( gas6 )  cloned in 1988 and characterized in 1993  is a secreted vitamin k - dependent protein present in the human circulatory system [ 4  5 ] . 
 initially  gas6 was shown to be upregulated in growth - arrested fibroblasts  suggesting that it plays a protective role in certain cellular stresses such as during apoptosis . 
 gas6 expression is widespread in many tissues  including immune cells  endothelial cells  vascular smooth muscle cells  and adipocytes [ 79 ] . 
 the protein is also a ligand for the tam ( tyro-3/axl / mer ) family tyrosine kinase receptor . 
 the gas6/tam system has been implicated in cell survival and proliferation  cell adhesion and migration  hemostasis  and inflammatory cytokine release [ 4  10 ] . 
 recently  the gas6/tam pathway was found to be involved in mediating adipocyte survival and proliferation in vitro [ 11  12 ] . 
 experiments with mice fed a high - fat diet indicated that overexpression of gas6 might enhance body - fat accumulation  but blocking gas6 signaling using an axl antagonist could reduce body - fat mass and body weight 
 . interestingly  transgenic animals that ectopically express the axl tyrosine kinase receptor also develop progressive obesity with elevated circulating proinflammatory cytokines and severe systemic insulin resistance . 
 this protein - array study also revealed higher levels of axl mrna in subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese humans than their lean control counterparts had . 
 this indicates that the axl receptor may be involved in the development of human obesity . 
 in addition  some studies in transgenic mice indicate that gas6/axl signaling might recruit macrophages and other immune cells into the adipose tissue resulting in the production and secretion of proinflammatory mediators . 
 this suggests that the gas6/axl signaling might play a role in the pathogenesis of obesity - associated systemic inflammation [ 8  16  17 ] . 
 recent studies have indicated that systemic inflammation  a hallmark of childhood and adult obesity  is a pivotal mechanism linking obesity to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [ 1821 ] . although gas6 gene polymorphisms are reported to be associated with stroke  acute coronary syndrome  and type 2 diabetes [ 2224 ]  to our knowledge  both gas6 and axl gene polymorphisms associated with childhood obesity have not yet been identified . in order to address this issue 
  we conducted a community - based study to determine whether common variations in the gas6 and axl genes correlate with adiposity  systemic inflammation  insulin resistance among adolescents . 
 the taipei children heart study - iii was an epidemiological survey that investigated obesity and cardiovascular disease risk factors among adolescents in taipei city during 2006 . the sampling method and results 
 briefly  the survey included junior high school students in taipei city to collect a representative distribution of demographic  lifestyle  and biochemical characteristics to measure their risk for cardiovascular disease . 
 those with autoimmune diseases  cancers  or active infection and those taking medications known to interfere with insulin or glucose metabolism were excluded . excluding any missing data  727 adolescents ( 358 boys and 369 girls ) 
 the institutional review board of the tri - service general hospital approved these studies and obtained informed consent from both parents and adolescents . 
 all the participants completed a structured questionnaire detailing their gender  age  puberty development  and lifestyle characteristics ( including cigarette smoking  alcohol consumption  and physical activity ) . based on their responses 
  the subjects were divided into young adolescents with history of smoking  those without  and those who currently smoke . 
 physical activity was divided into 5 levels based on amount of exercise per week : less than 1  h  13  h  35  h  57  h  and over 7  h. survey questions concerning puberty onset included the development of the penis / testis and pubic hair for boys and development of breasts and pubic hair for girls . 
 body weight was measured of barefoot students wearing light indoor clothing and was rounded to the nearest 0.1  kg . 
 waist circumference ( wc ) was measured at the midway point between the inferior margin of the last rib and the crest of the ilium in a horizontal plane and was recorded to the nearest 0.1  cm . 
 body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters . to reduce extraneous variation between subjects  we collected blood samples from the students after 12  h fasting and who had consumed their usual diet for the previous 3 days . 
 children who had recently attended a holiday or family celebration were contacted for a blood sample several weeks after the event . 
 plasma glucose concentrations were determined by the glucose oxidase method by using the beckman glucose analyzer ii ( beckman instruments  fullerton  ca ) . 
 the intra- and interassay coefficients of variation ( cvs ) for glucose were 0.6% and 1.5%  respectively . 
 plasma insulin was measured using a commercial immunoradiometric kit ( biosource europe  nivelles  belgium ) . 
 serum levels for high - sensitivity c - reactive protein ( hscrp ) were measured using the tina - quant ( latex ) high - sensitivity assay ( roche  mannheim  germany ) . 
 serum il-6 concentrations were determined using a human high - sensitivity enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) ( innotest  besancon  france ) . 
 serum tnf- was measured with the biotrak high - sensitivity human elisa kit from amersham biosciences ( buckinghamshire  uk ) . 
 insulin resistance was assessed using the homeostasis model assessment ( homa )  in which the homa of insulin resistance ( homa - ir ) = fasting insulin ( u / ml )  fasting glucose ( mmol / l)/22.5 . gas6 
 protein concentration was measured using a sandwich elisa and a polyclonal mouse anti - human gas6 antibody ( r&d systems  lille  france ) as a catcher and a biotinylated goat antiserum as a detector ( r&d systems )  using previously described methods . 
 the technique has been validated by food and drug administration guidelines in a previous study ( intra- and interassay cvs of 6.5% and 8.5%  resp . ; 
 mean recovery on 10 patients of 97% ; lower limit of quantification 0.26  ng / ml ) . 
 dna was isolated from buffy coats using the qiaamp dna blood kit and following the manufacturer 's instruction ( qiagen  valencia  ca  usa ) . 
 the qualities of isolated genomic dnas were quantified using agarose gel electrophoresis  and the quantities were determined using a spectrophotometer . 
 snps rs8191973 and rs8191974 in gas6  as well as rs4802113 and rs2304232 in axl  were genotyped using a taqman assay with allele - specific probes on the abi prism 7900ht sequence detection system ( applied biosystems  foster city  ca  usa ) according to the standardized laboratory protocols . 
 descriptive results of continuous variables were expressed as means  sd . prior to statistical analysis  the normal distribution and homogeneity of the variables 
 were evaluated using the levene test for quality of variance  and the variables were then given a base logarithmic transformation if necessary . 
 the parameters homa - ir  triglycerides  hscrp  il-6  and tnf- were analyzed and tested for significance using a log scale . 
 the studied adolescents were categorized into subgroups based on their gas6 rs8191973 genotype ( cc  cg  and gg )  gas6 rs8191974 genotype ( gg  ga  and aa )  axl rs4802113 genotype ( cc  ct  and tt )  and axl rs2304232 ( aa  ag  and gg ) with gender specification . the differences between anthropometric and biochemistry data across genotypes were analyzed using a general linear model after adjusting for age  tanner stages  smoking status  drinking status  and physical activity . 
 chi - square tests were used to determine the genotype distributions for the hardy - weinberg equilibrium and to compare the proportions of abnormal anthropometric and biochemistry variables across genotypes . 
 we tested different genetic inheritance models  and a recessive model was applied in the final analyses for gas6 and axl . to determine whether the gas6 and axl snps are predictors of obesity and obesity - associated complications  
 logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio ( or ) and 95% confidence interval ( ci ) for each genotype and combined genotypes 
 . a two - sided p - value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant . 
 all statistical analyses were performed using pasw statistics 18.0 software ( spss inc .  chicago  il  usa ) . 
 in total  727 adolescents ( 358 boys and 369 girls ) were included in this study . 
 the mean age of all adolescents in this study was 13.3 years ( range  1215 ) and was similar between boys and girls . 
 in general  boys had higher bmi ( 22.3  4.0 versus 21.2  3.3  kg / m )  wc ( 80.0  10.1 versus 75.1  8.1  cm )  hscrp ( 0.9  1.3 versus 0.6  0.9 
 mg / l )  and glucose levels ( 93.8  6.3 versus 91.5  6.5  mg / dl ) than the girls ( all p < 0.001 ) . 
 however  girls had higher tanner stages ( 3.2  0.5 versus 3.0  0.4 ) than the boys ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 there was no statistically significant difference in the ages  tnf-  il-6  and insulin levels  and homa - ir between the boys and girls . 
 the allele frequency for the least frequent allele in boys was 12.6  22.1  41.9  and 29.7%  and 13.4  19.6  32.7  and 33.5% in girls for the gas6 rs8191973  gas6 rs8191974  axl rs4802113  and axl rs2304232 polymorphisms  respectively . 
 there was no significant difference in allele or genotype distribution between boys and girls at the 4 polymorphisms . 
 no statistically significant association between anthropometric characteristics  biochemistry data  and the gas6 rs8191973 genotypes was observed in the boys and girls ( table 1 ) . 
 however  there were significantly different hscrp levels between gg  ga  and aa genotypes of gas6 rs8191974 in boys  regardless of their age  tanner stages  smoking status  drinking status  or physical activity ( table 2 ) . 
 moreover  boys with the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191974 had significantly higher bmi  wc  and hscrp levels than those carrying the a allele . 
 the gas6 rs819174 genotypes were not significantly associated with any anthropometric characteristics and biochemistry in girls . 
 the p - values of all comparisons between anthropometric and biochemistry data across gas6 genotypes were presented in supplemental tables 1 and 2 available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/674069 . 
 in addition  the association between circulating gas6 protein levels and gas6 polymorphisms was investigated . 
 we found that the gas6 rs8191973 or rs8191974 genotypes were not significantly associated with circulating gas6 protein levels in both the sexes . 
 there were significantly different hscrp levels between tt  tc  and cc genotypes of axl rs4802113 in boys  independent of their age  tanner stages  smoking status  drinking status  or physical activity ( table 3 ) . 
 in addition  boys with the gg genotype of axl rs2304232 had significantly higher il-6 and insulin levels and increased homa - ir than those carrying the a allele ( table 4 ) . 
 however  in girls  axl rs4802113 or rs2304232 polymorphisms were not significantly associated with any anthropometric characteristics or biochemistry ( tables 3 and 4 ) . 
 the p - values of all comparisons between anthropometric and biochemistry data across axl genotypes were presented in supplemental tables 3 and 4 . 
 boys with the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191973 were 1.87-fold more likely to have higher hscrp levels than the c allele carriers . even after adjusting for age  tanner stage  smoking status  drinking status  and physical activity  
 a significant relationship between the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191973 and higher hscrp levels was still observed in boys ( table 5 ) . 
 moreover  boys with the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191974 exhibited a 1.40-fold greater risk for developing high bmi  a 1.58-fold greater risk for developing high wc  and a 2.68-fold greater risk to have higher il-6 levels than the a allele carriers . even after adjusting for all possible confounding factors including age  tanner stage  smoking / drinking status  and physical activity  the relationship between the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191974  higher bmi / wc  and higher il-6 levels still remained significant in boys . 
 however  the axl rs4802113 or rs2304232 polymorphisms showed no significant association with abnormal adiposity  inflammatory markers  and homa - ir in boys or girls ( see supplemental table 5 ) . 
 logistic regression analyses were applied to evaluate whether the combination of the gas6 rs8191974 and rs8191973 polymorphisms is a stronger risk factor for high adiposity  inflammatory markers levels  and homa - ir than when alone . 
 the combined effects of the 2 gas6 gene polymorphisms in the risk of high bmi  wc  il-6  and hscrp levels are shown in figure 1 . 
 after adjusting for the relevant confounding factors  we still observed that boys with the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191973 and the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191974 exhibited a 47-fold higher risk of high bmi  wc  il-6  and hscrp levels than the individuals with both the c allele of the gas6 rs8191973 and the a allele of the gas6 rs8191974 did ( or = 4.92  95% ci : 1.0823.6  p = 0.018 ; or = 4.18  95% ci : 1.0522.5  p = 0.016 ; or = 4.08  95% ci : 1.0628.56  p = 0.015 ; or = 7.22  95% ci : 1.4635.72  p = 0.010  resp . ) . 
 however  for girls  there was no statistically significant association between the combination of the gas6 rs8191974 and rs8191973 polymorphisms and abnormal variables . 
 in addition  we evaluated the combined effect of the gas6 rs8191973 or rs8191974 marker with axl gene polymorphisms and its association with risk of high adiposity  inflammatory marker  and homa - ir . 
 however  combinations of gas6 markers with axl gene polymorphisms were not found to be significantly associated with any abnormal variables in both boys and girls ( data not shown ) . 
 in this study  a strong association between gas6 and axl polymorphisms with body adiposity  systemic inflammation  and insulin resistance was identified among boys . 
 the risk of possessing high adiposity and inflammatory markers levels was higher in boys carrying the gg genotype with gas6 rs8191973 or rs8191974 than the noncarriers . 
 moreover  the combination of both gas6 polymorphisms had an additive effect on the development of obesity and obesity - associated inflammation in boys . 
 these data strongly suggest that gas6 and axl genes play a role in the pathogenesis of childhood obesity and its associated complications . 
 gas6 was originally identified as a gene that is expressed in fibroblasts and increases with serum starvation and contact inhibition ; gas6 is also a potential growth factor for fibroblasts . 
 maquoi and colleagues demonstrated that when fed with a high - fat diet  gas6-deficient mice had significantly less fat than their wild - type counterparts . 
 the authors also reported the expression of gas6 and its 3 receptors ( tyro-3  axl  mer ) in murine adipose tissues  thus suggesting that gas6 may act in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner to promote murine adipose tissue development . 
 previous experiments in transgenic mice demonstrate that gas6 might also induce obesity - associated inflammation via recruiting immune cells into the adipose tissue to producing and secreting proinflammatory cytokines [ 8  16  17 ] . 
 our recent clinical study found that circulating gas6 protein levels are associated with adiposity and inflammatory markers in overweight / obese adolescents . in this study  gas6 is further implicated as a candidate susceptibility gene for obesity and systemic inflammation . 
 however  the association between gas6 genotypes and circulating gas6 protein levels was not observed among adolescents . 
 we hypothesize that gas6 polymorphisms could affect the biology of the gas6 protein itself rather than its transcription or process rate  thus influencing adiposity regulation and systemic inflammation . to validate this  
 recent studies demonstrated that gas6/tam signaling is involved in releasing inflammatory cytokines ( such as il-6 and hscrp ) in diverse human diseases [ 23  31  32 ] . 
 in addition  the gas6/tam signaling is also known to be involved in several inflammation - related systems  including maturation of immune cells  endothelial activation  and immunoregulation . 
 our present study found that the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191973 and the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191974 are strongly associated with higher circulating il-6 and hscrp levels in boys . 
 therefore  the gas6 polymorphisms presumably influence gas6/tam signaling and could further activate inflammatory reactions and result in releasing circulating il-6 and hscrp . 
 however  the comprehensive effects of the gas6 polymorphisms in regulation of inflammatory cytokines still remain to be determined by more researches . 
 interestingly  a previous study found that the a allele or the aa genotype of gas6 rs8191974 is associated with decreased risk of stroke . 
 moreover  the a allele and the aa genotype are also thought to be related to a lower risk of developing acute coronary syndrome or type 2 diabetes  suggesting that this genotype exhibits protective activities against developing acute coronary syndrome and type 2 diabetes [ 23  24 ] . 
 we also observed similar results in those with the a allele or aa genotype of gas6 rs8191974 . 
 these subjects exhibited a lower risk for developing obesity and systemic inflammation than those with the gg genotypes . 
 together  these findings suggest that the gas6 rs8191974 polymorphisms play an important role in the development of obesity and obesity - associated complications ( e.g.  type 2 diabetes  cerebrovascular  and cardiovascular diseases ) . 
 the protective role of the aa genotype of gas6 rs8191974 against the developing childhood obesity and obesity - associated complications requires further study . 
 the axl protein is a membrane - bound receptor that belongs to the tam family of receptor tyrosine kinases . 
 axl exhibits the highest affinity for gas6 as compared to the other members of the tam family  whereas protein s predominantly binds mer and tyro-3 . 
 gas6/axl signaling has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of obesity and systemic inflammation [ 1315 ] . 
 however  our study demonstrates that axl polymorphisms are associated with systemic inflammation rather than childhood obesity . 
 moreover  the combination of gas6 and axl gene polymorphisms is not significantly associated with any variables in adiposity among adolescents . 
 our findings indicated that axl gene polymorphisms might not play a significant role in childhood obesity . recently  
 scroyen and colleagues   have published similar findings indicating that deficiency in a single axl receptor did not significantly affect adipogenesis or adipose tissue development in mice . 
 this is because an axl deficiency can be partially compensated by other tam family members ( tyro-3 and mer ) via gas6 interaction . 
 further studies are needed to investigate the effect of tyro-3 and mer receptors on the development of childhood obesity . 
 in addition  our present study also indicates that gender disparity exists regarding the effects of the gas6 polymorphisms on anthropometric characteristics and inflammatory markers . 
 we found no significant difference in genotype frequencies between boys and girls ; however  the effects of the gas6 polymorphisms  individually or combined  only manifest in boys . 
 the gas6 gene contains an estrogen response element in its promoter and is upregulated by estrogen via an activated estrogen receptor in mammary epithelial cells . 
 therefore  we hypothesized that the gender - specific effect of the gas6 polymorphisms on childhood obesity might be due to a disparity in sex hormone distributions . 
 this has been previously reported to be associated with gas6 expression and body composition [ 40  41 ] . despite these results  our study does have certain limitations . 
 first  this was a cross - sectional study  as such we might not be able to assess gas6 polymorphisms on weight dynamics and the development of obesity - associated complications throughout life . 
 second  because of the limitations of our questionnaire  we were not able to comprehensively estimate every adolescent 's daily intake . 
 the impact of dietary energy intake on genetic susceptibility also requires further investigation to better understand any confounding effect . 
 in conclusion  we indicate an association between the gas6 and axl polymorphisms with adiposity  circulating inflammatory markers  and insulin resistance of adolescents  especially in boys . 
 moreover  the gg genotype of gas6 rs8191973 or rs8191974 strongly correlates with susceptibility to develop obesity and systemic inflammation in boys . 
 nonetheless  these results together with those from studies in cellular and animal models encourage the study of the gas6/tam system in childhood obesity and its potential complications and further support the hypothesis that modulation of gas6 activity may indeed provide an important intervention point for future therapies .","

Abstract:
This study investigated the effects of gas6 and axl gene polymorphisms on adiposity, systemic inflammation, and insulin resistance in adolescents. Samples from the Taipei Children Heart Study - III were collected, and polymorphisms were genotyped. Results showed significant associations between gene polymorphisms and adiposity, inflammation, and insulin resistance in boys.

Research and Discussion:
After collecting samples and genotyping gene polymorphisms, this study found that boys with certain genotypes of gas6 and axl genes had higher levels of body mass index, waist circumference, and inflammatory markers. Additionally, insulin levels and insulin resistance were also elevated in boys with certain genotypes. These findings suggest the important role of gas6 and axl genes in adolescent health.

Results and Conclusion:
The results of this study indicate that gas6 and axl gene polymorphisms are associated with adiposity, systemic inflammation, and insulin resistance in adolescents. Particularly, boys carrying certain genotypes of these genes exhibited higher levels of adiposity and inflammatory markers. Further research is necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying these associations and their implications for adolescent health."
"infertility is one of the crucial and critical events in sex life which engages 1015% of couples all over the world  and as one of the most distressful life experiences  exposes couples to social and psychological problems . 
 couples  who are faced with this critical situation  are prone to depression  anxiety  loss of self - esteem and dissatisfaction with their sex life more than others . 
 however  the intensity of psychological problems resulting from cultural - social circumstances varies in different societies  to the point that the frequency of anxiety in infertile couples has been reported in a wide range from 48% to 96% . although  the advances in assisted reproductive techniques have opened new doors for infertile couples  but studies have shown that these treatments are accompanied with stress  anxiety and depression . but the intensity of these disorders could be defined by the cause of the infertility . evaluating the related factors of depression and anxiety among iranian infertile couples showed that women who were infertile themselves showed higher levels of anxiety and depression than women with male factor infertility . however  in societies that define women as the main source of fertility  starting assisted reproductive treatments with limited successful outcomes could be harmful to these women 's mental health . 
 utilization of assisted reproductive techniques requires processes such as daily injection to stimulate ovulation  vaginal ultrasound and painful processes such as oocyte aspiration which are all too expensive and alongside with the fear of failure could become a harmful condition . 
 although  fertile women  who start assisted reproductive treatments due to their husband 's infertility have natural biological conditions to get pregnant  but they have to tolerate these critical processes due to male factor infertility . also  women are under more cultural and social pressures 
 . these conditions could affect the vulnerability of fertile women during assisted reproductive treatment ; therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of assisted reproductive treatments on fertile women 's mental health . 
 thus  the prospective study conducted on 70 fertile women who referred to receive assisted reproduction treatments ( in vitro fertilization / intracytoplasmic sperm injection ) due to male infertility . 
 subjects had referred to the fertility and infertility center of esfahan from september 2013 to march 2014 . 
 the number of samples was calculated based on 80% test power and 95% confidence level . 
 inclusion criteria were primary infertility  not having any corporal and mental illnesses  not being a drug addict according to individual 's report  not having a history of mental illnesses  and not experiencing severe distress over 1-month prior to the treatment based on holmes - rahe scale . 
 exclusion criteria included experiencing distressful conditions during the study  discontinuation of the treatment and the cancellation of egg harvesting . 
 the study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the isfahan university of medical sciences . 
 mental health evaluation tool was the valid 28-questioned general health questionnaire that measures mental health on likert scale ( 03 ) in hypochondriasis  anxiety  social impairment  and depression dimensions . in this method gaining the score of 5 in each subscale and 23 in all dimensions together was defined as having a mental disorder . 
 sampling was conducted through simple sampling ; that is  all persons  who referred to fertility and infertility center of esfahan for treatment and to start the process protocol due to male factor infertility were interviewed . then by referring to their medical records and conducting holmes - rahe scale  
 their eligibility for the study was assessed . after being considered eligible for entering the study  
 their demographical features including age  educational level of couples  economic condition  and the duration of their infertility were recorded . 
 ovulation was stimulated through the long protocol in all the participants . during the treatment period  
 ovarian reaction conditions and number of injections employed for ovarian stimulation were followed - up . 
 3 h after the pickup process  and under appropriate circumstances  the questionnaire for general health was completed again . if the circumstances were inappropriate filling of the questionnaire 
 was delayed for 2 h. research data were analyzed using spss software version 16 [ spss inc . 
 : chicago  il  usa ]  statistical paired t - tests and multi - variable linear regression tests . 
 seven qualified subjects quit the study because of the unwillingness to continue ( three persons ) and ovarian hyper stimulation ( four persons ) . 
 demographic and clinical data results showed no significant difference in the mean score of different dimension of mental health before ovulation induction and after oocyte harvesting [ table 2 ] . also  the rate of psychological disorder in the anxiety dimension showed no significant different before the induction ( 71.4% ) and after the pickup ( 66.7% ) ( p = 0.19 ) . 
 but the level of depression after pickup ( 31.7% ) was significantly lower than before the induction ( 39.7% ) ( p = 0.007 ) . 
 comparison of mental health dimensions b and a results showed no significant difference in the dimension of hypochondriasis before the induction ( 61.9% ) and after the harvesting ( 66.7% ) ( p = 0.07 ) . also  the level of social impairment showed no significant difference before the induction ( 84.1% ) and after the pickup ( 87.3% ) ( p = 0.08 ) . 
 the results of multi - variable linear regression to evaluate the relation between underlying variables and mental health condition before starting the process with the level of depression and anxiety after the harvesting are shown in table 3 . 
 the relation between mental health dimensions and background variables after ovulation stimulation the level of depression after egg harvesting was related to physical condition  depression and social impairment  independent from underlying variables . 
 also  the level of depression after egg harvesting was related to the economic condition  it also showed a significant relation with social impairment and hypochondriasis [ table 3 ] . 
 the present study aimed to assess the level of mental health in fertile women undergoing assisted reproductive treatments as a result of male factor infertility  at the beginning of ovulation stimulation process  and the effect of this process on their mental health . 
 results showed that these women do not start assisted reproduction treatment under appropriate mental health conditions . 
 but the level of depression and anxiety disorders at the beginning of ovulation stimulation was higher in the present research than other reports . 
 this would indicate that the process of treatment in fertile women is also a critical one and might affect their mental health . in a pursuit  to achieve a conceptual model for the effect of ovulation induction on women 's health  its negative effects on women 's functioning and health have been shown . 
 a qualitative study showed that iranian infertile couples show emotional reactions such as fear  concern  anxiety and depression as a result of fear of the failure of treatment during fertility treatment . 
 however  these mental disorders may be harmful even for women with appropriate fertility potentials . 
 also being angry with their husbands due to their infertility could be another explanation for women 's mental reactions . 
 positive correlation between the level of depression and anxiety and other dimensions of experiences during infertility treatment might be accompanied with social impairment  thus affecting the levels of depression and anxiety . 
 efforts to conceal infertility and efforts to get treatment as a result of concerns about being labeled as  infertile   are common among iranian couples . 
 this  by itself  could increase the level of anxiety among women when treatment starts . 
 another reason for the high level of depression and anxiety among women at the beginning of the ovulation stimulation might be the negative impact of gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( gnrh ) agonists on the mental health . although  this research did not evaluate mental health before and after the beginning of gnrh agonists  but this might explain women 's psychological disorders before ovulation stimulation regarding high frequency of mental disorders at the time of ovulation stimulation . with regards to the negative impact of anxiety and depression during the treatment on the result of assisted reproduction treatment  
 it is necessary that this group of women would be examined before the treatment process  since they are exposed to risks of mental health disorders  and be treated in case of high levels of depression and anxiety . 
 following the assessment of the main hypothesis of the research  that is the effect of ovulation stimulation on women 's mental health  study results showed that ovulation stimulation does not affect mental health ; the level of depression and anxiety  and the measure of psychological disorders in these two - dimensions did not show a significant difference before the ovulation and after the harvesting process . on the contrary 
  the depression level was decreased after the harvesting process . the negative impact of distress of infertility treatment on the level of depression has already been reported . 
 the cessation of treatment distress with the conclusion of ovulation stimulation and harvesting processes might be a reason for the decrease of depression level in subjects under study . 
 furthermore  results showed that fertile women 's level of depression and anxiety does not depend on the reaction of the ovary to the ovulation stimulation  and as these women have no problem in ovarian response to ovulation stimulation  their mental health depends more on other factors . in addition  all subjects  who sustained the research were those who reached the stage of the harvesting process ; the potential for ovum production was proven for these women . 
 this would enhance the self - esteem of subjects and decrease their concern over ovarian nonresponsiveness . 
 but direct correlation between the level of anxiety and depression in the stage after harvesting process with social impairment and hypochondriasis indicates that in this stage also the awareness of social dysfunction  independent from financial status  will have its own effect on mental health . 
 factors other than ovulation stimulation process which might influence the individuals levels of depression and anxiety have not been assessed in the present research . 
 depression and anxiety might result from a variety of factors  which require more extensive research . 
 another result of this research was that financial status  independent from the quantity of follicle obtained from ovulation stimulation  showed a reverse correlation with anxiety level after harvesting process . in ozken 's research  also financial status was a factor determining the anxiety in infertile couples . regarding financial pressures resulting from high costs of assisted reproduction treatments  which lead to the success of only 35% for each cycle  women 's concerns over the success of results in fertilization as an outcome of infertility of the partner detected after harvesting process while insemination in laboratory are not far from expectation . 
 nevertheless  although women are healthy in terms of fertility in couples undergoing male factor infertility treatment  effort to have babies not by normal methods and facing difficult  costly treatment protocols might threaten their evaluation of their feminine role  thus reducing their self - esteem . 
 another finding of this research was the existence of correlation between depression level after treatment process and anxiety level at the first stage  while this correlation was observed between depression level after treatment process and anxiety level at the second stage . 
 this finding indicates that women  who enter the process of treatment with a higher anxiety level are prone to a higher level of depression ; therefore necessary measures should be taken to prevent it . 
 one of this study 's limitations was that mental health assessment was conducted after starting the primary stages of the treatment therefore  the stress of this stage could affect the mental health during the whole process . 
 this study showed that fertile women who undergo assisted reproduction treatments do not start the treatment process in an appropriate mental health condition  and this condition would continue during the whole process until egg harvesting . 
 therefore  it is suggested that before starting the treatment the mental health of these women should be evaluated using screening tools and counseling sessions would be applied for vulnerable women .

1) Abstract: This study examines the mental health of fertile women undergoing assisted reproductive treatment for male factor infertility. Data was collected using a general health questionnaire before and after oocyte harvesting. Results show a decrease in mental health disorder rates after oocyte harvesting.

2) Research and Discussion: The study found that the process of assisted reproductive treatment did not significantly affect the mental health of fertile women, but they do often begin the process with high levels of depression and anxiety. Consultation for mental health should be considered before beginning the treatment.

3) Results and Conclusion: The results showed a significant decrease in mental health disorder rates after oocyte harvesting. However, anxiety levels after oocyte harvesting were positively correlated with economic situation. Prior to assisted reproductive treatment, consultation for mental health is crucial."
"balance impairment is an important fall - risk factor  and increases in range of postural sway in the mediolateral direction in older adults are associated with increased fall - risk and rates . 
 postural sway has been shown in older adults to be strongly related to other measures of balance . 
 multivariate analysis reveals serum vitamin d levels as an independent variable associated with postural sway . in individuals with suboptimal levels of vitamin d  
 epidemiological studies have shown that vitamin d levels show seasonal variation [ 7  8 ] . 
 lowest levels of serum vitamin d are recorded towards the end of winter  approximately four weeks after the shortest day of the year . 
 overall  vitamin d supplementation did not reduce rate of falls ( rar 1.00  95% ci 0.90 to 1.11 ; seven trials ; 9324 participants ) or risk of falling ( rr 0.96  95% ci 0.89 to 1.03 ; 13 trials ; 26  747 participants ) but may do so in people with lower vitamin d levels before treatment . 
 older adults are at risk for lower levels of serum vitamin d because of age - related changes in uvb absorption and skin capacity to synthesize vitamin d  reduction in activation in the kidneys  and reduced expression of vitamin d receptors in tissues . 
 there are many factors affecting fall - risk for older individuals  and although these may be different for inside and outside falls  strength and balance remain two important physical fall - risk factors . 
 a recently published overview of the literature supports an assertion that age - related changes in postural reactions may be related to vitamin d status - mediated through either central nervous system integration or antigravity muscles as the effectors in postural responses . despite changes in vitamin d across the seasons  muscle strength in the quadriceps muscles has been shown to remain stable . 
 the relationship of postural sway to any potential increased winter fall rate and decreased levels of vitamin d has not been investigated . 
 the winter season sees an increase in injuries from falls and in the number of accidental deaths from falls . 
 fracture rates from falls in older adults also increase at the end of the winter season  following two to eight weeks after the nadir in serum vitamin d levels . 
 some studies report an increased rate of falls  for both inside and outside falls [ 13  14 ] ; however  significant seasonal variation in fall rates was not found in a three - year study   while  in a second study  seasonal variation in fall rates was reported in women but not in men . 
 coincident static balance changes with any potential increased fall rates in winter have not been previously reported . 
 the data presented here forms part of a larger study  from which two other papers with the same clinical trial registration have been published [ 12  16 ] . the aim of this study was to determine differences in static balance ( postural sway )  vitamin d  incidence of falls  and type of fall serially at the end of each season over a 12-month period  in older community - living adults . 
 we hypothesised that postural sway  falls  and vitamin d would show a seasonal variation and that there would be an inverse relationship between vitamin d and the other variables . 
 at the end of consecutive seasons  static balance  vitamin d status  and fall rate were measured within a longitudinal study design . 
 no intervention was implemented by study researchers  so that the study could identify natural variations that occur over the seasons . 
 data was collected over a three - week period in each season from end of spring 2009 to the end of spring 2010  with collection of data timed to coincide with expected peaks and troughs in serum vitamin d levels   in australia at latitude 41 degrees south ( tasmania ) . 
 after each assessment  participants were given an appointment for the next collection block in three months ' time . 
 independently living community - dwelling adults aged between sixty and eighty - five years were recruited through local print media and community clubs . 
 daily intake of oral supplementation of vitamin d of greater than 800 international units was also an exclusion criterion . 
 participants were also excluded if they had a history of neurological disease and were withdrawn if they suffered a medical condition while participating in the study that would impact on their ability to perform the physical tests . 
 liver and kidney disease both impact vitamin d metabolism  and any potential participants with either of these conditions were excluded . 
 a priori sample size calculation was based on a previous study reporting mediolateral sway range in a sample of community - dwelling older adults  and this indicated a minimum requirement of 81 completed participants ( minimum effect size 2.5  mm sway ; standard deviation ( sd ) 8  mm ; power 0.8  alpha 0.05 ) . 
 ninety - eight participants were recruited with the anticipation of a 15% drop - out rate . 
 this repeated measures cohort study was designed to be able to detect differences in postural sway . 
 this project received ethical approval from the human research ethics committee ( tasmania ) network ( h0010561 ) . 
 postural sway range in the medio - lateral sway direction was measured using a force platform ( amti accugait pjb 101  massachusetts  usa ) for thirty seconds under conditions of eyes open and closed  as well as with the additional challenge of using a 6.5  cm foam cushion ( eyes open and eyes closed ) ( airex elite balance pad ag  switzerland ) . 
 participants were asked to remain stationary with their arms by their sides and look straight ahead while standing on the force platform . 
 foot position ( bare feet ) was standardised with heels 4  cm apart using marked placement for the feet to ensure repeatability between testing occasions . 
 venous blood samples were collected and clotted  then centrifuged ( 1610 relative centrifugal force ) for 15 minutes . 
 serum concentration of 25-hydroxy vitamin d was measured by direct  competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay in a commercial accredited laboratory  using liaison method ( diasorin inc .  
 participants received an individually coded calendar for 12 months of the study on which to report any falls and associated details by date  including information regarding the location and cause of the fall . 
 information about the type of fall  any injuries that resulted  and if medical attention was sought was recorded . 
 this study utilised the who definition of a fall as  an event which results in a person coming to rest inadvertently on the ground or other lower level  . 
 annual cyclic trends were investigated by fitting a sine wave formula to data for postural sway and vitamin d  with the amplitude of the seasonal variation ( in percentage change ) and the annual mean values were estimated using repeated measures nonlinear regression  adjusted for age and gender . for secondary analysis 
 the three monthly data were interpolated linearly to estimate intermediate values to correspond with the observed fall incident data . 
 mixed - methods poisson regression was used to determine associations between falls  fall injuries  and postural balance and vitamin d. the association between postural balance and vitamin d and season was estimated using mixed - methods linear regression  adjusted for age  gender  and strength . for comparison  seasonal data for falls was grouped into autumn and winter and compared to spring and summer . 
 physical activity using the champs questionnaire and muscle strength using the physiological profile assessment tools were recorded  and this information has been published elsewhere   but forms an integral part of the meta - analysis of this paper . 
 data from eighty - eight participants ( 70% females ) are included in the final analysis . 
 five people did not attend appointments  and five people could not complete testing because of medical events . 
 the participants had a mean ( sd ) age of 69.2 ( 6.5 ) years and body mass index 27.4  ( 3.9 )  kg    m. all participants were living in their own homes independently  with only 10% being sole occupants . 
 common chronic controlled health conditions included cardiovascular disease ( 39% ) and arthritis ( 14% ) . 
 twenty - six percent of the participants reported the use of more than 4 medications . 
 all four balance measures had the highest sway scores ( poorest balance ) at the first end of spring measurement . 
 all other seasonal measures were significantly different from this first time point ( all p < 0.05 )  but no subsequent significant difference was seen after any other seasonal measures  indicating a lack of seasonal variation in this outcome ( p > 0.05 ) . 
 no associations between postural sway and vitamin d were observed ( all p > 0.05 ) . increased postural sway 
 was associated with fall injuries ( irr 1.59 ( ci 1.14 to 2.24 ) ( p = 0.007 ) but not fall rates ( irr 1.36 ( ci 0.95 to 1.97  p = 0.09 ) . 
 there was 15% variation in this variable over the year  with a peak at the end of summer and the lowest values at the end of winter . 
 seventy - five percent of fall diaries were posted on schedule while the remaining diaries were returned at the subsequent assessment appointment  resulting in a compliance of 100% . 
 thirty - three percent of the cohort ( 29 people ) fell at least once  with 10% of the whole group falling multiple times ( 8 people ) . over the duration of the study  
 48 falls were recorded : 14 of these occurred inside the house  and 34 occurred outside . 
 six falls were due to fainting or dizziness and forty due to trip - related events  with one categorised as being pushed over ( by a horse ) and one not able to be categorised . 
 twenty - eight falls resulted in injury  with only four requiring medical treatment ( including one fracture ) . 
 further details on season variation in location and type of fall are provided in table 2 . 
 there were significantly fewer falls during spring than any other season ( p = 0.01 )  with no other differences between the seasons recorded . 
 when falls data were combined from autumn and winter seasons and compared to the combined spring and summer seasons  there were more falls reported in the combined autumn and winter seasons ( 30 compared to 18 ) . 
 less injuries from falls were recorded in spring than any other season ( p = 0.02 )  with no other seasonal differences recorded . 
 this is the first cohort study to determine that no seasonal variation of postural sway occurs across 12 months in our population . 
 significant seasonal variation in serum vitamin d levels  with higher serum levels in summer  was recorded . 
 there was a significant relationship between postural sway and the number of injurious falls observed  with lower values for sway range ( i.e.  better stability ) associated with less fall injuries . 
 a significant learning effect was seen with all measures of mediolateral postural sway with time point one having larger ranges than all of the other time points ( all p > 0.05 ) . 
 further to this  there was no seasonal variation in postural sway under any of the four static balance test conditions measured ( eyes open and closed on a firm surface or foam surface ) . 
 postural sway range has been used to identify those people with balance impairment  and it may be useful in describing the fall - risk status of a particular individual . 
 our data indicates that postural sway does not appear to be subject to changes across the year within a participant . 
 it has been suggested that this measure is important in describing sensorimotor deficits or disability rather than functional abilities   and hence may not be subject to changes that may occur due to altered patterns of activity or sunlight exposure seen seasonally . 
 the stability of this measure in a cohort across a year provides important information for researchers planning interventions designed to impact postural sway and clinicians who are measuring the effectiveness of their interventions . 
 mediolateral sway range has been shown to be an independent fall - risk factor for indoor falls . in our study  
 a lower proportion of falls occurred indoors ( 29% ) compared to outdoors ( 71% )  and although this is similar to other studies where more healthy samples have been reported as having a greater proportion of falls being outdoor falls ( 74% ; )  it may be a reason why no association between sway range and fall incidence was seen . 
 a trend for this association was evident and a larger sample size may have found a significant relationship between these two variables  as this study was powered to determine mediolateral sway changes not fall rates . 
 an association between increased sway range and rate of injurious falls was recorded in our study  reinforcing the importance of this measure for those most at risk of injury . 
 overall there was no significant relationship found between postural sway and vitamin d. as increased postural sway is linked to low levels of vitamin d  it may be that the levels of vitamin d were sufficient for this parameter even at their lowest levels in participants in this study and did not influence postural sway . 
 if this threshold situation is true  it may be that seasonal variation in postural sway may be present in a population with much lower levels of vitamin d  but this is outside the scope of the current study . 
 annual rates of falling for adults over 65 have been reported up to 40%  and although our cohort includes some adults between the ages of sixty and sixty - five  with a mean age of 69 years and a fall rate of thirty - three percent  our population appears to be representative of older community - dwelling adults in terms of fall rate . 
 fall rates in older - old adults ( over 75 years ) have been shown to vary seasonally  but consistent data for the general population of healthy older community - dwelling adults has not been previously reported . 
 one previous study grouped the peak seasons of winter and autumn together and found differences in fall rates . 
 manipulation of our data in a similar way reveals that there were more falls during the autumn / winter half year compared to spring / summer ( table 2 ) . 
 these seasonal differences may be related to intrinsic factors that may be subject to seasonal variation ( e.g.  vitamin d  physical activity  and muscle strength )   as well as seasonally related environmental factors ( e.g.  weather  temperature ) . 
 further research needs to investigate interventions to address potentially modifiable factors to reduce the increased falls risk in the autumn / winter period . 
 our data indicates a higher rate of falls in summer than has previously been reported  perhaps due to activity characteristics of our cohort . 
 summer and winter falls differ between the genders  with more men falling due to slips in winter and more women falling due to trips in summer . the high proportion of women in our study ( 79% ) may be a factor in the high rate of summer falls observed . 
 another factor to consider is the relationship between fall status and vitamin d. although 60 
 nmol / l has been determined to be the cutoff for fall - risk function  16/48 falls ( 33% ) occurred in participants in this study whose vitamin d was above that cutoff level . 
 this may be explained by the higher proportion of summer time falls observed in our study . during summer months  with longer hours of daylight at this latitude  a large proportion of the falls occurred in the outside ( 13 of the 14 falls 93% ) ( table 2 ) . 
 by contrast  in winter out - of - doors fall rate was reduced to 64%  indicating a higher winter time proportion of inside falls . for our generally healthy study population  
 it is likely that our participants were engaged in outdoor activities with higher associated risk of falls during the warmer weather ; for example  several summer falls occurred while bushwalking . 
 fall injuries  especially fractures  have been found to increase in winter ; this includes both inside ( hip ) and out - of - doors falls ( wrist ) . 
 studies in the area of seasonal variation in fracture rates provide good evidence for increased fracture rates from falls in winter  but these appear in populations with older participants than ours ( mean age over 75 years ) [ 8  13 ] . 
 our study recorded few injuries that required medical attention  hence making it difficult to compare serious fall injury data . 
 although this study aimed to recruit independently living community - dwelling older adults  bias in the sample may be present  as volunteers to this type of research project may be more robust than the community members at large . 
 the lack of more frail subgroups  including those with cognitive impairment  depression  or using walking aids  limits the generalisability of this study . 
 this study provides some evidence that measurements of postural sway may be affected by some effect of test - retest learning  and this needs to be considered in future research . 
 this is the first study to investigate the effects of season and postural sway and found that postural sway remained stable over the 12 months . 
 this study provides important evidence for clinicians and researchers that postural sway remains stable over an annual cycle but may be influenced by a learning effect .","

Abstract:
This study investigated the relationship between postural sway, serum vitamin D levels, and falls in older adults. Vitamin D levels varied seasonally, but postural sway remained stable throughout the year. Higher postural sway was associated with a greater risk of fall injuries.

Research and Discussion:
In a longitudinal observational study, 88 older adults were evaluated multiple times over the course of a year. Vitamin D levels were found to vary seasonally, with higher levels in the summer. Incidence of falls was lower in the spring and higher in the autumn. However, postural sway was not significantly related to vitamin D or fall rates.

Results and Conclusion:
The results of this study provide important evidence for clinicians and researchers working with older adults. While postural sway remained stable throughout the year, vitamin D levels varied seasonally and higher postural sway was associated with increased risk of fall injuries. This highlights the need for interventions to measure balance outcomes across different seasons. "
"since the dawn of history  nature and natural sources  such as plants  animals  microbes  and minerals have remained a veritable source of bioactive compounds with medicinal values . among these sources  plants have been the most explored and exploited for their bioactive medicinal components . 
 lead compounds  or templates for the rational development of drugs are of more specific efficacies and fewer side effects ( 1 ) . 
 one of the botanicals of interest in which the abortifacient claims in the folk medicine have been substantiated by scientific evidence ( 2 ) but with no documentation in the open scientific literature on its bioactive abortifacient agent(s ) is senna alata .

 the fruit is a pod  while the seeds are small and square in shape . 
 the plant has been claimed to be used in the management of several diseased conditions such as hepatitis  dermatitis  jaundice  gastroenteritis  eczema  constipation and diarrhoea ( 3  4 ) . 
 previous studies have shown that s. alata have antifungal  antibacterial and antioxidant activities ( 3  58 ) . 
 furthermore  yakubu et al . ( 2 ) reported that the aqueous leaf extract of the plant contained saponins ( 1.22% )  flavonoids ( 1.06% )  cardiac glycosides ( 0.20% )  phenolics ( 0.44% )  alkaloids ( 0.52% )  cardenolides and dienolides ( 0.18% ) . 
 aqueous leaf extract of s. alata has also been scientifically validated for its acclaimed use as an abortifacient ( 2 ) . 
 however  there is no study in the open scientific literature that has reported on the exact bioactive abortifacient agent(s ) in s. alata leaves . 
 therefore  the present study aimed to validate the speculation that the alkaloids in aqueous extract of s. alata leaves are responsible for its abortifacient activity . 
 the focus on alkaloid was a follow - up from our previous study that speculated on alkaloids to be responsible for the abortifacient activity of the crude extract of s. alata leaves and from several studies that implicated the phytochemical property of colchicine  quinazoline alkaloids  e.g. vasicine and vasicinone in several botanicals such as xylopia aethiopica  peganum harmala epigeal parts  areca catchu nuts and gloriosa superba roots as abortifacient bioactive agents and/or their role in the contraction and relaxation of uterine muscles ( 912 ) .

 data which were expressed as the meansd of six independent replicates were statistically analyzed using one - way analysis of variance and duncan multiple range test . 
 the alkaloids yielded 0.30 g which corresponds to 1.50% of the starting material of 500 g. the five different spots gave rf values of 0.28  0.33  0.39  0.47 and 0.55 . 
 the spots gave positive reaction with both meyer 's and wagner 's reagents producing a creamy precipitate and reddish - brown spots on a grey background ( tlc ) . 
 the alkaloid truncated the development of the fetuses as none of them survived in the experiment groups as against the average number of live fetuses of 10.26 in the distilled water - treated control animals ( table 1 ) . 
 the average weight of live fetuses in the controls was 4.92 g against none in all the extract - treated animals . 
 the percentage of fetal death in the 250  500 and 1000 mg / kg body weight of the alkaloid - treated animals was 6.03  6.00 and 6.50  respectively . 
 there was neither episode of abortion nor vaginal bleeding in all the alkaloid - treated animals . 
 both the number of implantation sites and corpora lutea decreased significantly ( p < 0.05 ) . while the implantation index was similarly high in all the alkaloid - treated animals  the resorption index  as well as pre- and post- implantation losses were many fold higher than the controls ( table 1 ) . 
 although  all the pregnant rats gained weight at the end of the experimental period ( final maternal weight ) compared with their weight prior to pairing with the males ( initial maternal weight ) ( table 1 )  the weight gained by the alkaloid - treated animals was about 50% less than the control animals . 
 furthermore  the feed and water intake by the animals treated by different doses of the alkaloid decreased significantly ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 effect of the alkaloids from senna alata leaves on some abortifacient parameters of pregnant rats values are expressed as meansd of six independent determinations ; test values carrying superscripts different from the control for each parameter in the same row are significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 maternal weights of the animals before pregnancy were compared with their corresponding weights after pregnancy for each treatment group ( p < 0.05 ) all different doses of the alkaloids significantly ( p < 0.05 ) decreased the serum concentrations of the follicle stimulating hormone  luteinizing hormone and progesterone in the pregnant animals ( table 2 ) . 
 effect of alkaloids from senna alata leaves on some female reproductive hormones of pregnant wistar rats values are expressed as meansd of six independent determinations ; test values carrying superscripts different from the control for each parameter in the same row are significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) the alkaloids also decreased ( p < 0.05 ) the absolute weight of the uterus  computed uterine to body weight ratio  and concentrations of uterine glucose and cholesterol ( table 3 ) . 
 in contrast  the concentration of uterine protein and the activity of alkaline phosphatase increased significantly ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 furthermore  the alkaloids did not provoke vaginal opening or cornification in any of the animals ( table 3 ) . 
 effect of alkaloids from senna alata leaves on some indices of oestrogenicity in pregnant rats values are expressed as meansd of six independent determinations ; test values carrying superscripts different from the control for each parameter in the same row are significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) 
 analysis of the tl chromatogram indicated that the mixture consisted of five alkaloids as evidenced by the creamy precipitates and reddish- brown spots produced with meyer 's and wagner 's reagents  respectively . in the present study  alkaloids from s. alata leaves significantly affected the fetal and maternal parameters of the animals . 
 for instance  the death of the fetuses in the alkaloid - treated pregnant rats may not only suggest inhibition of mitotic division of the fetuses ( 25 )  since the animals were exposed during the period of organogenesis  but may also show its relevance to the reduction in the concentrations of gonadotropins and progesterone in the present study . 
 ( 2 ) on the aqueous leaf extract of the plant where only the 500 and 1000 mg / kg body weight of the extract produced fetal death . 
 furthermore  the absence of abortion and vaginal bleeding in the alkaloid - treated animals which were hitherto observed with the crude extract in our previous study suggest zero abortifacient activity for the alkaloid . 
 therefore  the abortifacient activity of the aqueous extract of the plant leaf reported earlier ( 2 ) is not due to the alkaloidal content alone  but to some other phytochemicals such as saponins and flavonoids which may act synergistically or additively to produce the desired result . 
 it is interesting to note that both the number of implantation sites and corpora lutea decreased in the alkaloid - treated animals when the process of implantation ought to have been completed ( implantation takes place normally within 5 - 6 days post - coitus in rats ) before the exposure of the animals to the alkaloid mixture ( treatment commenced from day 10 of pregnancy ) . 
 the reason for this decrease is not immediately known but may not be unconnected with the consequence of some general hormonal effect ( reduced progesterone ) and/or absence of conceptuses growth ( 26 ) . 
 it is also possible that blastocytes were not activated and well - positioned before implantation  probably due to impaired muscular activity of the uterus ( 27 ) . 
 the implantation index and pre - implantation loss evaluates the number of blastocysts implanted in the uterus while the resorption index and post - implantation loss relate to the number of implanted blastocysts and those that have not developed ( 18  28 ) . 
 therefore  the high implantation index  and pre- and post- implantation losses suggest that pregnancy was interrupted by the alkaloid  probably creating an environment that was not conducive for the fertilized eggs . 
 normally  an abortion in most cases is accompanied by vaginal bleeding and when this is absent  the resorption will increase . 
 therefore  the increase in the resorption index in the alkaloid- treated animals confers antifertility effects ( such as anti - implantation  anti - blastocystic and antizygotic ) of the alkaloid . 
 the alkaloid did not exhibit complete abortifacient effect since the pregnant animals exposed to the alkaloid presented with closed vagina just like the controls . 
 the findings in the present study is similar to the report by elbetieha et al . 
 ( 29 ) where the administration of 200  400 and 800 mg / kg body weight of ethanolic extract of salvia fruticosa did not cause pregnancy failure but increased the number of resorption in the pregnant rats . 
 the alkaloids reduced the sense of taste and appetite of the animals as evidenced by the decrease in feed and water intake . 
 such reduction may account for the decrease in the computed percentage gain of maternal weight and may also be a consequence of impaired growth and development of the uterine contents ( 30 ) . 
 all these findings except those of feed and water intake  as well as maternal weight gain  contrast the previous report by yakubu et al . 
 it is well - known that for the implantation of the fetus and sustenance of pregnancy  an exact equilibrium must exist between the secretion of estrogen and progesterone ; this regulation is controlled by luteinizing and follicle stimulating hormones ( 31 ) . 
 thus  the reduction in the gonadotropins may equally be responsible for the reduced concentration of progesterone in the present study and this may not only account for the death of the fetuses  but also for the increase in the resorption sites . 
 the reduction in progesterone may suggest impaired endometrium function  which will adversely affect the normal secretion of special proteins required to nourish an implanted fertilized egg  and consequently  pregnancy failure . 
 thus  it is possible that the alkaloids posses anti - gonadotropic and anti - progestogenic activities which are inimical to the continued development of the fetuses . 
 many plant extracts with anti - fertility properties are known to exhibit estrogenic activity by increasing protein synthesis  uterine weight  water uptake and retention of fluid leading to ballooning of the uterus  uterine content of glucose  cholesterol  glycogen and alkaline phosphatase activity  thereby changing the uterine milieu and creating non - receptive conditions in the uterus ( 32 ) . 
 therefore  the contrasting effects the alkaloids on some of these parameters in the present study suggest that estrogenic activity was not total but selective . 
 the alkaloids exhibited more anti - oestrogenic activity ( 71.43% ) than oestrogenic ( 28.57% ) . 
 overall  the alkaloid from s. alata leaves at the oral doses of 250  500 and 1000 mg / kg body weight on daily basis from days 10 until day 18 post - coitum exhibited several potential effects on the maternal and fetal outcomes of pregnant rats ( anti - implantation  anti - gonadotropic  anti - progesteronic  selective estrogenic  embryonic resorption and fetotoxic activities )  but it could not induce abortion in the animals . therefore  the alkaloids may not alone be responsible for the abortifacient effects of the crude extract of s. alata which had been reported earlier . 
 finally  work is in progress on isolating the other phytochemicals ( saponins and flavonoids ) and evaluating their synergistic effects in pregnant animals .

Abstract: The study aimed to investigate the pregnancy terminating effects of alkaloids extracted from Senna alata leaves. Thin-layer chromatographic separation produced positive reactions with Meyer's and Wagner's reagents. Results showed decreased implantation sites and corpora lutea, as well as FSH, LH, and progesterone concentrations. The alkaloids exhibited anti-implantation, anti-gonadotropic, anti-progesteronic, and embryonic resorptive activities.

Research and Discussion: The study validated the abortifacient claim of Senna alata through analyzing its alkaloids. Results showed decreased reproductive indices and hormone levels, and increased resorption and toxicity. However, the alkaloids did not show complete abortifacient effects and may not be the sole bioactive agent in the leaf extract.

Results and Conclusion: The alkaloids from S. alata leaves displayed anti-implantation, anti-gonadotropic, anti-progesteronic, and feto-maternal toxic activities. However, they did not show complete abortifacient effects. Thus, the conclusion is that the alkaloids alone may not be the sole bioactive agent in the leaf extract and further research is needed to validate the speculated bioactive agent responsible for the abortifacient effects."
"erg protein expression has been recently suggested to be reflective of erg gene rearrangements in prostate cancer ( pca ) documenting remarkable concordance between the two [ 16 ] . 
 the rearrangements between the androgen receptor - regulated gene tmprss2 ( 21q22.3 ) and members of the ets family member of transcription factor gene  most commonly erg ( 21q22.2 )  are among the most common genetic alterations detected in prostate cancer [ 711 ] . 
 erg gene rearrangements have been detected in roughly half ( 4060% ) of pca of surgical cohorts compared to a rate of 12%15% in incidental or watchful waiting cohorts [ 7  1218 ] . 
 previous studies investigating the prognostic significance of erg gene rearrangements have revealed mixed results [ 1922 ] . 
 however  it is becoming more evident that erg gene rearrangements signify a molecular subtype of pca . 
 some studies investigating the significance of erg protein expression in localized pca failed to show association with adverse clinical outcome [ 23  24 ] . however  a recent report by our group demonstrated an association of erg expression with lethal disease in patients with unsuspected and advanced / castrate resistant disease who were treated by transurethral resection of prostate . moreover  we documented significant association between erg expression and both gleason score and tumor volume . 
 studies from our group and others have also linked erg status to responsiveness to hormonal therapy  and longer progression time to castration resistant disease  compared to men with no erg expression [ 24  25 ] . in the current study  we investigated the association of erg protein expression to clinical - pathological parameters in a cohort of men with localized prostate cancer . 
 the study cohort consisted of 198 patients who were treated by retropubic radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer with a mean followup of 4.8 years ( range 015.8 ) . 
 clinical progression was defined as a postoperative serum psa elevation of > 0.2  ng / ml . 
 prostate samples were embedded onto three tissue microarray ( tma ) blocks using a manual tissue arrayer ( beecher instruments  silver spring  md  usa ) . 
 one to nine cores ( average 3.3 )  0.6  mm in diameter  were sampled including benign  high grade intraepithelial neoplasia ( hgpin )  and prostate cancer ( pca ) . after construction  
 4  m sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin on the initial slides to verify the histological diagnosis . 
 briefly  4  m thick sections from formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded tissue blocks were stained with ventana autostainer . 
 prior to the staining  heat - induced antigen retrieval was carried out by vegetable steamer in sodium citrate antigen retrieval buffer ( 10  mm ph 6.0 ) for 40 minutes and then cooled down to room temperature for about 20 minutes . 
 the slides were incubated for 60 minutes at 37c with erg rabbit monoclonal antibody ( epitomics  clone epr 3864 ) at 1  :  50 dilution . a ventana iview dab detection kit ( ventana tucson  az  usa ) 
 the diagnoses of all tma cores were confirmed by the three study pathologists ( lht  cw  and tab ) . 
 for each patient  the two predominant patterns were sampled and included on the tmas for analysis . 
 erg protein expression was assessed semiquantitatively using 3-tiered system ( 0  negative ; 1  low ; 2  high ) . 
 cases with either 1 or 2 intensity were considered positive based on previous correlation with erg gene rearrangement as detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization ( data not shown ) . 
 the erg antibody was consistently strongly expressed in endothelial cells  which acted as internal control for expression and intensity level . 
 patient characteristics were presented as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and as means and ranges for continuous variables . 
 chi - square tests were used to test for associations between erg protein expression and gleason score  surgical margin  and pathological stage . the kaplan - meier approach along with the log - rank test was used for the survival analyses to test the association between erg expression and serum psa relapse . in all statistical tests  
 mean patients ' age of this cohort was 64 years ( range 42.780.5 years ) with average follow - up time of 4.8 years ( range 0.015.8 months ) . 
 table 1 demonstrates patients ' demographics of the study cohort with respect to erg expression . 
 overall  there were no significant differences between the two subgroups ( erg pos & erg neg ) of patients except for pathological stage  with 37% of erg positive tumors detected in pt3 versus 24% in pt2 . to investigate erg expression in different diagnostic categories  we characterized erg expression based on individual cores sampled . 
 when we accounted for foamy type pca morphology  the rate of erg expression was 15/84 ( 17.9% )  compared to 302/704 ( 42.9% ) in acinar pca ( cases with no foamy type morphology ) ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 there was no difference in high erg intensity between foamy type and acinar pca ( data not shown ) . however  mean intensity level of erg in acinar pca was significantly higher than foamy type pca  1.01  1.27 versus 0.37  0.83 ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 erg intensity levels in hgpin were comparable to those in foamy type pca but slightly lower ( 0.13  0.56 ) but significantly lower than those in acinar pca ( p < 0.001 ) ( figure 1 ) . 
 erg expression was noted in 106/280 ( 37.8% )  175/463 ( 37.8% )  and 37/108 ( 34.2% ) of gleason scores 6  7  and 810  respectively . 
 figure 2 demonstrates examples of erg expression in tissue samples and the distribution of erg in relation to gleason score . 
 when investigating relations between erg expression and pathological parameters  there was significant association between erg expression and higher disease stage . in this cohort  erg expression was present in 50/131 ( 38.1% ) patients with pt2 versus 30/55 ( 54.5% ) patients with pt3 ( p = 0.04 ) . 
 a similar association was also noted between erg expression and extra - capsular extension . in this cohort  52/134 ( 38.8% ) 
 erg positive patients demonstrated organ confined disease versus 29/53 ( 54.7% ) erg positive patients showing extra - capsular extension ( p = 0.04 ) . 
 similar trends were noted between erg expression and seminal vesicle invasion  but this was not statistically significant ( p = 0.10 ) ( data not shown ) . 
 no significant association was noted between overall erg positivity and positive surgical margins ( table 1 ) . 
 similarly  no association was observed with postsurgical psa levels when assessed by univariate or multivariate analysis ( figure 3 ) . although not informative due to limited patients ' numbers  the association between erg expression and higher stage disease was more pronounced in patients with higher gs . in this cohort  
 none of the patients with gs > 7 and erg positive ( 0/7 ) were of stage pt2 compared to 47% ( 7/15 ) of erg negative patients who were of pt2 stage ( p = 0.02 ) ( table 2 ) . 
 this study reports on the potential significance of erg protein expression in localized prostate cancer . 
 erg gene rearrangements and erg expression have been documented in roughly 50% of localized prostate and locally advanced castrate resistant prostate cancer compared to 12%15% in watchful waiting or incidental cohorts [ 16  17  22  25  29 ] . published reports on the significance of erg expression to patients ' outcome are conflicting with some showing association with adverse outcome  while others document no association . 
 some suggest that it indicates a better prognosis [ 16  22  25  2933 ] . 
 however  it is proposed that erg signifies a molecular class of prostate cancer and may play a role in disease progression within those tumors . 
 this pathway is closely linked to increased rate of pten genomic deletions as well as increased erg expression or erg gene rearrangements [ 34  35 ] . 
 erg gene rearrangements and erg expression are associated with adverse outcome and lethal disease in watchful waiting or expectant cohorts [ 16  25 ] . 
 moreover  patients with erg overexpression demonstrated shorter progression times to castrate resistance  needing surgical intervention ( channel turp ) . 
 in localized prostate cancer  the majority of the reported data suggest no prognostic implication for erg rearrangements or erg overexpression in relation to psa relapse or the recurrence of local disease [ 22  36  37 ] . 
 however  two earlier reports suggested adverse association of erg rearrangements with psa relapse after radical prostatectomy [ 20  31 ] . in nam 's study  
 yashimoto 's group noted that the adverse prognostic association was linked to pten genomic deletions . of note  a study by reid et al . 
 documented that erg gene rearrangements in addition to pten genomic deletions had actually favorable outcomes compared to pten deletion alone . 
 these observations suggest that the method utilized in determining erg status  the inclusion or exclusion of other genomic aberration  and the cohort chosen may be the reason for the different results obtained in various studies investigating the role of erg in prostate cancer . 
 our results support previous observations showing no prognostic relationship between erg overexpression and clinical outcome in localized prostate cancer . 
 however  in contrast to earlier studies  we document significant association between erg expression and some pathological parameters . in this cohort  patients whose tumors were erg positive were at higher risk of exhibiting extra - prostatic extension and increased disease stage compared to patients whose tumors did not express erg . 
 specifically  all patients with gs > 7 and erg expression showed pt3 stage disease compared to none of pt2 . however  this data is limited by the number of patients within each gs subgroup and need further confirmation . 
 more importantly  in addition to not documenting any clinical prognostic significance for erg expression  we did not observe any association between erg expression and other pathological parameters such as gleason score or surgical margins  which further diminishes any potential prognostic significance for erg expression  at least in localized pca . 
 another issue worth mentioning regarding erg is that  erg gene rearrangements have been previously associated with specific histopathological features and detected more frequently in some morphologic variants of prostate cancer than others . in this study  we confirm lower rates of erg expression in tumors with foamy / xanthomatous morphology which demonstrated lower mean expression intensities compared to acinar pca . 
 the significance of this is not yet known  but suggests that those two types of tumors may be different at the molecular level . in conclusion  this study demonstrates significant association between erg expression and extra - prostatic extension and higher pathological stage in localized prostate cancer . 
 moreover  the lack of association with any other pathological parameters also significantly diminishes any potential clinical application of erg expression  at least in men with localized prostate cancer .","

Abstract:

We investigated the prognostic significance of erg expression in a localized cohort of men with prostate cancer. Results showed a significant association between erg levels and extra-prostatic extension and higher pathological stage.

Research and Discussion:
Erg expression was detected in 43.4% of patients and correlated with pathological parameters such as gleason score and surgical margin. Erg levels were also significantly higher in acinar type carcinoma compared to foamy type and hgpin.

Results and Conclusion:
We found no significant association between erg expression and clinical outcome or serum PSA levels. However, there was a strong correlation with extra-prostatic extension and higher pathological stage, suggesting limited prognostic value in localized prostate cancer."
"the three main arteries of the leg  the anterior tibial artery ( ata )  posterior tibial artery and peroneal artery  form a dense vascular network around the distal leg  ankle  and foot  which ramifies perforators as the basis of all kinds of pedicle flaps such as lateral or medial malleolar perforator flaps . 
 there is plenty of literature describing the anatomy and clinical application of perforators of the peroneal artery and posterior tibial artery around the distal lower leg . 
 however  literature regarding perforator flaps of ata or anterior supramalleolar artery ( asma )  one of the major branches of distal ata  are scant . 
 these papers either mention the existence of the perforators from ata or asma  or describe their communication with the medial and lateral supramalleolar arteries . none of them have a detailed anatomical study on asma . 
 the objective of this study was to identify the anatomic parameters of the asma and its perforators that would enable microsurgeons to harvest potentially multi - paddle flaps or composite flaps from the foot and ankle region . 
 we try to preserve the ata intact after we harvest the composite flaps around the ankle using asma . 
 we also want to use the ata as the only one pedicle and harvest multi - paddle flaps  decreasing the microsurgical risk greatly and minimizing the sacrifice of the blood supply to the ankle and foot . 
 after the study was approved by the university of louisville irb ; 24 lower extremities of fresh human cadavers were studied . 
 the ata was cannulated and injected with 20 ml of red latex ( microfilm  flow tech  inc .  ) at the mid - point of lower leg where ata can be identified between the extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior muscles . 
 then  careful dissection along the distal 1/3 of the lower leg  the ankle  and the proximal foot ( 8 - 10 cm above the lateral malleolus and 1 - 2 cm anterior to the edge of the fibula ) was performed to observe the origin and the course of the asma . 
 the distance between the origin of asma and the extensor retinaculum ( o - r ) was recorded . 
 the diameters of the asma proper as well as its branches ( a set of fixed - width hooks was used for measurement )  and the length of asma were measured . 
 the collaterals between asma and the medial and lateral supramalleolar arteries and the number of perforators were observed . 
 chi - square test was used for this study to analyse the variation of the o - r . 
 fasciocutaneous flaps with multiple skin paddles were elevated based on the perforators to demonstrate its potential application . 
 we classified the asma into four types according to the pattern of origin from the ata [ figures 1 - 4 ] . 
 type a ( n = 10 ) asma originates from the ata with a 1 - 1.5 cm long main trunk and then gives off its lateral and medial branches [ figure 1a and b ] ; each consists of 2 - 3 perforators . in type b ( n = 7 ) 
  the asma does not have a main trunk  and its lateral and medial branches stem directly from ata with the sites of origin at the same level [ figure 2a and b ] . 
 type c ( n = 6 ) is similar to type b  with the lateral and medial branches arising from the ata but at different origins [ figure 3a and b ] . 
 type d ( n = 1 ) has 2 medial  and 1 lateral branch arising from the ata [ figure 4a and b ] . 
 ( a ) type a  the anterior supramalleolar artery originates as an artery stem . 
 ( 1 ) short artery stem ; ( 2 ) lateral branches ; ( 3 ) medial branches ; ( 4 ) descendent perforators ; ( 5 ) ascendant perforators . ( 6 ) 
 proximal end of anterior tibial artery ( ata ) ; ( 7 ) distal end of ata ; ( 8) blood supply to tibia ; ( 9 ) extensor retinaculum ( b ) the anterior supramalleolar artery originates as a 1 - 1.5 cm short artery stem and then ramifies lateral and medial branches . 
 the medial branch gives off ascendant perforators and descendent perforators ( a ) type b  the anterior supramalleolar artery originates as lateral and medial artery branches at the same point . 
 ( 1 ) medial branches ; ( 2 ) ascendant perforators . ( 3 ) descendent perforators ; ( 4 ) lateral branches ; ( 5 ) proximal end of anterior tibial artery ( ata ) ; ( 6 ) distal end of ata ; ( 7 ) extensor retinaculum ; ( 8) blood supply to tibia ( b ) the anterior supramalleolar artery orients as lateral and medial artery branches at the same point . 
 the medial branch gives off ascendant perforators and descendent perforators ( a ) type c  the anterior supramalleolar artery originates as lateral and medial artery branches at the different point . 
 ( 1 ) medial branches ; ( 2 ) ascendant perforators . ( 3 ) descendent perforators ; ( 4 ) lateral branches ; ( 5 ) proximal end of anterior tibial artery ( ata ) ; ( 6 ) distal end of ata ; ( 7 ) extensor retinaculum ( b ) the anterior supramalleolar artery orients as lateral and medial artery branches at different point . 
 the medial branch gives off ascendant perforators and descendent perforators ( a ) type d - the anterior supramalleolar artery originates as lateral and two medial artery branches at the different point . 
 ( 1 ) medial branches ; ( 2 ) lateral branches ; ( 3 ) proximal end of anterior tibial artery ( ata ) ; ( 4 ) distal end of ata ; ( 5 ) extensor retinaculum ( b ) the anterior supramalleolar artery orients as one lateral and two medial arteries branches at different point the mean distance between the origin of the proximal branch of asma and the superior margin of the extensor retinaculum ( o - r ) was 2.0  0.8 cm . 
 the mean diameters of the medial branch ( d1 )  lateral branch ( d2 ) and the main trunk of the asma ( d3 ) ( only in type a ) were 1.0  0.2 mm  0.8  0.3 mm and 1.1  0.2 mm  respectively . the mean feasible length of the pedicles of the lateral flap ( l1 ) and medial flap ( l2 ) were 5.1  1.0 cm and 3.7  0.6 cm  respectively . 
 bi - foliate fasciocutaneous flaps can be harvested based on the medial and lateral branches of the type a asma with preservation of the ata [ figure 5 ] . 
 data of 24 specimens of the anterior supramalleolar artery the biofoliate flap using type a anterior supramalleolar artery 
 huber dissected 200 feet and was the first to describe the asma as a vessel arising about 5 cm above the ankle joint . 
 wee described that this septocutaneous branch of ata runs through the anterior crural septum between the tendons of tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus and gives out 3 perforators . 
 further named the reverse - flow flap based on the perforators of this artery as anterior tibial type iii . 
 later research showed that asma is always found in the distal 1/3 of the lower leg and appears 8 - 10 cm above the lateral malleolus  1 - 2 cm anterior to the edge of the fibula . in 2003  koshima dissected 4 ankles and described that the asma has 1 - 2 perforators just above the extensor retinaculum and gives off the anterolateral and anteromedial branches . 
 however  we still lack detailed anatomical knowledge of its origin  calibre and so on . 
 the diameters of the lateral and medial branches of asma are 0.8  0.3 mm and 1.0  0.2 mm  respectively . 
 the feasible pedicle lengths of these two branches are 5.1  1.0 cm and 3.7  0.6 cm  respectively . 
 thus  an island flap can be harvested based on one or both of the branches for defect coverage around the ankle . 
 in addition  due to its collateral connection with the posterior tibial artery and peroneal artery  a reverse - flow anterolateral or anteromedial flap can also be designed as described in literature . 
 the flaps with asma are very useful especially for patients who suffer from refractory malleolar ulcers due to paralysis  diabetes mellitus  venous stasis  or vasculitis . for patients who have cosmetic consideration  
 perforator - based adipofascial flap is also a good option with the use of asma . 
 the perforators of the asma are suitable for a bi - foliate design in situations such as simultaneous defects of the volar and dorsal aspects of the hand . 
 the flap based on asma is pliable and thin  which makes it an excellent option for hand and wrist coverage . 
 if there is a simultaneous metacarpal deficiency at the same time  which can present especially in high - energy injuries  vascularised bone graft can also be harvested easily supplied by 1 - 2 perforators according to research by gilbert et al . 
 an additional advantage of this perforator flap is that the ata can be preserved in type a asma  and morbidity of the donor site can be minimised . 
 based on different types of asma  its lumen size can vary from 0.8  0.3 to 1.1  0.2 mm  which is still suitable for microvascular anastomosis . a difficult problem that a hand surgeon encounters 
 conventional methods include inserting the hand into an abdominal pocket for several weeks followed by skin graft  using a large flap to cover all the defects together  or covering the wounds with several free flaps at the same time 
 . often  these patients will still exhibit stiff digits and a bulky hand . and combined multiple single flaps would increase the surgical risk exponentially . in this instance  we propose a novel idea of using a multiple - foliate flap based on different perforators of the lateral and medial branches of the asma to cover multiple digits at the same time . 
 these branches all derive from the same trunk - the ata and its terminal branch . 
 this design provides the capability of harvesting up to 2 - 3 skin paddles based on one sizable pedicle  the ata . 
 the terminal branches of the peroneal artery to ankle and foot  as well as the branches of posterior tibial artery to ankle and foot are also preserved . in this way 
  the vascular network of the ankle and foot is still preserved  and donor site morbidity is significantly decreased . 
 there are several factors which should be kept in mind during the clinical application of asma based flaps . when the skin is opened  the lateral and medial branches of the asma are generally visible . 
 if we want only the stem artery and their branches  we can just follow the course of these branches and easily find the origin of these branches . 
 . however  in any situation it would be more effective to repair the extensor retinaculum carefully and immobilize the foot for 3 - 4 weeks . 
 further study and long - term follow - up are needed to understand the blood supply of the ankle and foot after harvesting the asma - based flap . 
 its sizable diameter and lengthy pedicle make it suitable as bi - foliate fasciocutaneous flaps or composite flaps .","

1) Abstract 

The anterior supramalleolar artery (ASMA) is a constant anatomical structure with four different types of origin. This study examined the type of origin, course and diameter of the pedicle, and distance to the extensor retinaculum. Results showed that the ASMA has a significant potential for bi-foliate fasciocutaneous flap transfer in reconstructive surgery.

2) Research and Discussion 

Twenty-four fresh lower limb specimens were injected with latex for dissection to analyze the characteristics of the ASMA for potential applications in reconstructive surgery. Four types of origins were found, and the mean distance from the origin of the ASMA to the extensor retinaculum was 2.0  0.8 cm. The diameter of the ASMA branches and pedicle length of the flaps were also measured and recorded.

3) Results and Conclusion 

The ASMA was found to have a sizable diameter and a lengthy pedicle, making it suitable for bi-foliate fasciocutaneous flap transfer. The four types of origins provide a consistent and reliable anatomical basis for using the ASMA in reconstructive surgery procedures. This study highlights the potential of the ASMA as an important anatomical structure for future reconstructive surgeries and warrants further investigation."
"ankle dorsiflexion passive range of motion ( df prom ) measurements are performed in the 
 field of physical therapy to estimate ankle motion during functional activities1 and to prevent lower extremity injuries2 . 
 although in the clinical setting  ankle df 
 prom is frequently measured under non - weight - bearing ( non - wb ) conditions1  3  4  many researchers have stated that the wb 
 position is more appropriate for estimating the amount of ankle df motion during functional 
 activities5  6 . therefore  wb ankle df prom should be measured during interventions 
 focused on increasing ankle df prom . 
 limited ankle df prom with knee extended may result from gastrocnemius tightness and 
 insufficient posterior talar glide7 . 
 thus  
 gastrocnemius stretching and talocrural joint mobilization have been performed as 
 intervention strategies to increase ankle df prom3  
 8  9 . 
 previous studies have reported a significant increase in ankle df 
 prom after these interventions3  8  9 ; however  to our 
 knowledge  no study has demonstrated the combined effect of both interventions on wb ankle 
 df prom . 
 therefore  the aim of the present study was to examine the influence of 
 gastrocnemius stretching combined with joint mobilization on wb ankle df prom . 
 in total  11 male subjects with bilateral limited non - wb ankle df prom with knee extended 
 ( mean age  22.82  3.09  years ; mean height  175.91  3.39  cm ; mean weight  69.55  3.78  kg ; 
 mean non - wb ankle df prom  4.17  2.48 ) participated in this study . 
 inclusion criteria were 
 1 ) ankle df prom with knee extension < 10 ; 2 ) ankle df prom with knee flexion > 10 ; 
 and 3 ) > 5 difference in ankle df prom between knee extension and knee flexion 
 conditions on bilateral sides in non - wb positions3 . 
 subjects with a history of surgery on the lower extremity  
 fracture  or neurological diseases were excluded from this study . 
 all participants signed an 
 informed consent form approved by the institutional research review committee of inje 
 university prior to participation in this study . 
 the study protocol of this study complies 
 with the ethical standard of the declaration of helsinki . 
 wb ankle df prom with knee extended was measured following the procedures suggested by 
 munteanu et al10 . 
 subjects stood in front 
 of a wall and placed the leg being tested behind the contralateral leg in a lunge posture . 
 subjects were asked to place both hands on the wall and then lean forward without heel - off 
 and knee flexion until maximum stretch was felt in the gastrocnemius on the tested leg . 
 the 
 force applied to the tested leg was maintained at 60  5% of the subject s weight using 
 scales11 . 
 an examiner determined the 
 maximum tibial inclination using an inclinometer to measure the wb ankle df prom with knee 
 extended . 
 measurements of wb ankle df prom were repeated 3 times for each ankle under pre- 
 and post - intervention conditions . 
 the mean value of 3 trials was used for data analysis . for gastrocnemius stretching combined with joint mobilization  subjects leaned forward 
 against the wall in the same lunge posture as that during measurement of wb ankle df prom 
 with knee extended until the maximum gastrocnemius stretch was felt . 
 subjects held the 
 end - range posture while an examiner provided the talus of the tested leg with sustained 
 anterior - to - posterior gliding force . 
 an intervention trial was performed for 30  s  and 10 
 trials were repeated with 30-s rest periods for each ankle . the difference in wb ankle df prom with knee extended between pre- and post - intervention 
 conditions was analyzed using a paired t - test . 
 wb ankle df prom with knee extended was significantly increased in post - intervention 
 compared with pre - intervention conditions ( 42.60  5.49 versus 38.24  4.69  p < 
 0.001 ) . 
 our findings demonstrate that gastrocnemius stretching combined with joint mobilization 
 significantly increases wb ankle df prom with knee extended . stretching exercises 
 increase 
 tolerance  resulting in increased rom12 . 
 additionally  increased displacement of the myotendinous junction ( mtj ) after gastrocnemius 
 stretching for 5  min was found in a previous study13 . 
 therefore  the change in tolerance and/or increase in mtj 
 displacement might have influenced our findings . 
 the addition of talocrural joint 
 mobilization to gastrocnemius stretching is another possible explanation for our findings . 
 previous research by dinh et al.3 showed a 
 4.25 increase in wb ankle df prom with knee extended after gastrocnemius stretching alone 
 for 3 weeks . although gastrocnemius stretching combined with joint mobilization 
 was applied 
 for 5  min in the present study  the amount of increase in wb ankle df prom after 
 intervention ( i.e.  4.36 ) was similar to that found previously . considering this outcome  
 despite the relatively short period of intervention in the present study  it may be inferred 
 that the addition of talocrural joint mobilization might maximize the effects of general 
 gastrocnemius stretching . 
 thus  we 
 conclude that gastrocnemius stretching combined with joint mobilization might decrease 
 gastrocnemius tightness and increase posterior talar gliding movement  which effectively 
 increases wb ankle df prom with the knee extended . 
 first  although non - wb ankle df prom was used as 
 an inclusion criterion  changes in non - wb ankle df prom after intervention were not 
 measured . 
 however  we believe that wb ankle df prom is clinically more important because 
 most functional activities are performed under the wb condition . 
 second  our study included 
 only male subjects  and the results can not be generalized to women .","

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of combining gastrocnemius stretching with talocrural joint mobilization on weight-bearing ankle dorsiflexion passive range of motion in individuals with limited ankle movement. Eleven male subjects were involved and results showed a significant increase in ankle dorsiflexion after the intervention.

Research and Discussion:
The study involved utilizing talocrural joint mobilization and gastrocnemius stretching for subjects with limited ankle range of motion. An inclinometer was used to measure the range of motion before and after the intervention. The results showed a significant increase in weight-bearing ankle dorsiflexion, indicating the effectiveness of this combined approach.

Results and Conclusion:
The results of this study suggest that the combination of joint mobilization and stretching are effective in increasing weight-bearing ankle dorsiflexion passive range of motion. This has implications for individuals with limited ankle movement and can be incorporated into rehabilitation and exercise programs to improve overall ankle function. Further research is needed to confirm these findings."
"dox is one of the key chemotherapeutic drugs for cancer treatment  but its use is limited by chronic and acute toxic side effects . 
 dox is an antibiotic anthracycline that was isolated from a pigment of streptomyces peucetius in the early 1960s and it had been employed for more than 30 years in the battle against cancer  but it is now chemically synthesized . 
 renal dox - induced toxicity may be part of a multiorgan damage mediated mainly through free radical formation eventually leading to membrane lipid peroxidation . 
 induction of apoptosis and modulation of nox are mechanisms that are involved in toxic adverse effects associated with dox therapy . in addition  dox has a direct renal damaging effect as it accumulates preferentially in the kidney . 
 dox has toxic effects on other organs such as heart and liver which may lead to modulation of blood supply to the kidney and alter xenobiotic detoxification processes  respectively  thus indirectly contributing to dox - induced nephropathy . 
 dia is a new anti - inflammatory  analgesic  and antipyretic drug that was developed specially for the treatment of osteoarthritis . 
 it is highly effective in relieving the symptoms of osteoarthritis and may be able to modify the course of the disease . 
 interleukin 1 is a proinflammatory and proapoptotic agent that induces cytokine production by activating nfb and mitogen activated protein kinase signaling . 
 a major cause of dox - induced nephrotoxicity is the production of reactive oxygen species which induce cytokines  including interleukin 1 [ 6  9  10 ] . 
 the aim of the present study was to study the effect of the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist diacerein ( dia ) on dox - induced nephropathy . 
 dia powder was from eva pharma company and it was dissolved in 1% carboxymethylcellulose . dox hydrochloride 10  mg vial ( pharmacia italia  spa  italy )  polyclonal rabbit / antirat caspase-3  tnf  and nfb antibody ( lab vision  usa )  biotinylated goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( transduction laboratories  usa )  urea  gsh  sod  and catalase kits ( biodiagnostic  egypt )  and creatinine ( humen  germany ) were purchased . 
 adult male wistar rats weighing about 250350  g were obtained from the animal research centre  giza  egypt . 
 animals were kept in standard housing conditions in cages and were left to acclimatize for one week . 
 this work was conducted in the pharmacology department  faculty of medicine  el - minia university  egypt  and the animal experimental protocol was approved by the faculty board . 
 rats were randomly assigned into 6 groups ( n = 6 each ) as follows . 
 group i received vehicle ( 1% carboxymethylcellulose ) for 15 days and ip saline at day 11 . 
 group ii was treated with dld ( 25  mg / kg / d orally ) for 15 days and ip saline at day 11 . 
 group iii was treated with dhd ( 50  mg / kg / d orally ) and ip saline at day 11 . 
 group iv was treated with vehicle for 15 days and dox ( 15  mg / kg ) at day 11 . 
 group v was treated with dld ( 25  mg / kg / d orally ) for 15 days + ip injection of dox ( 15  mg / kg ) at day 11 . 
 group vi was treated with dhd ( 50  mg / kg / d orally ) for 15 days + ip injection of dox ( 15  mg / kg ) at day 11 . 
 the doses of dox and dia were based on the previous studies [ 4  11 ] . 
 group i received vehicle ( 1% carboxymethylcellulose ) for 15 days and ip saline at day 11 . 
 group ii was treated with dld ( 25  mg / kg / d orally ) for 15 days and ip saline at day 11 . 
 group iii was treated with dhd ( 50  mg / kg / d orally ) and ip saline at day 11 . 
 group iv was treated with vehicle for 15 days and dox ( 15  mg / kg ) at day 11 . 
 group v was treated with dld ( 25  mg / kg / d orally ) for 15 days + ip injection of dox ( 15  mg / kg ) at day 11 . 
 group vi was treated with dhd ( 50  mg / kg / d orally ) for 15 days + ip injection of dox ( 15  mg / kg ) at day 11 . 
 the doses of dox and dia were based on the previous studies [ 4  11 ] . 
 after 4 days of dox injection  each rat was weighed then anesthetized with ip injection of urethane ( 25% in a dose of 1.6  gm / kg ) and then sacrificed . 
 a longitudinal section of the left kidney and one half was fixed in 10% formalin then embedded in paraffin for histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations . 
 the rest of the kidneys were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 80c . 
 briefly  the method is based on the fact that sulfhydryl group of gsh reacts with 5  5-dithiobis ( 2-nitrobenzoic acid ) ( ellman 's reagent ) and produces a yellow colored 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid which was measured colorimetrically at 405  nm using beckman du-64 uv / vis spectrophotometer  usa . 
 assessment of renal catalase antioxidant enzyme activity was determined from the rate of decomposition of h2o2 at 510  nm after the addition of tissue homogenate as described by colorimetric kit . 
 the assessments of sod levels were based on the ability of the enzyme to inhibit the phenazine methosulfate - mediated reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium dye and the results were expressed as unit / g tissue . 
 the renal contents of lipid peroxides were assayed by a spectrophotometric method based on the reaction between mda and thiobarbituric acid . 
 the absorbance values of the samples and the blank were determined at 535  nm using a ( beckman du-64 spectrophotometer  usa ) and then blank absorbance value was subtracted from the sample absorbance value . from a standard curve  mda concentration in the unknown sample was extrapolated from the corresponding absorbance using the regression line from the standard curve and expressed as nmol / gm tissue by multiplying in the tissue dilution factor . 
 nitric oxide ( no ) in the form of nitrite was determined with spectrophotometric method using griess reagent systems . 
 the stable oxidation end products of no  nitrite ( no2 )  and nitrate ( no3 ) were used as indicators of no production . 
 nox was measured after the reduction of nitrate to nitrite by copperized cadmium granules in glycine buffer at ph 9.7 . 
 quantification of no2 was based on the griess reaction  in which a chromophore with a strong absorbance at 540  nm is formed by the reaction of nitrite with a mixture of n - naphthylene diamine and sulfanilamide . 
 the absorbance of the sample and the blank were measured at 545  nm using ( beckman du-64 spectrophotometer  usa ) . 
 the blank absorbance is then subtracted from the sample absorbance . from a standard curve  nox content in the unknown sample 
 was extrapolated from the corresponding absorbance using the regression line from the standard curve and expressed as nmol / g tissue . 
 renal tissue was fixed in 10% formalin  embedded in paraffin  sectioned by a microtome at 5  m thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for routine histopathological assessment . 
 the renal tissues were examined in random microscopic areas semiquantitatively under 40 high power fields and the number of changes was assessed by the counting of 3 nonoverlapped fields for the same slide of each animal . 
 the frequency and the severity of lesions in the kidneys were assessed semiquantitatively as follows : score  : assigned normal  score + : in between normal and mild  score + + ( mild level ) : less than 25% of the examined fields revealed histological alterations  score + + + ( moderate level ) : less than 50% of the examined fields revealed histological alterations  and score + + + + ( severe level ) : less than 75% of the total fields examined revealed histological alterations . 
 the caspase-3  tnf  and nfb immunolabeled cells were counted . in each animal  3 sections were examined and the cells were counted in 3 adjacent nonoverlapping fields levels . 
 immunohistochemical staining was performed for caspase-3  tnf  and nfb using polyclonal rabbit / antirat antibody according to previously published protocol [ 20  21 ]  respectively . 
 table 1 shows the results of the effect of dia on serum creatinine and urea . 
 rats receiving a single dose of dox ( 15  mg / kg  ip ) showed a significant increase in serum creatinine and urea levels compared to control group . 
 both doses of dia resulted in significant decrease in serum creatinine compared to dox treated rats . 
 dia 50  mg / kg / day but not 25  mg / kg / day resulted in significant decrease in serum urea compared to dox treated rats . 
 renal mda was evaluated as an indicator of kidney lipid peroxidation and nitrites and nitrates as an indicator of renal nox levels ( table 1 ) . 
 dox ( 15  mg / kg ) significantly increased renal mda and nox levels compared to control group . administrating both doses of dia to dox treated rats significantly decreased mda and nox compared to dox treated group . 
 treatment with dox ( 15  mg / kg ) caused significant decrease in renal gsh  sod  and catalase levels compared with untreated control group ( table 2 ) . 
 concomitant treatment of dox with dia significantly increased the levels of renal gsh  sod  and catalase compared to dox treated group . 
 the histological study of the rat renal cortical tissue of control group ( figure 1(a ) )  dld ( 25  mg / kg / day ) group ( figure 1(b ) )  and dhd ( 50  mg / kg / day ) group ( figure 1(c ) ) showed normal architecture of renal glomeruli and tubules . dox treated group ( figure 1(d ) ) showed marked enlargement of some vascular glomeruli which tightly fill the renal corpuscles . 
 dox + dld group ( figure 1(e ) ) showed amelioration of the damaging effects of dox . 
 there were less tubular distortion  narrow bowman 's spaces  and fewer cytoplasmic vacuolations of renal corpuscle and tubular cells were also observed . 
 dox + dhd group ( figure 1(f ) ) had more obvious decrease in the morphological changes caused by dox exposure . 
 the severity of the morphological changes was assessed semiquantitatively ; dox exposed group showed increase in the glomerular and tubular morphological changes at the light microscopic levels when compared with control group . 
 these changes were suppressed by the administration of both doses of dia  but the high dose showed marked improvement than the low dose ( table 3 ) . 
 administration of dox caused significant increase in the immunoreactivity of caspase-3  nfb  and tnf ( figures 2  3  and 4 and table 4 ) respectively  which were highly expressed in both renal glomeruli and tubules cytoplasmically and in some nuclei . 
 administration of both doses of dia concomitantly with dox decreased the expression of them  compared to dox group . 
 administration of both doses of dia in vehicle treated rats alone and control groups showed no expression . 
 effective anticancer therapy with anthracyclines as dox is limited because of its toxicity to various organs including kidneys . 
 nephrotoxic action of dox is also considered to be via drug - induced free radical generation . 
 the formation of free radicals induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines as interleukin 1 initiating the biological effects associated with inflammation . 
 this directed our attention to investigate the role of dia which is interleukin 1 receptor antagonist as a possible nephroprotective agent against dox - induced renal damage . 
 induction of dox nephrotoxicity was detected in our study by significant elevation of serum urea and creatinine levels which were confirmed by toxic histopathological changes compared to control group . 
 urea and serum creatinine are the most sensitive markers of nephrotoxicity implicated in the diagnosis of renal injury [ 24  25 ] . 
 the nephrotoxic effect of dox is characterized by decreasing glomerular filtration rate leading to a rise in serum urea and creatinine . 
 our results are in good agreement with the previous studies [ 22  26 ] . 
 improvement of dox - induced nephrotoxicity was previously tried by compounds that partially succeeded in preserving normal renal function and structure probably through their antioxidant and anti - inflammatory effects as caffeic acid phenethyl ester  zingiber officinale roscoe  and solanum torvum   so that we investigated the role of another antioxidant and anti - inflammatory drug as dia on dox - induced nephrotoxicity . dia 
 could significantly decrease serum urea and creatinine compared to dox treated group . that is due to the anti - inflammatory and antioxidant effects of dia which suppress dox mediated oxidative stress  inflammation  and tissue damage . 
 our histopathological changes showed that dox treated group presented with marked damage of renal tubules . 
 these results are in agreement with zhao et al .   who detected the protective effect of rhein ( the active metabolite of dia ) on acetaminophen induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in rats . 
 they found that serum urea and creatinine significantly decreased in rhein and acetaminophen coadministration compared to acetaminophen group and normalization of toxic histopathological changes . 
 the elevated levels of gsh could effectively provide thiol group for the possible gsh mediated detoxification reactions of gpx ( glutathione peroxidase ) and gst ( glutathione - s - transferase ) which is involved in the scavenging of o2 generated from the dox . 
 our findings are consistent with the previous reports that showed that gsh concentration is significantly decreased upon dox treatment compared to control group [ 4  22 ] . 
 sod extensively distributes in all cells and has a significant shielding role against oxidative injury induced by reactive oxygen species . in our study 
  the activities of sod and catalase significantly decreased in dox treated rats in kidney as compared to control rats . 
 the accumulation of these highly reactive free radicals leads to the reduction of the activity of sod and catalase which in turn results in damaging effects in the form of loss of cell membrane integrity and function . 
 the decrease in the sod and catalase activities related to the increase in the intracellular levels of h2o2 . 
 catalase has been reported to be responsible for the detoxification of h2o2  which is an effective inhibitor of sod . 
 coadministration of dia significantly improved sod  gsh  and catalase levels compared to dox treated group . 
 these results may be due to antioxidant effect of dia which was approved previously by tamura et al .   who indicated the inhibitory effect of dia on indomethacin - induced gastric ulceration which could be mediated by the suppression of reactive oxygen species production based on its inhibition of neutrophil activation and antioxidant activity . 
 in addition  hu et al .   investigated the protective effects of rhein lysinate ( rhl )  against kidney impairment in senescence - prone inbred strain 10 ( samp10 ) mice . 
 treatment of samp10 mice with rhl significantly increased the sod and gpx levels in the kidneys . 
 o2 reacts with lipid to form lipid peroxides followed by -oxidation to form mda . that was detected in our study which showed significant increase of mda level in dox treated group compared to control group . 
 these results are in agreement with el - sheikh et al .   and yagmurca et al . 
 the high production of nox results in peroxynitrite formation which is a potent and aggressive cellular oxidant and is involved in dox toxicity . 
 the current findings showed that dox administration significantly increased renal level of nox compared to control group and that is in agreement with other studies [ 26  37 ] . 
 these results are in agreement with zhao et al .   who detected the protective effect of rhein on acetaminophen induced nephrotoxicity in rats which was approved by significant decrease of mda and nox on coadministration of rhein plus acetaminophen group compared to acetaminophen group . 
 our results are in agreement with martel - pelletier and pelletier   who reported that no is produced through the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase and it is a major catabolic factor involved in the pathophysiology of oa . 
 our results are consistent with hu et al .   who investigated the protective effects of rhein lysinate ( rhl )  against kidney impairment in senescence - prone inbred strain 10 ( samp10 ) mice . 
 induction of p53 mediates cell apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 family of proteases and apoptotic cell death . 
 our study is showing significant increase in caspase-3 expression in dox treated group in comparison with control group . 
 our study is in consistence with torina et al .   who showed that treatment with dia once a day for 4 weeks after myocardial infarction improved ventricular remodeling by partial blockage of the proinflammatory cytokines which led to lower caspase-3 activity and nfb p65 transcription b pathway . 
 dox - induced superoxide anion production which was reported to be responsible for tnf-induced nuclear factor ( nf ) activation that increases nf and tnf over expression . 
 our study showed significant increase in tnf and nfb expressions in dox group compared to control group and the same results were found with al - saedi et al . . 
 coadministration of dia significantly decreased tnf and nfb expression compared to dox treated group that is in agreement with gadotti et al .   who showed that dia inhibits neuropathic pain by decreasing proinflammatory cytokines as tnf and nf. also  hu et al . 
 the active metabolite of dia is rhein which possesses anti - inflammatory activity and may be effective in suppressing the inflammatory cytokines contributing to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy . 
 .   demonstrated that rhein had protective effect in different models of nephropathy as iga induced nephropathy  obstructive nephropathy  chronic allograft nephropathy  and high glucose and angiotensin ii induced nephropathy . 
 oral administration of rhein ( 150  mg / kg / d ) ameliorated renal lesions . 
 rhein was capable of protecting against renal injury by decreasing the activities of nfb and caspase-3 in the early phase of glomerulosclerosis . 
 our results are consistent with meng et al .   who reported that rhein possesses various pharmacological activities  including anti - inflammatory  antioxidant  and antitumor . 
 in their study  a model of hyperuricemia and nephropathy induced by adenine and ethambutol in mice was established . 
 the results demonstrated that rhein significantly improved the symptoms of nephropathy through decreasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines  including interleukin 1  prostaglandin e2  and tnf. yu et al . 
 aimed to explore the effect of rhein on sepsis - induced acute kidney injury by injecting lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) and cecal ligation and puncture ( clp ) in vivo and on lps - induced hk-2 cells in vitro . 
 rhein could significantly decrease concentration of serum urea and creatinine and level of tnf  nfb  and il-1 in two different mouse models of experimental sepsis . 
 in conclusion  dia protected against dox - induced nephrotoxicity in rats most probably due to its antioxidant and anti - inflammatory activities . however  dhd ( 50  mg / kg / day ) showed more protective effect than dld ( 25  mg / kg / day ) .","

Abstract:
The study investigated the potential protective effects of diacerein in doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity through the modulation of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist. Diacerein at both low and high doses showed significant improvement in all measured parameters, with high dose exhibiting greater amelioration.

Research and Discussion:
In this study, diacerein was found to have a positive impact on doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity, possibly through its ability to regulate interleukin 1 receptor antagonist. Significant improvements were observed in various parameters, highlighting the potential therapeutic value of diacerein in mitigating nephrotoxicity.

Results and Conclusion:
The present study showed that diacerein can effectively ameliorate doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity, as evidenced by the improvement in serum biochemical markers, oxidative stress markers, and tissue pathology. Diacerein high dose was found to be more effective in reducing nephrotoxicity, further emphasizing the potential use of this drug in managing drug-induced kidney damage."
"suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents and has become a significant public health issue globally ( 1 ) . 
 statistics korea report 2014 showed that suicide is the cause of 28.4% of adolescent deaths in 2013  and it was the number one cause of death among adolescents ( 2 ) . 
 furthermore  suicide is the second to third cause of mortality among adolescents in the western world and is an important concern in developing countries ( 3 ) . 
 numerous causes of suicidal behavior during adolescence have been reported  including mental disorders  peer affiliations  and level of achievement in school ( 4 ) . 
 additionally  weight - related concerns are a common cause of suicidal behaviors ( 56 ) . 
 this transition often leads to confusion about personal identity  especially in the context of enduring developments in identity and cognition as well as physical growth ( 7 ) . 
 adolescents typically enter a period of a high level of self - consciousness about their body shape and size ( 8) . 
 they have a greater tendency to consider how they look to others at this life stage than during any other period of life ( 9 ) . 
 these weight - related issues are influenced by many factors including friends  peers  social norms  and media ( 10 ) . 
 the media is a particularly strong influence because it has become a general source of information and adolescents are easily exposed to it ( 11 ) . 
 the media encourages as "" ideal "" slim and thin body shapes for girls and muscular bodies for boys ( 1213 )  and provides abundant information on the newest diet methods and quick fixes for weight control ( 14 ) . 
 this may induce adolescents  who have a particularly keen interest in their figure  to distort their body image and to engage in unneeded or inappropriate weight control behaviors ( wcb ) ( 15 ) . 
 many adolescents engage in inappropriate wcb such as vomiting  taking nonprescription diet pills  and taking laxatives or diuretics . among korean adolescents engaging in wcb  
 13.4% of boys and 18.8% of girls took inappropriate methods to control their weight ( 16 ) . according to a study using data from national surveys  similar rates 
 were also observed in the united states  with 10% of boys and 21.3% of girls conducting at least one inappropriate wcb ( 17 ) . 
 inappropriate wcb are a harmful influence on adolescents ' physical and psychological development ( 12 ) . 
 for instance  a 5-year longitudinal study reported that engagement in inappropriate wcb can be a predictor of obesity and eating disorders ( 18 ) . 
 moreover  adverse outcomes of inappropriate wcb also include the onset of depression ( 19 ) and suicide ideation ( 20 ) . 
 due to the high prevalence of and the possible negative side effects associated with inappropriate wcb  it is a growing serious public health concern . 
 therefore  the prevention of inappropriate wcb among adolescents is imperative to protect them from negative physical and psychosocial consequences . to date 
  studies about inappropriate wcb merely suggest the association between inappropriate wcb and negative psychosocial consequences ( 212223 ) . in the present study  we investigate not only the association between inappropriate wcb and suicide ideation and attempt  but also the difference in this association with body mass index  body weight perception  and body shape misperception . moreover  we investigate the top five wcb combinations used by korean adolescents and examine the association between these five wcb combinations and suicide ideation and attempt . 
 we used a cross - sectional design ; thus  the results should be interpreted with caution due to possibility of a bi - directional effect . 
 we used data from the 2014 korea youth risk behavior web - based survey ( kyrbs ) . 
 the kyrbs has been conducted annually since 2005 by the korean centers for disease control and prevention ( kcdc )  the korea ministry of education  science and technology  and the korea health and human services . 
 the data were collected via an ongoing  anonymous web - based survey in a self - reporting format that was conducted on a nationally representative sample of middle- and high - school students . 
 it aimed to plan and assess the korean adolescent health promotion policies by investigating health - related behaviors and status . in the 2014 survey  
 799 middle and high schools were selected  including 72060 students in grades 7 to 12 ( stratified ) on a national scale . 
 however  we excluded 2334 individuals due to missing data for variables used in this study ; therefore  our cohort ultimately comprised 69726 adolescents ( 35224 boys and 34361 girls ) . 
 suicide ideation and attempt were measured via responses to the following questions : "" have you seriously considered suicide during the past 12 months ? "" and "" have you tried suicide during the past 12 months ? "" the possible responses to both questions were "" yes "" or "" no . "" 
 we characterized wcb via responses to the following multi - part question : "" have you experienced the following weight control methods during the past 30 days  with the following activities listed : 1 ) did regular exercise  2 ) fasted at least 24 hours  3 ) ate less  4 ) took prescription diet pills  5 ) took nonprescription diet pills  6 ) took laxatives or diuretics  7 ) vomited  8) ate only one food  9 ) took oriental medicine  and 10 ) ate diet food . "" the possible responses to all questions were "" yes "" or "" no . ""

 if participants responded ' no ' at all of 2 )  5)-8 )  we classified them into the "" appropriate wcb "" group . 
 if participants responded ' no ' to all activity choices  we classified them into the "" nothing "" group . body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated by self - reported height and weight . 
 bmi percentiles for age and gender were calculated according to the 2007 standard growth charts for korean children and adolescents by the korean pediatric society ( 24 )  and four categories were created : underweight (  15th percentile )  normal weight ( 16th to 84th percentile )  overweight ( 85th to 95th percentile )  and obese (  95th percentile or bmi  25 ) . 
 we further grouped overweight and obese groups into a single overweight group  thus using three bmi categories body weight perception ( bwp ) was split into five categories : very underweight  underweight  normal weight  overweight  and very overweight . 
 we further grouped these categories into three groups : thin  normal  and obese . 
 body shape misperception ( bsm ) was determined by an agreement between bmi and bwp categories . 
 participants perceiving their weight at least one category below their actual bmi categories were designated part of the "" underestimate "" group  while those perceiving their weight at least one category above their actual bmi were designated part of the "" overestimate "" group ( i.e.  if participants whose bmi was a normal weight perceived their body weight as obese  they were placed in the "" overestimate "" group ) ( 25 ) . 
 control variables included age  household economic status  parents ' presence  residential area  school level  academic achievement in school  subjective health status  sleep satisfaction  physical activity  current alcohol consumption  current smoker  stress level  and depression . 
 we performed statistical analyses of the survey data using sas version 9.4 ( sas inc .  
 the relevant primary sampling units  sample weights  and stratification were considered in the analysis given that the kyrbs was designed as a complex sample . 
 a pearson 's  test was used to determine significant differences in the distribution of each variable . 
 next  a logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between wcb and suicide ideation and attempt . 
 additionally  we performed a set of subgroup analyses using bwp  bmi  and bsm to determine whether body related variables led to differences in the association between wcb and suicide ideation and attempt . 
 results were presented as adjusted odds ratios ( ors ) with 95% confidence intervals ( 95% cis ) . 
 the ethics approval for the publicly open kyrbs data was waived by the institutional review board ( irb ) . 
 after the purpose of the survey was fully explained to the students  written informed consent was provided . 
 students were assured that they could refuse or withdraw from the research at any stage ( 16 ) .

 the demographics of the 35224 boys and 34361 girls in this study are listed in table 1 . of the participants  
 10.6% ( n = 3709 ) of boys and 15.0% ( n = 5172 ) of girls reported that they experienced suicide ideation  while 2.1% ( n = 722 ) of boys and 3.4% ( n = 1151 ) of girls reported attempting suicide . 
 33.5% ( n = 11827 ) of boys and 45.2% ( n = 15489 ) of girls reported that they engaged in appropriate wcb  and 4.2% of boys ( n = 1466 ) and 9.6% of girls ( n = 3324 ) reported that they engaged in inappropriate wcb . 
 boys who had engaged in inappropriate wcb were more likely to report suicide ideation than those not engaging in wcb group ( or  1.57  p < 0.001 ) . 
 girls engaging in inappropriate wcb also had a high suicide ideation rate ( or  1.32  p < 0.001 ) . 
 boys engaging in inappropriate wcb were also more likely to attempt suicide than those not engaging in wcb ( or  2.49  p < 0.001 ) . 
 girls engaging in appropriate wcb ( or  1.21  p = 0.02 ) or inappropriate wcb ( or  1.92  p < 
 0.001 ) were more likely to attempt suicide than girls not engaging in wcb at all  and the association was stronger among the latter comparison group . 
 the association between suicidal behavior and wcb stratified by bmi  bwp  and bsm is shown in table 3 . 
 boys with an underweight bmi and that engaged in inappropriate wcb experienced the highest rate of suicide ideation ( or  2.22  p < 0.05 ) compared to other bmi groups . 
 girls with an underweight bmi and that engaged in inappropriate wcb were 4.53 times more likely to attempt suicide than girls who did not engage in wcb . 
 girls who perceived their weight as normal and engaged in inappropriate wcb were more likely to experience suicide ideation ( or  1.50  p < 0.001 ) and attempt ( or  2.31  p < 0.001 ) than girls who did not engage in wcb . 
 considering bsm  boys who distorted their body shape and who engaged in inappropriate wcb were more likely to experience suicide ideation ( underestimate : or  1.44  p < 0.01  overestimate : or  1.91  p < 0.01 ) and attempt ( underestimate : or  1.96  p < 0.01  overestimate : or  2.94  p < 0.01 ) than boys who do not engaged in wcb . girls who underestimated or overestimated their body shape and engaged in inappropriate wcb showed significant association with suicide attempt ( underestimate : or  1.89  p < 0.001  overestimate : or  1.73  p < 0.001 ) compared to girls who do not engaged in wcb . 
 adjusted for age  sex  household economic status  parents presence  residential area  school level  academic achievement  subjective health status  sleep satisfaction  physical activity  current alcohol consumption  current smoker  stress status  and depression . can not be calculated due to the lack of number . 
 table 4 lists the odds ratios of the top five wcb combinations engaged in by korean adolescents and their association with suicide behaviors . conducting regular exercise and eating less together with fasting 
 was significantly associated with suicidal ideation ( boys : or  1.70  p < 0.01  girls : or  1.33  p < 0.05 ) and attempt ( boys : or  1.84  p 
 < 0.05  girls : or  2.24  p < 0.001 ) among both boys and girls  and girls had higher rates of attempted suicide . adjusted for age  sex  household economic status  parents presence  residential area  school level  academic achievement  subjective health status  sleep satisfaction  physical activity  current alcohol consumption  current smoker  stress status  and depression . 
 in the present study  we investigated association between inappropriate wcb and suicide ideation and attempt by korean adolescent by using nationally represented data . 
 inappropriate wcb was significantly associated with suicidal behaviors in both boys and girls  and with a higher rate in boys . 
 our study findings of a higher likelihood of suicidal behaviors among adolescents engaging in wcb ( especially inappropriate wcb )  confirm results described in previous studies . 
 adolescents using inappropriate methods to control weight are highly likely to experience psychological symptoms including anxiety  fatigue  and impaired concentration ( 26 ) . additionally  there is a prospective association between wcb and depression ( 27 ) . 
 depression in adolescence is a serious public health concern due to the increased risk of suicide among depressed youth ( 28 ) . 
 moreover  wcb can cause eating disorders  with fasting an especially high risk factor for development of eating disorders ( 29 ) . 
 another study among adolescents and with a 5 year follow up reported that unhealthy wcb were the most powerful predictors of eating disorders ( 18 ) . eating disorders have adverse consequences on adolescents ' physical and mental health ( 30 )  and can cause suicide ideation and attempt ( 31 ) . 
 therefore  one possible interpretation of this finding is that wcb represent a risk factor for suicide ideation and attempt by causing depression or eating disorders  both of which have serious consequences on adolescents ' mental health . 
 furthermore  our study demonstrated stronger associations among boys than girls  which is corroborated by other studies ( 623 ) . 
 girls are more sensitive to their weight and easily engage in inappropriate wcb ( 32 )  whereas boys are not as sensitive about their weight and have a lower likelihood of engaging in inappropriate wcb ( 7 ) . 
 therefore  it is possible that boys who consider controlling their weight in inappropriate ways may already be suffering from severe psychological distress due to experiencing immense trauma from teasing or other adverse events . 
 we investigated differences in association between suicide ideation and attempt and wcb by conducting subgroup analyses using bmi  bwp  and bsm . in the context of bmi  underweight boys engaged in inappropriate wcb experienced the highest rate of suicide ideation and attempt than other bmi groups  and underweight girls were considerably more likely to attempt suicide . 
 additionally  suicidal behavior was also associated with boys and girls of a normal weight engaged in inappropriate wcb . 
 this suggests that adolescents who do not need to control their weight but engage in unnecessary wcb nonetheless are at higher risk for experienced adverse consequences ( 12 ) . with regards to bsm 
  the results of this study showed that misperception of body shape is also associated with suicide ideation and attempt . 
 the media continues to portray slender bodies for girls and muscular bodies for boys as ideal body shapes  and this could have an effect on body shape misperception among adolescents ( 33 ) . 
 this mismatch contributes to adolescent depression  which in turn increases the risk of suicide among youth ( 34 ) . 
 moreover  this mismatch could be related to adolescents ' unnecessary weight control behaviors to obtain the ideal body shape . 
 eventually  the effect of inappropriate wcb aggravates adverse effects from a distorted body image  and it seems that this psychological burden causes adolescents to think about or attempt suicide . 
 we also extracted the five most common combinations of weight control methods used by korean adolescents and investigated the association between these wcb and suicidal behaviors . only conducting 
 regular exercise was the most frequent wcb among boys and the third most common among girls . 
 however  this combination was not significantly associated with suicidal behaviors in boys or girls . 
 the most common wcb engaged in by girls was ' regular exercise and eating less '  and it also did not show any significant association with suicidal behaviors . 
 interestingly  both boys and girls engaging in ' regular exercise  fasting  and eating less ' were more likely to experience suicidal behaviors compared to those who did not conduct any wcb . 
 although regular exercise and eating less are both appropriate wcbs  when fasting  which is classified as an inappropriate wcb  is added  this combination could contribute to adolescents ' suicidal behaviors . according to a previous study  
 fasting for weight control showed an association with depression when compared with other wcbs ( 35 ) . in practice  fasting causes the blood glucose concentration to fall below normal  and this status releases the hormone cortisol  which is associated with anxiety and negative feelings ( 36 ) . 
 therefore  it seems that this combination influences suicidal behaviors due to the strong influence of fasting on depressive symptoms . 
 this study was designed as cross - sectional study ; therefore  we could not exclude the potential bi - directional effect . 
 in addition  the time frames of wcb ( within the past 30 days ) and suicide ideation and attempt ( within the past 12 months ) differed . 
 therefore  a reverse - time order could not be clearly excluded ( 6 ) . 
 moreover  responses from the kyrbs represent self - reported data  and therefore may be inaccurate . 
 additionally  we could not obtain detailed descriptions of each wcb including frequency or amount . 
 however  despite the limitations  this study can be generalized by using nationally representative data . 
 additionally  compared to previous studies that only reported associations between wcb and suicidal behavior  we further investigated differences in this association in the context of bmi  bwp  and bsm . moreover  this is the first study to investigate common wcb combinations and to determine the association between the top five such combinations and suicide ideation and attempt . considering that the high incidence of suicide and the severe negative impact of adolescents ' inappropriate wcb on their health  our findings represent an important motivation for health policy makers to identify solutions for controlling adolescents ' suicide problem . 
 inappropriate wcb among adolescents is a serious public health concern considering its widespread prevalence and harmful influence on growth  physical health  and psychosocial growth . 
 additionally  as shown here  wcb can be associated with health compromising behaviors including suicide ideation and attempt . 
 therefore  to protect adolescents ' healthy psychological status in the context of weight concerns  policy makers and health professionals must endeavor to correct the distorted body perception experienced by adolescents . 
 additionally  they should help adolescents develop skills for avoiding inappropriate wcb  and encourage appropriate methods of weight control such as physical activity  fruit and vegetable consumption  and the avoidance of fatty and sweet foods . 
 future studies should be designed regardless of gender or weight status because boys and normal or underweight adolescents are currently low priority even though they are also at risk for adverse effects due to wcb according to the present study . 
 therefore  broader viewpoints and approaches are needed when considering adolescents ' weight - related behaviors .","

1) Abstract: This study examined the association between weight control behaviors (WCB) and suicide ideation and attempts among adolescents in Korea. Data from the 2014 Youth Risk Behavior Survey was used to classify participants into appropriate WCB, inappropriate WCB, and no WCB groups. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the data.
2) Research and Discussion: The results showed that both boys and girls with inappropriate WCB were more likely to report suicide ideation and attempts. Underweight and normal weight boys and underweight girls with inappropriate WCB were particularly at risk. The combination of ""regular exercise, fasting, eating less"" was highly associated with suicide ideation and attempts.
3) Results and Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of promoting healthy ways of weight control among adolescents in Korea, given the high incidence of suicide among this age group and the negative effects of inappropriate WCB. Future research should focus on intervention strategies to help adolescents maintain a healthy body weight and prevent suicide ideation and attempts. "
"in the past 15 years  green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) has changed from a nearly unknown protein to a commonly used molecular imaging tool in biology  chemistry  genetics  and medicine . in 2006  more than 10  000 papers 
 gfps and gfp - like proteins ( i.e.  chromoproteins and fluorescent proteins ) are particularly useful due to their stability and the fact that the chromophore ( see figure 1 ) is formed in an autocatalytic cyclization of the 65syg67 sequence that does not require a cofactor . 
 this means that unlike most other bioluminescent reporters  gfp fluoresces in the absence of any other proteins  substrates  or cofactors . 
 furthermore  it appears that fusion of gfp to a protein does not alter the function or location of the protein . by changing residue 66 and/or the amino acid residues around the chromophore 
 (n1c1c2c3 ) and (c1c2c3c4 ) dihedral angles of the gfp chromophore . in the protein  
 r1 is gly67 and r2 is ser65  and in hbdi  an often - used model compound  r1 = r2 = ch3 . in  one - bond flips ( -obf ) the dihedral rotation occurs around the  torsional angle  in a -obf it is around the  dihedral angle  and in a positively correlated hula - twist ( + ht ) the  and  dihedral angles concertedly rotate in the same direction ( as shown above )  while in a negatively correlated hula twist ( ht ) they concertedly rotate in opposite directions . a plot of the  and  dihedrals for a perfectly correlated negative ht will have a slope of 1 . 
 if the chromophore cavity is complementary with a planar chromophore  then the  and  best fit line will pass through the origin and all the  and  angles will be centered around the origin . 
 a nonzero intercept along the  or  axis ( see  for example  figure 4 ) or  and  dihedrals centered in quadrant ii (  > 0 ; 
 < 0 ) or quadrant iv (  < 0 ;  > 0 ; see  for example  figure 8) are indications of a cavity that is not complementary with a planar chromophore . the fluorescent emission of the chromophore within gfp occurs with high efficiency ( quantum yield fl = 0.8 ) and a respectable fluorescence lifetime (   3 ns).(19 ) when the protein is denatured the fluorescence yield decreases by at least 3 orders of magnitude.(20 ) model compounds of the chromophore do not fluoresce in solution ( quantum yield fl < 10 )  unless the rotation of the arylalkene bond is restrained.(21 ) fluorescence can  however  be obtained by lowering the temperature to 77 k ; this freezes the solution . 
 it has been suggested that twisting between the phenolate and imadazolidinone groups of the chromophore is the mechanism for the ultrafast fluorescence quenching internal conversion process . 
 neutral form ( a ) of the chromophore  with the phenolic oxygen protonated  can convert to the anionic species ( b ) by going through an intermediate state ( i ) . 
 the change from forms a to i is solely a protonation change  while the change from i to b is a conformational change with most changes occurring at thr203 . 
 upon excitation of the a state  an excited - state proton transfer ( espt ) occurs in which the proton is transferred from the chromophore to glu222 in a time scale of the order of picoseconds . following radiative relaxation from the excited - state intermediate ( i * )  
 the systems returns to the ground state a through the ground - state intermediates i1 and i2.(29 ) excitation of the anionic b state results in direct emission from the excited state ( b * ) at 482 nm . recently 
  a nonfluorescent dark state  state c  has been observed that is distinct from states a and b and absorbs at higher energies.(30 ) the c state  perhaps the neutral trans form of the chromophore  may be populated by nonradiative decay from a * and it may be depopulated by excitation to the excited c * state with transcis isomerization to repopulate state a. fluorescent blinking has been ascribed to nonadiabatic crossing and conversions between the neutral and anionic states(31 ) or a possible dark ( z ) zwitterionic state . while the ground - state minimum of the gfp chromophore is close to planar  this is not necessarily so for the excited state ; in fact  in some cases the excited state has an energy minimum with a twisted chromophore in which both rings are 90 to each other.(32 ) according to quantum mechanical calculations  the ground and excited states for the  one - bond flip ( obf ) and hula twist ( ht ) in the neutral form ( a ) and the  obf in the zwitterionic form come very close to each other . 
 it has been proposed that in the absence of the protein matrix  which surrounds the chromophore and prevents twisting  this process can lead to fluorescence quenching internal crossing;(32 ) see figure 3 . 
 recent calculations on the gfp chromophore model compound hbdi suggest that the anionic form of hbdi may also undergo a -obf that leads to a favored radiationless decay channel  which is particularly efficient in solvent.(34 ) ( a ) model compounds of the gfp chromophore in the ground state ( s0 ) can be excited to the first singlet state ( s1 ) in which a ht or obf can freely occur . upon reaching the perpendicularly twisted conformation  fluorescence quenching nac ( nonadiabatic crossing ) occurs . 
 ( b ) in the ground state ( s0 )  the residues surrounding the gfp chromophore exert a twisting force on the chromophore (  ) . upon excitation  the conjugation across the ethylenic bridge of the chromophore is reduced and it will twist ; however  the protein matrix prevents the chromophore from reaching the perpendicularly twisted conformation (  ) and fluorescence quenching internal crossing is prevented . 
 recently  the results from a number of interesting experiments that provide evidence for chromophore twisting and/or fluorescence quenching internal crossing ( ic ) have been published . 
 for example  a molecular dynamics simulation of the chromophore of cyan fluorescent protein found that the average  dihedral angle was about 0 ; however  when the surrounding protein was considered in the simulation the average shifted by approximately 5  showing that the protein matrix of cfp twists the chromophore . on the basis of their calculations  the authors concluded that  the driving force for this twist comes from the strong short - range repulsion by four residues ( ile167  val150  phe165  and thr203 ) surrounding the average position of the chromophore.(46 ) photoswitching fluorescent proteins can be switched back and forth between the naturally occurring green state and a dark state by 405 nm irradiation ( e.g.  dronpa  mtfp0.7  kfp1 ) . 
 a cistrans isomerization of the chromophore has been proposed as the structural basis for the photoswitching observed in dronpa.(47 ) this is supported by the fact that mutating either val157 or met159 with smaller residues accelerates photoswitching  presumably by decreasing steric hindrance to cistrans isomerization.(48 ) 
 the m159 t and v157 g mutations also decrease the quantum yield of dronpa from 0.85 to quantum yields of 0.23 and 0.77  respectively.(48 ) recently  it has been suggested that adoption of a trans configuration can not solely be responsible for the nonfluorescent form.(49 ) on the basis of nmr analyses  miyawaki et al . 
 propose that  the fluorescence of the protein is regulated by the degree of flexibility of the chromophore but is not necessarily accompanied by cistrans isomerization.(49 ) interestingly  gfp is not unique  in photoactive yellow protein ( pyp ) the protein matrix also prevents the chromophore from adopting a completely planar structure . in pyp 
 the asymmetric proteinchromophore interaction probably serves as the initial accelerant for the light induced photocycle(50 ) which ultimately leads to a cistrans isomerization.(51 ) the chromophore in wild - type gfp is planar due its extended  system ( see figure 1 ) ; however  the energy barrier to deformation is low and the protein matrix in wild - type gfp exerts some strain away from planarity . 
 when the chromophore is computationally permitted to freely rotate  it will adopt a conformation that complements the protein matrix . 
 recently  we have used computational methods to show that wild - type gfp is not an anomaly and that all gfp and gfp - like proteins in the protein databank have a protein matrix that is not complementary with a planar chromophore.(54 ) in most cases the freely rotating chromophore undergoes  rotations of at least 20. in some cases these rotations are accompanied by an equal but opposite rotation of the  dihedral angle ( a negatively correlated ht ) . 
 none of the proteins examined have a cavity that causes a rotation solely around the  dihedral angle.(54 ) these calculations were done by minimizing  with freely rotating  and  dihedral angles  the crystal structure of 38 gfp analogues and mutants found in the pdb . 
 they found the energy minimum conformation of a freely rotating chromophore in the protein matrix of the gfp mutant or gfp - like protein examined ; however  they did not provide any information about the range of low - energy conformations available to a freely rotating chromophore . to get this information 
  we ran molecular dynamics simulations of some of the interesting gfp mutants in the protein databank.(56 ) by running molecular dynamics simulations  with freely rotating  and  dihedrals  we have been able to determine the range of conformations available to chromophores with complete rotational freedom . 
 the coordinates of three crystal structures ( 1gfl(57 ) 1myw(58 ) 2emd(59 ) ) were obtained from the protein data bank ( pdb)(56 ) and hydrogen atoms were added to protein and solvent atoms as required . the opls_2005 force field of macromodel v9.0016(60 ) was used . 
 starting structures for mutants for which no crystal structure has been determined were calculated by graphically mutating a known structure and undertaking a conformational search . 
 the flexible dihedral angles of all the side chains of residues that are within 8.00  of the chromophore were randomly rotated by between 0 and 180  and all solvent molecules in that sphere were randomly rotated and translated by between 0 and 1.00  in each monte carlo ( mc ) step.(63 ) 15  000 mc steps were taken in each search . 
 structures within 50 kj / mol of the lowest energy minimum were kept and a usage - directed method(62 ) was used to select structures for subsequent mc steps . 
 structures found in the conformational search were considered unique if the least - squared superimposition of equivalent non - hydrogen atoms found one or more pairs separated by 0.25  or more . the lowest energy structure obtained in the monte carlo torsional and molecular position variation search 
 the final structures obtained from the mc search ( monte carlo torsional and molecular position variation and large - scale low mode ) or fully minimized pdb structures were used to initiate md simulations with freely rotating  and  dihedral angles ( v1 = v2 = v3 = 0.000 ) . 
 the predynamics simulation was set for 100 ps and the full md simulation for 5000 ps . 
 the cambridge structure database ( csd ) v5.29 was released in january 2008 ; it comprises 436  384 small molecule crystal structures . 
 the area of the convex hull of the  and  graphs was calculated as was the smallest convex set containing the region . 
 molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations have been used to examine the steric environment of the chromophore in gfp in its ground state . 
 they are techniques that are based on classical physics and were designed to model structural and not electronic properties ; therefore  molecular mechanics and dynamics simulations of gfp can not examine the excited state of the chromophore . 
 quantum calculations are an excellent technique to determine the energy profiles of the ground and excited states of the chromophore ; however  they are cpu - intensive and it would be cost prohibitive to do conformational searches on the excited state of a series of gfp and gfp - like proteins . 
 therefore  in an attempt to supplement the quantum calculations  we have examined the conformational space available to the chromophore within gfp using a freely rotating chromophore that is an approximation ( based on qm calculations ) of the conformational space available to the chromophore in its excited state . as shown in figure 2  
 gfp adopts two states  the neutral state ( a ) of the chromophore with the phenolic oxygen protonated  and the anionic species ( b ) 
 the change from forms a to i is solely a protonation change  while the change from i to b is a conformational change with most changes occurring at thr203.(67 ) in order to see whether the gfp chromophore has different dihedral freedom in forms a  b  and i  we conducted molecular dynamical simulations with a freely rotating chromophore  as described in the . 
 not surprisingly  table 1 and figure 4 show that forms a  b  and i of gfp have similar dihedral freedom and that all undergo similar negatively correlated ( same slopes of best fit lines in figure 4 ) hula twists . 
 plot of the  vs  dihedral angles ( see figure 1 for nomenclature ) for the 2000 gfp - a ( pink )  gfp - b ( green )  and gfp - i ( light - blue ) structures obtained in the freely rotating molecular dynamics simulation . however  there are subtle differences ; forms a and i are closer to the planar ground - state conformation  while the b form adopts conformations further from planarity when given rotational freedom around the  and  dihedrals ( intercept further from  = 0 ) ; and the anionic b form has the most freedom ( largest area  and  and  range )  while the neutral a form has the least freedom . 
 the a form has robust hydrogen bonds between both arg96 and gln94 and the imidazolidinone carbonyl group that remain intact throughout the simulations . in the intermediate ( i ) 
 form these hydrogen bonds are supplemented by an additional hydrogen bond between the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore and his148 ( see table 2 ) . 
 the main difference between the anionic b form and the intermediate form is that thr203 has to rotate in order to hydrogen bond to the phenolic oxygen in form i  otherwise they have the same hydrogen - bonding interactions throughout the simulation . 
 the y66h mutant of gfp exhibits blue fluorescence and has therefore been termed blue fluorescent protein . 
 the crystal structure of bfp ( not to be confused with blue fluorescent protein from aequorin bfp - aq(68 ) ) has been solved at ph 4.5(27 ) and ph 8.5;(59 ) the overall fold of the protein is identical to wild - type gfp and consists of a chromophore surrounded by an 11-stranded -barrel . 
 while gfp has absorption maxima at 395 and 475 nm and emits at 508 nm  bfp absorbs at 382 nm and emits at 448 nm.(9 ) unfolding of bfp results in an absorption red shift of 15 nm(27 ) and quantum mechanical calculations suggest that the 15 nm shift might be due to the protein - induced nonplanarity of the chromophore.(69 ) blue fluorescent protein ( bfp ) has a much lower fluorescence quantum yield than gfp ( fl = 0.20 vs 0.80 ) . 
 it has been suggested that this is due to the fact that his66 ( bfp - chromophore ) forms fewer hydrogen bonds with the surrounding protein than tyr66 ( gfp - chromophore ) does  and that the smaller imadazole ring ( his66 ) in bfp may have more conformational freedom than the larger phenol ( tyr66 )  which leads to more intersystem crossing.(27 ) in a very elegant series of experiments  boxer et al . 
 have shown that the fluorescence quantum yield of blue fluorescent protein increases from fl = 0.20 to 0.35 when the pressure is increased from atmospheric pressure to 570 mpa.(70 )  analysis of the fluorescence lifetimes in the picosecond and nanosecond regimes reveals that the enhancement of the fluorescence quantum yield is due to the inhibition of fast quenching processes . 
 temperature - dependent fluorescence measurements reveal two barriers ( 19 and 3 kj / mol  respectively ) for the transition into nonfluorescing states . 
 these steps are probably linked with dissociation of the hydrogen bond between the chromophore and his148 or an intervening water molecule and to the barrier for chromophore twisting in the excited state  respectively.(70 ) in order to establish the consequences of the y66h mutation on the flexibility of the chromophore  molecular dynamics simulations of the ph 8.5 bfp crystal structure ( pdb code 2emd with neutral imidazole rings for his66 and his148 ) with a freely rotating chromophore were run . 
 [ we thank one of the referees for suggesting the ph 8.5 ( 2emd ) over the ph 4.5 ( 1bfp ) structure . 
 ] figure 5 and table 1 show that the chromophore in bfp has significantly more rotational freedom than that available to the chromophore in gfp  and that the bfp cavity is less complementary to a planar chromophore than the gfp cavity is ; that is  the bfp sampled structures are further from a planar chromophore (  =  = 0 ) and the intercept for the best fit line through the bfp structures is further from the origin than that of gfp . 
 plot of the  vs  dihedral angles for the 2000 bfp ( blue ) and gfp - a ( green ) structures obtained in the freely rotating molecular dynamics simulation . 
 analysis of the 2000 bfp structures revealed a hydrogen bond between the nh of the his66 imidazole ring and glu222  which is retained through - out the entire simulation ( see figure 7 ) . 
 the smaller imadazole ring of the bfp chromophore results in more dihedral freedom for the chromophore in bfp than phenol in gfp ; however  there seems to be no large difference in the number and stability of hydrogen bonds formed by the chromophore in the two fps . 
 recently  two new blue fluorescent proteins ( azurite and a5 ) with enhanced brightness and photostability were created . 
 the methodology applied to find the brighter bfp mutants was based on the concept that replacing the residues surrounding the chromophore with bulkier amino acids would constrain the chromophore s motion and thereby increase the proteins brightness . 
 the crystal structure of a5 has yet to be solved . in order to find a starting conformation for the md simulation  the 2emd crystal structure 
 was graphically mutated to a5 and a thorough conformational search was undertaken ( see ) . 
 given the high structural similarity between all the solid state structures of gfp mutants in the protein databank  a thorough conformational search should find the lowest energy conformations of a5 by making the relevant mutations to the 2emd structure . 
 figure 6 and table 1 show that the conformational space available to the chromophore in bfp is larger than that in a5 and that the bfp conformations tend to be further from planarity ; i.e.  for a5 median = 2.92  median = 2.22 and intercept of best - fit line is 4.62 vs for bfp median = 27.59  median = 10.18 and intercept of best - fit line 14.27 . 
 similar results were found for md simulations carried out from all of the five lowest energy conformational families sampled in the conformational search of a5 and in a md simulation initiated from an a5 structure obtained by taking the 2emd structure  graphically mutating it to a5  and thoroughly minimizing the structure without undertaking a conformational search .

 the n of the his66 imidazole ring hydrogen bonds with water305 ( 2emd numbering ) in all the sampled structures . 
 this water connects his66 to the surface of the protein via a robust hydrogen - bonding network to his148 and is also hydrogen bonded to glu222 . in half the structures sampled  the n of the his66 imidazole ring hydrogen bonds to water302 which is in an extensive hydrogen - bonding network with val68  arg224  and gln69 . 
 in contrast to 2emd there are no hydrogen - bonding interactions with the n hydrogen ; see figure 7 . 
 hydrogen - bonding interactions ( --- ) for 2emd ( top ) and a5 ( bottom ) chromophore . 
 these results seem to indicate that the enhanced brightness of a5 is at least in part due to the fact that its chromophore movement is restricted relative to bfp . 
 this restriction can be due to both steric factors and the increased hydrogen - bonding networks in a5 . in the first rationally designed mutant based on the crystal structure of gfp - s65 t  
 it was decided to mutate t203 into a tyrosine so that it could  stack with the phenolic group in the chromophore . 
 ( 73 ) the resultant mutant  yfp  is red - shifted by 16 nm relative to gfp - s65 t and does indeed have a  stacking interaction between the chromophore and tyr203.(74 ) on the basis of the crystal structure of yfp  remington et al . 
 proposed that the red shift was due to the additional polarizability of the -stacked tyr203  the hydrogen - bond pattern around the chromophore  or an out - of - plane distortion of the chromophore ( in analogy with out - of - plane distortions in porphyrin systems).(74 ) comparison with the t203v mutant revealed that the t203y substitution leads to a significant i - form population and only about 10 nm of the shift can be ascribed to the  interaction.(75 ) a new varient of yfp  venus  with improved brightness and maturation properties as well as a reduced environmental sensitivity was developed and crystallized.(58 ) since some researchers have argued that the presence of tyr203 leads to a decrease in chromophore flexibility ( van der waals volume for tyr = 141  vs 93  for thr )  and others argue that this is not necessarily so(32 ) we have examined the conformational space available to a freely rotating chromophore in yfp ( pdb code 1myw ) with the phenol of tyr66 in both the protonated and unprotonated forms . both table 1 and figure 8 
 show that the chromophore ( in the phenolic form ) in gfp and yfp has differing rotational freedom . in yfp 
 the chromophore has approximately 1.2 times more dihedral freedom than in gfp and although the dihedrals undergo negatively correlated hula - twisting in both proteins  in yfp the average conformation sampled is further from planarity than that found in gfp ; i.e.  the majority of the sampled conformations are located in quadrant iv . 
 plot of the  vs  dihedral angles ( see figure 1 for nomenclature ) for the 2000 structures obtained in the freely rotating molecular dynamics simulation of gfp ( dark blue ) and yfp ( pink ) in their phenolic forms . 
 the majority of the yfp conformations sampled are nonplanar ( i.e.  in quadrant iv  < 0 and  > 0 ) . during the entire simulation the hydrogen bonds between tyr66 and ser205  arg96 and the imidazolone carbonyl  as well as between tyr203 and water354 remain stable  while those between tyr203 and gln69 were less stable . 
 we also examined the distance between the centroid of tyr66 ( the choromophore ) and tyr203 . 
 the distance is fairly short and does not change much during the simulation ( minimum = 3.43   maximum = 4.18   average = 3.75   sd = 0.103  ) while the angle between the planes of the phenols varies between 0.0 and 22.5 ( average = 6.9  sd = 4.11 ) . 
 the short distance between the phenol rings is indicative of  stacking  which may be responsible for the red shift observed in yfp ; however  the variability in the angle between the planes of the phenols shows that tyr203 does not significantly restrict the rotational freedom of the excited chromophore . 
 the cambridge structural database ( csd)(77 ) v5.29 comprises 436  384 small molecules crystal structures . 
 it has 5551 structures with two phenol rings in separate molecules that have centroids within 5.00  of each other . 
 the closest ones are 3.16  from each other  and only 832 structures are within 3.75  ; i.e.  the average distance between the phenol centroids in the freely rotating yfp . 
 a plot of the distance vs the angle between the phenol planes in our freely rotating simulation and the csd structures shows that the protein matrix of yfp restricts the distance between tyr66 and tyr203 from being larger than 4.18   but that the angles between the two phenols have as much freedom in yfp as in the small molecule structures with intermolecular distances of less than 4.18  ( see figure 9 ) . 
 it does not seem as if the increased fluorescence lifetime of yfp is due to a decrease in the dihedral freedom of the chromophore . 
 it is more likely due to electronic effects such as those proposed by jung et al.(78 ) they suggested that the anionic form of the chromophore can be described by two mesomeric forms  the benzoidal and the quinoidal structure . 
 the benzoidal form with the majority of its negative charge on the phenol is stabilized by hydrogen bonding to thr203  which is not possible in yfp and therefore the t203y mutation favors the quinoidal form  which may have a longer fluorescence lifetime.(78 ) distance vs angle between the phenol planes in yfp (  ) and all structures in the csd that have two unconnected phenols separated by less than 5.00  ( + ) . 
 some have suggested that the crystal structures of strongly fluorescent gfp and gfp - like proteins have their chromophores in a cis configuration  while those of the nonfluorescent proteins are in a trans configuration . 
 however  the trans - planar form of eqfp611 is an important exception : it is fluorescent.(82 ) remington et al . 
 have suggested that coplanarity might be more important than isomer configuration in determining the efficiency of fluorescence . 
 most current theories ( see ) suggest that a restriction in the rotational freedom of the fluorescent protein chromophore will lead to an increase in fluorescence brightness and/or quantum yield . 
 our calculations show that this is the case for the systems examined . for bfp  a5  yfp  and gfp 
  there is an inverse correlation between the dihedral freedom of the chromophore and the quantum yield ; see table 1 . in all simulations  
 the protein matrix is not complementary with a planar chromophore  and in all cases the freely rotating chromophore undergoes a negatively correlated hula twist ( also known as a bottom hula twist mechanism ) .","

1) Abstract:
Quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the dihedral freedom of chromophore model systems in green fluorescent proteins. The simulations suggest that rotational restrictions in the chromophore may decrease fluorescence brightness and quantum yield.

2) Research and Discussion:
Previous theories suggest that limiting the rotational freedom of the fluorescent protein chromophore would increase fluorescence properties. Our calculations and simulations showed a negative correlation between dihedral freedom and quantum yield, with gfp having the least dihedral freedom and the highest quantum yield.

3) Results and Conclusion:
The results of our study support the idea that a decrease in dihedral freedom can greatly impact the fluorescence properties of GFP and GFP-like proteins. Further research should focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms that control dihedral freedom and its effect on fluorescence. These findings have significant implications in the development and optimization of fluorescent proteins for various applications."
"fnas represent an advantageous  effective means to obtain diagnostic cellular material as they can often sample a wide area of the target lesion  acquire tumor cells with lower contamination by background stromal connective tissue elements  and allow for immediate assessment during rapid on - site evaluation ( rose ) . during the on - site assessment  
 a member of the cytopathology team is present and prepares direct smears  using the contents expelled from the needle  at the location of the procedure . 
 this is advantageous for three reasons : each needle pass can be examined to determine tumor cell adequacy ; there is an opportunity to engage the clinical care provider in a conversation regarding the preliminary diagnosis and relevant molecular diagnostic tests ; and the cytopathology team member can help ensure that the specimen is processed in a manner that optimizes judicious triage for ancillary tests  including molecular studies . 
 fnas can be performed without rose and in this setting  the contents of the fna needles are typically expelled and rinsed in a cell preservative solution for use in liquid - based cytology ( lbc ) preparations . 
 examples of lbc preparations include thinprep ( hologic  bedford  ma  usa )  surepath ( becton dickinson  franklin lakes  nj  usa )  thin - layer advanced cytology assay system ( tacas  mbl  tokyo  japan )  and liqui - prep ( lgm international inc .  
 nonetheless  rose is an effective means to maximize the chances of success in acquiring adequate tumor cells for diagnosis and anticipated molecular studies . 
 the ultimate goal is to prevent unnecessary repeat procedures to obtain additional tissue just for molecular studies which can lead to delays in treatment . for patients afflicted with lung cancer at our institution  
 we perform rose for cytopathologist - performed fnas and for ebus - guided fnas  performed by our clinical colleagues . 
 the contents of each needle pass are expelled onto a slide which is utilized to prepare direct smears . 
 the needle is then rinsed into buffered media ; we utilize rpmi media for this purpose . 
 commonly  a pair of direct smears is prepared per needle pass ; one is air - dried and the other is immediately alcohol - fixed . 
 the air - dried smear is stained on - site with the diff - quik ( romanowsky ) stain and the stained slide can be examined under the microscope immediately thereafter . 
 the alcohol - fixed smear is stained later in the cytopathology laboratory with the papanicolaou stain . 
 alternatively  the needle contents can be distributed over multiple smears allowing for flexibility in the utilization of direct smears for cytomorphologic evaluation and ancillary studies ( fig . 
 based on the findings in the diff - quik stained smears  the determination can be made to perform additional needle passes to obtain more tumor cells for diagnosis and/or anticipated ancillary studies while the patient is still accessible . 
 for instance  additional direct smears can be prepared and/or dedicated needle passes for the rinse solution ( i.e.  the needle contents are rinsed in the rpmi solution without the preparation of smears for those needle passes ) obtained for the cell block preparation . 
 this overall approach is flexible  forgiving  and engages the cytopathology team in maximizing the chance of success in obtaining adequate cellular material for diagnosis and ancillary studies . 
 this approach can help minimize the chances of encountering the scenario in which diagnostic cellular material is present on only one smear ; microdissection of the cells for molecular studies can result in sacrificing this only diagnostic slide in this context  which can have medico - legal consequences . 
 if this scenario is encountered  however  this risk can be mitigated by digital archiving prior to microdissection either via digital slide scanning and/or obtaining photomicrographs . 
 after immediate assessment of the cytomorphologic findings on the diff - quik stained smears  a preliminary diagnosis can be rendered by the cytopathologist and communicated to the clinical care providers . 
 after the conclusion of the procedure  the needle rinse solution  containing a suspension of aspirated cells  is centrifuged in the cytopathology laboratory to pellet the cells . 
 once the supernatant is removed  the cell pellet is congealed in a matrix ; an agar - like substance such as histogel ( thermo scientific  waltham  ma  usa ) can be used or the cells can be mixed with plasma and thrombin to create a clot . at our institution  we employ histogel for this purpose . 
 commonly  this cassette is fixed in formalin and processed to ultimately create a formalin - fixed  paraffin - embedded ( ffpe ) cell block . 
 this is analogous to a ffpe block of small biopsy tissue  which can be sectioned for evaluation via the hematoxylin and eosin stain and ancillary tests such as immunocytochemistry or molecular diagnostic assays . 
 it should be noted that heavy metal fixatives such as zenker s fixative and acidzinc - formalin  acidic fixatives such as bouin s solution  or decalcification solutions should generally be avoided as these render specimens unusable for molecular testing . 
 the main advantage of using cell blocks is that the majority of ancillary tests are validated for ffpe sections ; ffpe cell blocks are treated similarly to traditional surgical pathology ffpe blocks . 
 furthermore  multiple serial sections from cell blocks can be utilized to perform a battery of ancillary studies . 
 first  adequate cellularity in cell blocks is not guaranteed at the time of the procedure . 
 performing dedicated needle passes  for the needle rinse solution during the fna procedure  may improve the chances of obtaining a sufficiently cellular cell block but still does not guarantee success . 
 in addition  for hypocellular cell blocks  there is a risk of depleting the cells of interest upon deeper sectioning for molecular tests . 
 second  the cell block is derived from a needle rinse solution which is a pooled specimen that contains contents of all the needle passes . 
 thus  if one or more needle passes contain tumor cells but other needle passes contain abundant benign background cellular elements  the tumor cells will be diluted by these benign cells in the cell block . 
 in addition to the above disadvantages  dna extracted from ffpe cell blocks may produce sequencing artifacts as formalin fixation leads to the crosslinking of nucleic acids and proteins and the possibility of sequence alterations . 
 recently  given the shortcomings of cell blocks  there has been an increasing appreciation of alternative cytopreparatory platforms for molecular testing such as direct smears and lbc samples . in the subsequent sections below  
 the utilization of these cytopreparatory platforms will be discussed in the context of the clinically relevant mutations and translocations analyzed during molecular diagnostic testing of nsclcs . 
 the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) gene encodes a transmembrane growth factor receptor that exhibits tyrosine kinase activity . upon activation  
 intracellular signaling is mediated by cytoplasmic effectors in the ras - raf - mek - erk  pi3k - akt  and stat pathways . 
 egfr mutations are predominantly observed in lung adenocarcinomas ; the l858r substitution and small in - frame deletions in exon 19 are the most commonly observed mutations and account for up to 90% of all egfr mutations in this setting . 
 these mutations are more commonly associated with east asian ethnicity  female gender  and non - smoking history . 
 however  these are not absolute rules and clinical characteristics should not be used to exclude lung cancer patients from mutation testing . 
 lung adenocarcinomas harboring these sensitizing mutations in egfr have been shown to respond to egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tkis ) . 
  tki therapy has been demonstrated to result in improved progression - free survival  compared to standard chemotherapy  for patients with lung adenocarcinoma harboring egfr mutations [ 11 - 16 ] . 
 egfr mutation analysis is commonly performed via polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and sequencing - based approaches ; advances in the development of testing modalities have afforded a multitude of methodologies . 
 sanger sequencing is considered the gold standard as this involves direct dna sequence acquisition and can provide information regarding the presence of all potential mutations including common  known mutations and novel mutations . 
 nonetheless  this test requires a relatively higher enrichment of tumor cell dna content in the sample . 
 the typical analytic sensitivity for sanger sequencing is 15%20% mutant allele  which equates to 30%40% tumor cells assuming that the genetic mutation is a heterozygous event without amplification . 
 this can be problematic in both small biopsy and cytology specimens  especially cell blocks  in which the tumor cell population can be diluted by background benign cellular elements such as inflammatory cells  bronchial epithelial cells  and/or stromal mesenchymal cells . especially in this 
 setting  a negative mutation result can be either due to the true absence of the mutation in the tumor cells or insufficient percent tumor cellularity that falls below the analytic sensitivity threshold thereby resulting in the failure to detect the mutation even despite the presence of the mutation . 
 therefore  often times  there is more reliance on tumor cell enrichment by either macrodissection or microdissection to obtain a reliable result . 
 sanger sequencing is also relatively more labor intensive and time consuming than targeted methods and can lead to longer turnaround times . 
 in contrast to the general sanger sequencing approach  targeted mutation detection methods such as pcr - restriction fragment length polymorphism  real - time pcr  pyrosequencing  high resolution melting analysis ( hrma )  and pcr fragment analysis can be utilized . 
 the advantages of these approaches include their improved analytic sensitivity and less time - consuming nature leading to reduced turnaround times . at our institution  we utilize a multiplex pcr fragment analysis assay for egfr mutation testing ; this allows for the simultaneous assessment of the two most commonly observed egfr mutations ( fig . 
 2 ) . the analytic sensitivity of this method is better than that of sanger sequencing ; a minimum of only 10% tumor cells is required . in the past decade  
 myriad studies have been reported demonstrating that a variety of cytologic samples and cytopreparatory platforms can be effectively utilized for egfr mutational analysis . 
 these have been reviewed elsewhere   but salient examples will be discussed below . as mentioned previously  
 ffpe cell blocks represent the traditional cytopreparatory platform on which ancillary molecular diagnostic tests are performed . 
 much of the reasoning behind this lies in that ffpe cell blocks best approximate ffpe blocks containing tissue specimens and the majority of the molecular assays are validated using ffpe material . 
 nonetheless  in light of the inherent disadvantages of cell blocks mentioned previously  investigation into other cytopreparatory platforms for molecular diagnostic assays have been performed by our group and many others . 
 cytopathology specimen preparation is diverse and versatile ; the consequence of this is that each type of cytologic analyte platform needs to be carefully validated for any given molecular test . 
 cytologic direct smears may ultimately prove to be the cytologic platform best suited for pcr - based analysis due to the high quality of nucleic acids and immediate nature of specimen assessment for tumor cell adequacy . 
 cells on direct smears are not exposed to formalin but rather undergo an alcohol - based fixation process prior to staining ; thus  the negative effects of formalin fixation on nucleic acid quality is non - contributory for direct smears . 
 furthermore  the tumor cells of interest can be directly visualized on the direct smear and isolated for nucleic acid extraction and molecular analysis ; in essence   what you see is what you get . 
 we have previously demonstrated that uncoverslipped and previously coverslipped / decoverslipped diff - quik stained smears are robust sources of cellular material for pcr - based mutational analysis such as egfr mutation testing of lung adenocarcinoma and braf mutation testing of metastatic melanoma fna specimens . we and others have observed that destaining the smears is not necessary for successful dna extraction and pcr . 
 our preference in utilizing diff - quik stained smears over papanicolaou stained smears is rooted in the following observations : ( 1 ) cellular material on a diff - quik stained smear can be easily visualized without a coverslip and immediately triaged for molecular diagnostic testing ; and ( 2 ) the report by killian et al . 
 that nucleic acids extracted from diff - quik stained smears show better preservation and integrity than dna extracted from papanicolaou stained smears . with respect to the latter point  
 others have pointed out that papanicolaou stained smears are just as feasible for pcr - based molecular tests . 
 multiple groups have successfully demonstrated the utilization of cytologic direct smears for egfr mutation testing of lung adenocarcinomas [ 2925 - 36 ] with low failure rates and high degree of concordance with egfr molecular testing results from corresponding histologic specimens  when available . in our experience  
 100 to 200 tumor cells are sufficient for successful dna isolation and egfr mutation analysis and this is congruent with the observations from others . 
 lbc samples have also been investigated for egfr mutation testing and have been shown to be an effective analyte for this purpose . 
 this is valuable when a member of the cytopathology team is not available for rose . 
 several lbc technologies have been developed including thinprep  surepath  tacas  and liqui - prep . 
 of these  the emerging literature  to date  on the utilization of lbc samples for molecular testing of nsclc have predominantly focused on cytolyt ( cytyc corp .  marlborough  ma  usa ) cell suspensions and thinprep slides . collecting fna samples in the methanol - based cytolyt solution results in reduction of background blood as the cytolyt solution exhibits hemolytic properties . 
 the cell suspension can be divided and an aliquot is used to prepare a thinprep slide that is stained via the papanicolaou method  similar to alcohol - fixed papanicolaou stained direct smears . 
 tumor cells can be isolated from the thinprep slide and used for dna isolation and egfr mutation analysis . 
 furthermore  the cell suspension aliquot that is not used to prepare a thinprep slide can be centrifuged and the cell pellet itself can be used as an analyte for mutation testing [ 38 - 40 ] . 
 similar to the needle rinse cell suspension utilized to prepare cell blocks  the cytolyt cell suspension is a pooled specimen if multiple needle passes are expelled and rinsed into cytolyt . 
 thus  if one or more needle passes are high in tumor cell content whereas other needle passes contain a high proportion of benign cellular elements  the tumor cells in the final pooled cell suspension will be diluted . 
 first  targeted methods for detecting egfr mutations with improved analytic sensitivity  relative to sanger sequencing  can be utilized . 
 second  tumor cell enrichment from the thinprep slide can be accomplished by laser capture microdissection ( lcm ) . to illustrate these points  malapelle et al . 
 directly compared the performance of egfr mutation analysis by sanger sequencing using paired samples for each case analyzed : ( 1 ) pelleted cells from the cytolyt suspension and ( 2 ) tumor cells obtained from the thinprep slide via lcm . 
 they observed that egfr mutations were more reliably identified in the latter rather than the former . 
 this difference was minimized when utilizing more sensitive egfr mutation analytic approaches which included hrma and pcr fragment analysis assays . based on these studies 
  the authors speculated that coupling the use of highly sensitive egfr mutation detection assays and cytolyt derived cell pellets may be sufficient obviating the need for microscopy . 
 nonetheless  it must be emphasized that any negative molecular testing result should carefully be reconciled with the analyte input utilized for the mutation assay . 
 this is essential to determine whether the negative result represents a true negative or potentially a false - negative  necessitating possible retesting . in this regard  
 the utilization of microscopy still remains an essential pre - analytic quality assurance activity to best ensure that the input analyte is of sufficient tumor cellularity to maximize confidence in the results of the mutation assay . of note  a follow - up study by bellevicine et al . 
 they observed that the direct smears exhibited significantly higher cellularity than thinprep slides  on average . 
 accordingly  the average yield of dna extracted from direct smears was significantly higher than that from thinprep slides . as the l858r substitution and deletions in exon 19 represent approximately 90% of all egfr mutations in lung adenocarcinoma  
 one antibody is specific for the exon 21 l858r mutation and the other specific for the 15-base pair/5-amino acid deletion ( e746_a750del ) in exon 19 ( clone 6b6 ) . 
 the immunohistochemical approach to detecting mutant egfr proteins using these antibodies has been examined in several studies on lung cancer tissues as well as cytologic and small biopsy samples [ 42 - 48 ] . 
 the sensitivity of these assays range from 47%92% but their high positive predictive value and specificity supports the feasibility of utilizing this approach as a first - line screening approach . 
 first  immunohistochemistry should be performed after careful validation and formulation of immunostain scoring criteria . 
 the significance of how best to interpret equivocal staining results should be clarified as overinterpreting weak immunoreactivity as a positive mutation result can lead to increased false positives and decreased specificity . 
 second  the clone 6b6 antibody best detects the 15-base pair ( e746_a750del ) egfr deletion mutant protein but demonstrates variable immunoreactivity for the egfr mutant proteins resulting from non-15-base pair deletions in exon 19 . 
 the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( alk ) protein is a receptor tyrosine kinase and rearrangements involving the alk gene locus is observed in approximately 5% of lung adenocarcinomas . 
 these mutations are more commonly observed in younger age patients who are never - smokers . 
 however  there can be exceptions to this and clinical characteristics should not be used to exclude lung cancer patients for alk rearrangement testing . 
 most alk rearrangements in lung adenocarcinoma result from interstitial deletions and small inversions within the short arm of chromosome 2 . 
 this results in the fusion of portions of the echinoderm microtubule - associated protein - like 4 ( eml4 ) and alk genes . 
 other less common alk rearrangements involve fusions between alk and other genes  such as kif5b and tfg . 
 alk rearranged lung adenocarcinoma has been recognized as a legitimate target for small molecular inhibitor therapy ; crizotinib was shown to be efficacious in treating patients with these cancers . in a phase 1 study evaluating 143 patients  an overall response rate of 61% and estimated overall survival rates of 74.8% at 12 months 
 therefore  the evaluation of lung adenocarcinoma fna samples for alk rearrangements  in addition to egfr mutations  has become increasingly incorporated into patient management algorithms . 
 fish is currently the preferred approach to assaying lung adenocarcinomas for alk rearrangements according to expert recommendations based on review of the literature . in the united states of america  
 there is only one test approved by the food and drug administration ( fda ) for this purpose . 
 this assay utilizes a dual alk breakapart probe strategy in which orange and green labeled probes hybridize to the highly conserved translocation breakpoint region in the alk gene . 
 alk gene loci that have not undergone rearrangement typically display fused orange and green signals ( yellow ) or juxtaposed touching orange and green signals . 
 when an alk rearrangement occurs  the orange and green signals become separated . however  as the majority of the alk rearrangements involve a small inversion within chromosome 2p  rather than a rearrangement involving another chromosome  the extent to which the two signals are split is finite . in order to score a nucleus as positive for the alk rearrangement 
  the orange and green signals must be separated by a distance of > 2 signal diameters ( fig . 
 3 ) ; a nucleus can also be scored positive if a single orange signal without a corresponding green signal is observed . 
 typically  up to 100 tumor cell nuclei are scored in this assay and a lung adenocarcinoma is considered positive for the alk rearrangement if at least 15% of the nuclei are scored as positive for the rearrangement . 
 the fda has approved this dual breakapart probe set for use on paraffin embedded tissue sections . as mentioned previously  
 paraffin embedded cell blocks are processed similarly to paraffin embedded tissue blocks ; thus  cell blocks are traditionally used for the performance of alk rearrangement fish assays . 
 nonetheless  there is an observed noticeable failure rate when using and relying on cell blocks for these assays due to insufficient tumor cell material in a significant proportion of cases . 
 thus  we and others have investigated alternative cytopreparatory platforms for alk fish . in our study 
  we demonstrated the effective use of diff - quik stained direct smears for this purpose and observed that the performance of this assay using direct smears was better than the performance using cell blocks . 
 .   also examined the use of papanicolaou stained direct smears and observed that the failure rate due to insufficient cellularity was significantly higher for cell blocks than for direct smears . 
 therefore  the utilization of both diff - quik and papanicolaou stained smears are feasible analytes for alk fish . 
 recently  thinprep slides have also been shown to be a feasible platform for alk fish . 
 the advantage of utilizing cytologic preparation platforms such as direct smears and thinprep slides for this purpose is that entire tumor cell nuclei are being analyzed . 
 fish evaluation on paraffin sections derived cell blocks and other ffpe blocks are prone to signal loss in some of the tumor cells due to section truncation artifacts . in addition  alternative methods to fish have been the subject of recent investigation . 
 immunohistochemistry utilizing antibodies directed against alk is an attractive alternative as it is simpler  quicker  and less expensive . 
 the challenge associated with this approach is that the alk protein is expressed at much lower levels in alk rearranged lung tumors than in anaplastic large cell lymphoma  the prototypical alk rearranged tumor . 
 fortunately  monoclonal anti - alk antibodies ( clones d5f3  d9e4  and 5a4 ) have been shown to exhibit high sensitivity and specificity . 
 immunohistochemistry using the d5f3 and 5a4 monoclonal antibodies on cytologic specimens have been recently described and shown to exhibit a high degree of concordance with alk fish testing . 
 this supports the feasibility of utilizing an immunohistochemical approach as a first - line screening methodology to select specimens for alk fish testing . of note  
 the mouse monoclonal anti - alk1 antibody ( cd246 ) typically used for the diagnosis of anaplastic large cell lymphoma is less reliable for identifying alk rearrangements in lung adenocarcinoma ; this is most likely attributable to the limited sensitivity of this particular antibody in detecting the lower expression levels of the alk fusion proteins in lung adenocarcinoma relative to anaplastic large cell lymphoma . finally  the application of reverse transcriptase pcr ( rt - pcr ) to cytologic direct smears for alk rearrangement analysis has been recently reported . when evaluating a cohort of paired cytologic - histologic specimens by rt - pcr  mitiushkina and 
 nonetheless  as a cautionary note  there is a high degree of variability in eml4-alk fusion events with at least 13 variants of eml4-alk being reported . 
 furthermore  other fusion partners to alk such as tfg and kif5b can be observed . 
 therefore  an rt - pcr approach may not capture all clinically relevant alk rearrangements . 
 while egfr mutations and alk rearrangements represent the two best characterized  clinically actionable molecular alterations in nsclc  other molecular markers are becoming increasingly appreciated and investigated . 
 ros1 encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase and is rearranged in approximately 2% of lung adenocarcinomas . 
 met encodes another receptor tyrosine kinase  hepatocyte growth factor receptor  and is amplified in a subset of nsclc ; a significant proportion of these cases are seen in context of acquired resistance to egfr tkis . as crizotinib also targets this receptor  
 studies are under way to determine whether this agent will be effective in met amplified lung cancers . 
 therapeutic agents targeting braf  such as dabrafenib  are currently being investigated in clinical trials . 
 in addition  gene rearrangements involving the ret tyrosine kinase gene ( e.g.  kif5b - ret ) have been observed in approximately 2% of lung adenocarcinomas ; ret specific tkis such as sunitinib  sorafenib  and vandetanib may be useful in treating patients with these lung cancers . 
 finally  amplification of fgfr1 and mutations in pik3ca have been observed in some lung squamous cell carcinomas and agents targeting these gene products are also under investigation . 
 the above mentioned molecular genetic markers highlight the distinct molecular profiles that are becoming increasingly appreciated for different subtypes of nsclc  especially adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas . 
 therefore  efforts to correctly subtype cases of nsclc are important  including challenging cases of poorly - differentiated nsclc . at our institution  if the subtyping of nsclc is deemed to be challenging based on cytomorphologic evaluation alone  immunocytochemistry is utilized ; we have demonstrated that this can be accomplished using smears as well as cell blocks . 
 for example  napsin - a and thyroid transcription factor-1 are often positive in lung adenocarcinomas and can be utilized for confirming this subtype of nsclc . 
 in contrast  p63 and p40 are useful markers for confirming a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma . 
 ultimately  utilizing fna samples of nsclc for immunocytochemistry must be judiciously leveraged to ensure that sufficient material still exists for molecular ancillary testing . 
 given the continuously evolving landscape in our understanding of the genetic events responsible for lung cancer pathogenesis  the integration between anatomic pathology  particularly cytopathology  and molecular diagnostics will become even more essential . emerging molecular technological advances  such as next generation sequencing ( ngs )  that allow for high - throughput  high - sensitivity molecular analyses will likely play an important role in the management of patients with nsclc . 
 cytologic specimens  based on recent reports  represent a robust source of cellular material for ngs [ 62 - 65 ] .","

Abstract: This review discusses the importance of utilizing minimally invasive procedures such as cytologic fine-needle aspirates to obtain tissue samples for diagnosis and treatment of advanced lung cancer. The process of triaging these samples to achieve both objectives is also discussed in the context of our current understanding of molecular landscape and relevant assays.

Research and Discussion: In the era of precision medicine, the knowledge of molecular aberrations underlying non-small cell lung cancer continues to evolve. This has led to targeted therapy for advanced stage lung cancer patients, where cytologic fine-needle aspirates play a crucial role in obtaining both diagnoses and treatment-relevant molecular information.

Results and Conclusion: The use of cytologic fine-needle aspirates must be carefully considered to achieve the best treatment outcomes for patients. While striving for accurate diagnoses, the molecular assays applied to these samples must also be utilized to obtain clinically actionable information. A strategic approach is necessary to effectively utilize these minimally invasive procedures in personalized lung cancer treatment. "
"these tumors are classified as typical net ( tnet )  goblet cell carcinoid ( gcc )  and atypical gcc histologies . 
 ex - goblet or composite - goblet are further classified into signet ring cell carcinoid ( srcc ) and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoid of the appendix . 
 these tumors have a distinctive morphology showing tight clusters of cells with compact nuclei and abundant intracytoplasmic mucin resembling goblet or signet ring cells often with admixed enterochromaffin cells . 
 pathologic features of gcc include presence of large mucin filled cells with crescent nuclei arranged in small clumps or rosettes mixed with cells of typical carcinoid appearance that stain positive for chromogranin a . 
 patients with tnet have a 5-year survival ranging from 60% to 84%  with the most common site of metastasis being the liver . 
 on the other hand  atypical gcc have a more aggressive clinical course with an increased incidence of lymph node and distant metastases  along with a lower 5-year survival ranging from 36% to 56% [ 5 - 7 ] . 
 current management of gcc and atypical gcc is based on very limited data from small single institutional experiences . 
 the rarity of appendiceal net  gcc  and srcc limits the ability to conduct appropriate randomized clinical trials to explore the optimal management . to assess the role of clinicopathologic features in survival of net  gcc  and srcc patients  the outcome of cases reported to the national cancer institute s surveillance epidemiology and end results ( seer ) program was evaluated . 
 furthermore  to characterize the management of net  gcc  and srcc  a treatment strategy based on results of current analysis  published literature and institutional experience is suggested . 
 seer data collected between 1973 and 2011 was used to identify cases with appendiceal tnet  gcc  and srcc . 
 the seer registry data collection began in the early 1970s and gradually expanded from the original nine to the current 18 registries that now account for over a quarter of the united states population . 
 eligibility criteria included international classification of diseases for oncology third edition ( icd - o-3 ) codes for primary site of appendix and histologic types of tnet ( 8240  8241  8242  8246  and 8270 )  gcc ( 8243  8244  8245  and 8249 )  and srcc ( 8490 ) . 
 information regarding age at diagnosis  sex  race  year of diagnosis  grade  histology  tumor location  type of surgery  vital status and duration of follow - up  was extracted from the seer database . 
 the patients characteristics were compared among three histologic types : tnet  gcc  and srcc by chi - square test for race  sex  and stage  and kruskal - wallis test for age . 
 survival functions were estimated by the kaplan - meier method and log - rank test was used to assess the difference in overall survival ( os ) between three histologic types : tnet  gcc  and srcc . 
 univariate survival analysis for each covariate was carried out using the cox proportional hazards model . 
 the multivariate survival analysis of histology was conducted after adjusting for age  race  and sex using a backward variable selection method with an alpha level of removal of 0.1 . 
 the model was stratified by stage since there was an interaction effect between histology and stage on os . 
 9.3 ( sas institute inc .  cary  nc ) was used for data analyses . 
 null hypotheses of no difference were rejected if p - values were less than 0.05  or  equivalently  if the 95% confidence intervals ( cis ) of risk point estimates excluded 1 .

 the seer database yielded 1021 tnet patients  1582 with gcc  and 534 srcc patients . between 1973 and 2011  the incidence of tnet  gcc  and srcc increased . in 2011

 gcc patients survived better compared to srcc patients with distant disease ( hr  0.73 ; 95% ci  0.60 to 0.90 ; p=0.003 ) . after adjusting for age  stage  and histology 
  there was a statistically significant difference in survival for srcc patients treated with hemicolectomy compared to appendectomy ( p=0.01 ) . 
 there was no significant difference in survival for tnet and gcc patients based the type of surgery ( p=0.21 and p=0.94  respectively ) . in the multivariate analysis stratified by stage and age  there was a statistically significant difference in survival favoring tnet ( hr  0.41 ; 95% ci  0.31 to 0.55 ) and gcc ( hr  0.59 ; 95% ci  0.48 to 0.72 ) over srcc . 
 the analysis of the seer registry sample confirms the differences in presentation and outcome of these diseases . 
 tnet tend to occur at a younger age and has a less aggressive clinical course  early stage at presentation and significantly improved os . at the other end of the disease spectrum  
 the aggressive nature of srcc is reflected by the high risk of distant metastasis at diagnosis  and worse survival outcomes even when controlled for stage . 
 the reported sex distribution in tnet ranges from a female preponderance ( 63% to 73% ) to evenly distributed . 
 similarly for gcc  literature reports range from female gender predominance  to equal distribution . 
 most of these series are based on small numbers of patients from single institution studies . 
 the current report confirms  using a large national database  that there are gender differences in distribution of tnet  gcc  and srcc ( p < 0.001 ) . for srcc histology  we confirmed a higher prevalence amongst women in this seer analysis as compared to gcc histology  consistent with a previous report . 
 additionally  appendiceal srcc appear to be clinically similar to right - sided  microsatellite unstable  signet ring cell colon adenocarcinoma with respect to gender distribution  age of diagnosis and outcome . 
 this raises the question whether appendiceal srcc and right colon adenocarcinomas behave more like a single disease entity distinct from other colorectal cancer ( crc ) adenocarcinoma and appendiceal gcc . 
 this apparent difference in clinical behavior will require further characterization through genomic analysis of crc srcc  appendiceal srcc and typical gcc . 
 hence  a molecularly based classification may facilitate prognostication and perhaps target identification for future clinical trials . 
 the analysis of the seer data confirms that histology and stage at presentation are the major determinants of outcome . 
 the high risk of metastatic disease in the srcc patients confirms the aggressive clinical behavior of this tumor . 
 the rate of metastasis at diagnosis in srcc histology ranges from 14%   to 63% . the survival advantage for tnet and gcc over srcc persisted after controlling for the difference in stage distribution . 
 similar observations were reported with 5-year survival of patients with advanced stage gcc  srcc and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoid tumor being 100%  38%  and 0%  respectively . given their rarity  there is no consensus on the management of appendiceal tnet  gcc  or srcc . 
 the treatments employed included surgical resection and cytoreduction of primary tumor and metastatic sites  intraperitoneal chemotherapy and systemic fluorouracil - based chemotherapy . 
 debulking surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy treatment is not well - established in appendiceal net  gcc  and srcc tumors  although it improves appendiceal mucinous adecarcinoma . 
 clinically  the management decisions are usually based on histologic subtype and stage  as well as the patient s performance status . 
 early stage tnet  gcc  or srcc should be managed surgically  although the extent of surgery is an open question . 
 historically  the accepted surgical dogma was that simple appendectomy is sufficient for resection of tnet less than 2 cm . 
 recent reports demonstrated that appendiceal tnet measuring less than 2 cm may have regional nodal involvement  raising the question whether a more extensive surgery than simple appendectomy is required irrespective of size . 
 these observations are further supported by a seer analysis where 32.8% of patients with net less than 2 cm in size ( 20/61 ) had lymph node metastasis . 
 the north american neuroendocrine tumor society ( nanets )   and european neuroendocrine tumor society ( enets )   guidelines suggest right hemicolectomy for all tumors > 2 cm or presence of deep mesoappendiceal invasion  positive or unclear margins  higher proliferative rate ( grade 2 )  angi olymphatic invasion  and mixed histology  irrespective of tumor size . 
 while simple appendectomy may be adequate for early stage gcc  cecal involvement or high mitotic count index should be an indication for right hemicolectomy . 
 surgery for srcc should always involve a right hemicolectomy due to the high likelihood of lymph node metastasis  irrespective of the size of the primary appendiceal mass . 
 this is supported by our analysis of the seer data that indicates superior survival for patients with srcc who undergo right hemicolectomy . 
 the role of surgical resection of the ovaries in female patients with localized srcc or gcc remains controversial . 
 a summary of the nanets   and enets   guidelines is provided in table 4 . unlike crc adenocarcinoma  the role of adjuvant therapy is not established for tnet  gcc  or srcc . based on our analysis  
 patients with tnet have an excellent os and therefore adjuvant therapy is not indicated . on the other hand  
 given the high risk of systemic metastasis in srcc  we recommend offering adjuvant therapy for all patients undergoing resection . in our analysis of the seer sample  
 the outcome of patients with early stage gcc appears favorable  suggesting that patients with gcc should be considered for adjuvant therapy only if they have high risk features such as cecal invasion  perforation  or lymph node involvement . 
 for gcc patients with advanced stage disease  options of treatments include peritoneal debulking with intraperitoneal chemotherapy for patient with limited peritoneal disease or systemic fluorouracilbased chemotherapy . for srcc patients  
 our recommendations include treating with systemic fluorouracil - based chemotherapy initially and only consider peritoneal resection for patients with good response to initial therapy . a summary of the proposed treatment algorithm is provided in fig . 
 predictive and prognostic biomarkers are not well defined for these diseases . in an attempt to identify gene variations between appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma and gcc  we profiled nine gcc samples using second - generation gene sequencing . only one patient with gcc ( 11% ) had kras mutation  and two had tp53 mutation ; myc  smad4  and apc mutations were absent in gcc . 
 proved the absence of kras mutations in 16 and 14 gcc samples . in the light of its rarity  molecular differentiation markers for appendiceal tnet  gcc  and 
 further confirmation with larger studies is needed to evaluate pathologic genomic sequencing for the three histologies in order to detect differences in survival and possible future biomarkers that predict response to specific target treatments . 
 the seer registry findings confirm the distinct clinical entities of tnet  gcc  and srcc with respect to presentation and outcome .","

1) Abstract: This study aimed to assess the characteristics and outcomes of appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors (TNET), goblet cell carcinoids (GCC), and signet-ring cell cancers (SRCC) using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database.
2) Research and Discussion: Demographics, surgical approaches, and clinicopathologic features of 3,137 patients with TNET, GCC, and SRCC were collected and analyzed. TNET patients presented at a younger age and had better survival than SRCC patients, while GCC patients had comparable outcomes to TNET.
3) Results and Conclusion: The overall survival for GCC and TNET patients was longer compared to SRCC patients. This report suggests a spectrum of diseases with varying characteristics and outcomes, requiring a tailored treatment approach."

Abstract:
This study presents a concise and efficient synthesis of two new diastereoisomeric 2-aza-5-phosphabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes using trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline. These chiral phosphines were found to be effective catalysts for the reaction of -substituted allenoates with imines, providing enantiomerically enriched pyrrolines in good yields and high enantioselectivities. These diastereoisomeric phosphines acted as pseudoenantiomers, resulting in opposite absolute configurations of the chiral pyrrolines.

Research and Discussion:
In this study, two diastereoisomeric 2-aza-5-phosphabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes were synthesized from trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline, a naturally occurring compound. These syntheses were found to be efficient and straightforward, with simple purification methods. The resulting chiral phosphines were then used as catalysts for the reaction of -substituted allenoates with imines, leading to enantiomerically enriched pyrrolines with excellent enantioselectivities.

Results and Conclusion:
The two diastereoisomeric phosphines functioned as pseudoenantiomers, providing chiral pyrrolines with opposite absolute configurations. The obtained chiral pyrrolines were highly enantioenriched in good yields. This synthesis offers a concise and efficient method for the preparation of these diastereoisomeric phosphines, and their use as catalysts for enantioselective transformations is promising. Further studies on the application of these phosphines in other reactions are warranted."
"igg4-rd is a newly recognized fibroinflammatory condition of unknown etiology characterized by tumefactive lesions  dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration rich in igg4-positive plasma cells  storiform fibrosis and an elevated serum igg4 level [ 13 ] . 
 the kidney is one of the organs commonly affected by igg4-rd  and tubulointerstitial nephritis ( tin ) with infiltration of numerous igg4-positive plasma cells is the predominant type of kidney lesion [ 47 ] . 
 high levels of igg and igg4 are striking and characteristic features of renal involvement such as multiple lesions with low attenuation demonstrated by contrast - enhanced computed tomography are often evident [ 47 ] . 
 although tin is the main feature of the kidney lesion in igg4-rd  some glomerular lesions have also been described  and membranous nephropathy ( mn ) has been recognized as the most common form [ 48 ] . in previously reported cases of mn associated with igg4-rd

 oral administration of prednisolone was initiated at 40 mg daily  and the patient 's clinical symptoms including jaundice and anorexia improved rapidly . 
 the laboratory data and multiple organ lesions also improved  while proteinuria persisted at around 3 g / day . 
 it has been reported that mn is present in 7% of kidney biopsy specimens in igg4-rd . 
 most cases of mn associated with igg4-rd are accompanied by igg4-related tin [ 46  9  10 ]  although recent reports have also documented mn without tin but with other features of igg4-rd ( 8  11  12 ) . in mn associated with igg4-rd  positive deposition of igg4 in the glomerular basement membrane has been observed  either predominantly or together with other igg subclasses [ 812 ] . 
 originally  the immunofluorescent examination of igg subclasses was known as a very useful tool to distinguish the primary mn from the secondary mn . 
 predominant deposition of igg4  often accompanied by other subclasses such as igg1  was one of the well - known features of idiopathic mn . 
 moreover  idiopathic mn and mn associated with igg4-rd share an essential immunologic feature known as  th2 cytokine - mediated immune reaction [ 14  15 ]  suggesting that these two disorders share common pathophysiologic processes for increased production of th2 cytokines and subsequent increase of igg4 . on the other hand  
 these two disorders differ in many other features  including clinical symptoms  laboratory parameters and radiographic findings . 
 an anti - pla2r antibody  which has been described as a major target antigen involved in idiopathic mn and seen in 7080% of patients with idiopathic mn [ 13  1618 ]  has been reported to be negative in all cases of igg4-rd   and also cases of mn associated with igg4-rd [ 8  10  12 ]  suggesting no involvement of this antibody in the development of igg4-rd . in the present case 
  there was no evidence of any association of igg4-rd based on the clinical symptoms  serological data and imaging findings when the patient developed nephrotic syndrome . 
 therefore  it was reasonable to have diagnosed the present case as idiopathic mn at the time of onset of nephrotic syndrome . 
 the anti - pla2r antibody is described as negative in all cases evaluated in mn associated with igg4-rkd   and was also negative in this patient  although the result was obtained from the serum 3 years after the diagnosis of idiopathic mn and after corticosteroid therapy . however  2025% of patients with idiopathic mn are reported to be negative for the antibody [ 1618 ] . 
 the absence of the anti - pla2r antibody is thus only partly helpful to distinguish from idiopathic mn . 
 interestingly  the patient 's total serum protein level increased gradually without any significant improvement of proteinuria or elevation of the serum albumin level ( table  1 )  and eventually the clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities of igg4-rd became evident 3 years after the onset of idiopathic mn . 
 accordingly  it is possible that some conditions underlying the persistent predominance of th2-type immune responses during the 3 years of follow - up might have led to the development of igg4-rd . 
 currently  idiopathic mn is defined as mn without any other disorder that could cause secondary mn  with predominant deposition of igg4 in the glomerular basement membrane . 
 however  mn associated with igg4-rd has also been revealed to be igg4-predominant and  interestingly  the igg subclass of the anti - pla2r antibody seen in idiopathic mn is predominantly igg4 . 
 although the pathogenesis of igg4-rd is poorly understood  it may share some common mechanisms with idiopathic mn  and thus a comparative study of the two diseases might be helpful for clarifying their pathogenesis . 
 consideration for igg4-rd in mn  including systemic evaluation or measurement of serum igg4 level  would be necessary in addition to the evaluation of the anti - pla2r antibody and igg subclasses in the immune complex deposited on the glomerular basement membrane .","

Abstract:
This case report presents a patient who was diagnosed with IgG4-related disease after 3 years of follow-up for idiopathic membranous nephropathy. It highlights the potential connection between these two conditions and suggests a shared underlying mechanism.

Research and Discussion:
Recent studies have shown that idiopathic membranous nephropathy could be considered a glomerular lesion of IgG4-related kidney diseases. This case further supports this hypothesis by demonstrating the development of IgG4-RD 3 years after the initial diagnosis of MN.

Results and Conclusion:
The timing of IgG4-RD development in relation to the diagnosis of idiopathic MN in this case suggests a possible link between the two conditions. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and potential shared pathogenesis between IgG4-RD and idiopathic MN."
"an estimated 170 million people worldwide have hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection and over 20000 new cases emerge every year . hcv infection frequently persists and may cause cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma . in the us and most developed nations  where the prevalence of infection is 1%2%  hcv is the leading cause of chronic liver disease.1 hcv infection is a serious public health problem in egypt  and is the country with the highest hcv prevalence  where 10%20% of the general population is infected.2 interferons are a group of glycoproteins that modulate the activity of the immune system . 
 recombinant alpha - interferon ( ifn ) has recently been approved as a therapy for chronic hepatitis c  for its antiviral effects and inhibition of cell proliferation.3 although interferon - based therapy is widely used for the treatment of chronic hcv  it is not without its disadvantages . 
 treatment duration lasts for months  and is often fraught with potentially dangerous side effects . some of these side effects  such as influenza - like illness  myalgias  depression  and cytopenias can be intolerable resulting in premature treatment cessation  but have no lasting effects . 
 ocular complications are among the complications of interferon therapy and include retinal hemorrhages  cotton wool spots  loss of color vision  cataracts  glaucoma  and occasionally retinal artery or vein obstruction . 
 although the incidence of ophthalmological disorders while on interferon therapy is low  this can result in loss of vision.411 
 in this prospective case series study  one hundred patients with chronic hepatitis - c under interferon ( inf ) therapy were consecutively recruited from patients attending the outpatient ophthalmic clinic at the university hospital  faculty of medicine  al - azhar university  assuit . 
 the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee at al - azhar university hospital . 
 written informed consent was obtained from all patients included in the study  and then in addition to the medical and laboratory examination  all patients were subjected to full ophthalmological assessment to evaluate the retinopathy associated interferon therapy . 
 inclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) seropositivity for anti - hcv antibodies determined using elisa ; ( 2 ) first use of interferon therapy . 
 exclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) previous interferon therapy ; ( 2 ) patients with hepatitis b ; ( 3 ) patients with decompensated liver ; ( 4 ) patients with renal failure ; ( 5 ) patients with cardiovascular disorders such as coronary insufficiency  congestive heart failure  and ischemic stroke ; ( 6 ) patients with a dense cataract  visual field abnormality  glaucoma  or any other ocular abnormalities . 
 evaluation before treatment : history of visual loss  hazy vision  and ocular disease or ocular surgeries ophthalmological examination : ( 1 ) best corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) measured using landolt s broken rings ; ( 2 ) pupillary reaction ( direct and consensual ) and if there is afferent pupillary defect ; ( 3 ) full slit - lamp examination ; ( 4 ) intraocular pressure ( iop ) measured by goldmann s applanation tonometer ; ( 5 ) fundus biomicroscopy ( carried out after maximum pupillary dilation by a combination of tropicamide 1% eye drops and phenylephrine 2.5% eye drops using both slit - lamp biomicroscopy with noncontact + 90 d volk lens and/or goldmann contact lens ) ; ( 6 ) examination of the retinal periphery using an indirect ophthalmoscope . medical examinations and abdominal ultrasonography 
 investigations : ( 1 ) ocular  both colored fundus photography and fundus fluorescein angiography ( ffa ) ; ( 2 ) laboratory ( including enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ellsa ) test for hepatitis surface ag and ab ; polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) for hepatitis c virus rna ; full blood count ; prothrombin time ; direct and indirect bilirubin ; fasting blood sugar ; serum creatinine ; liver enzymes ( serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ) ; alanine aminotransferase . 
 patients were treated with pegylated interferon -2a at a dose of 180 mcg injected subcutaneously once weekly for 48 weeks . 
 all patients underwent clinical and laboratory assessments  ophthalmic examination  at 15 days  1 month  2 months  3 months  6 months  8 months  and 9 months after the start of ifn treatment . 
 patients were treated with pegylated interferon -2a at a dose of 180 mcg injected subcutaneously once weekly for 48 weeks . 
 all patients underwent clinical and laboratory assessments  ophthalmic examination  at 15 days  1 month  2 months  3 months  6 months  8 months  and 9 months after the start of ifn treatment . 
 initially  120 patients fulfilled the criteria for ifn therapy  but 20 of them were excluded due to non - compliance with the follow - up visits and due to the presence of diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy . also  two patients died during the study time  due to a disease not related to hepatitis  so these patients are not included . 
 therefore  a total of 100 patients ( 68 male and 32 female )  with chronic hcv were selected . 
 after the start of interferon therapy  16 out of 100 patients ( 16% ) developed retinopathy which was bilateral in 12 ( 75% ) patients and unilateral in 4 ( 25% ) patients . 
 retinopathy was initially diagnosed by the appearance of a cotton wool spot in 14 patients . in four of the 14 patients  retinal hemorrhage 
 two of the 16 patients who developed retinopathy were diagnosed by retinal hemorrhage without cotton wool spots . 
 one patient ( not diabetic or hypertensive ) had cystoid macular edema  this was the only patient who complained of the visual disturbance due to interferon . 
 all patients had bcva of ( 6/6 ) during ifn treatment except for three patients : the one who had cystoid macular edema ( bcva was 6/12 and returned to 6/6 after cessation of treatment ) and two patients with ametropic amblyopia . 
 in addition  we confirmed that all patients with hypertension had no retinopathy using the standard classification . to exclude the possibility of the development of diabetic or hypertension retinopathy after ifn treatment  we deleted the data obtained from patients who had diabetes or hypertension and any retinopathy 2 months after the cessation of ifn treatment . 
 retinopathy was first diagnosed 214 weeks after the start of treatment and disappeared in 11 of the 16 patients despite the continuation of therapy . 
 a few cotton wool spots  retinal hemorrhages  or both were observed in the remaining five patients at the end of treatment but resolved within 1 month after treatment was stopped . 
 no other ocular complications ( ie  cataracts  glaucoma  retinal artery  or vein obstruction ) were observed . 
 the mean hemoglobin values  white blood cell  red blood cell  and platelet counts decreased significantly ( p < 0.0001 ) during ifn treatment . 
 the clinical profiles and laboratory data of the patients are shown in tables 1 and 2  respectively . 
 interferon - associated retinopathy was first recognized in 1990 when ikebe and associates reported a 39-year - old patient who developed retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots following intravenous administration of interferon.12 the underlying mechanisms of interferon - induced retinopathy are not completely understood . 
 guyer et al13 had proposed an immune complex deposition causing occlusion of retinal capillaries leading to cotton wool spot formation . on the other hand  an ischemic insult  similar to that seen in hypertensive and diabetic patients could be another potential mechanism by which these changes develop.14 some studies1516 
 have shown a relatively higher incidence of retinopathy ( symptomatic or asymptomatic ) ranging from 19% to 64% during treatment with interferon . 
 panetta and gilani17 and cuthbertson et al14 show relatively lower incidences of retinopathy ( 3.8% and 6.25%  respectively ) . 
 similar to other studies459 our study also shows that retinal changes usually develop within the first 3 months of interferon treatment  a fact that may favor an immune etiology rather than a cumulative effect of interferon leading to the development of retinopathy . 
 retinopathy developed by week 14 in most of the patients ( 13/16  81.25% ) after the start of therapy and disappeared in the majority of the patients ( 11/16  68.75% ) during the 48 week period in which the patients were receiving the treatment . 
 this suggests that treatment can be continued despite the development of retinopathy in many patients . 
 however  two patients who developed cotton wool spots early in the therapy ( 2 weeks ) thereafter suffered from retinal hemorrhage in a prolonged manner . 
 therefore  patients who develop cotton wool spots early on during therapy should be carefully monitored . however  as reported in previous studies41314 most of the patients with retinopathy in this study were asymptomatic . 
 this study confirms previous reports that retinopathy is a temporary and asymptomatic complication of interferon therapy . 
 therefore there is no rule for suspending the use of interferon in patients who develop retinopathy or any other ocular side effects . 
 it s commonly agreed among authors that careful monitoring should be performed in the presence of any ocular sign  even without symptoms.18

1) Abstract: This study evaluated the occurrence of retinopathy in chronic hepatitis C patients undergoing interferon therapy. Cotton wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, and other retinal changes were observed in 16% of the patients during a 9-month follow-up period. 

2) Research and Discussion: The study included 100 patients with chronic hepatitis C and utilized complete ophthalmological examination to identify retinal changes. Results showed that interferon therapy can lead to dose-related retinopathy, which is mostly reversible. Periodic fundoscopic examinations are important for early detection and prevention of permanent visual loss. 

3) Results and Conclusion: Of the patients examined, 16% developed retinopathy in the form of cotton wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, cystoid macular edema, and capillary non-perfusion. This suggests a need for increased monitoring and management of retinopathy in patients undergoing interferon therapy. Overall, the study highlights the importance of timely detection and intervention to prevent permanent visual loss in this patient population."
"nathan  as an oncology fellow  knew well that white blood cells fought infections . 
 this was an experiment repeated in front of us all the time   he says : chemotherapy lowered his patients ' white blood cells and increased their risk of infections . 
 mackaness had shown that macrophage activation did not depend on direct contact with t cells ( 1 )  suggesting the possibility of a secreted factor . 
 when nathan tested the supernatant from activated t cells  he saw that it did indeed induce macrophage activation ( 2 ) . 
 nathan got a rough idea of the molecular weight ( 3 )  but that was  the best anyone could do   he says . 
 protein separation methods were primitive  and cloned proteins and monoclonal antibodies would only become available a decade later . 
 henry murray  one of nathan 's collaborators  sums up the feeling of frustration :  we were all nibbling at the edges of the same problem .  nathan therefore changed tack to take a closer look at the activated macrophages . 
 short - lived neutrophils were known to produce hydrogen peroxide  and nathan found the same was true of longer - lived activated macrophages ( 4 ) . unlike previous signs of macrophage activation  increased spreading  phagocytosis  and glucose metabolism this so - called  respiratory burst 
 ifn had been on the cover of time magazine  and recombinant murine ifn was found to induce macrophages to kill tumor cells ( 5 ) . 
 nathan  now a faculty member in zanvil cohn 's  macrophage factory  at rockefeller university ( new york  ny )  thought ifn might also activate macrophages to kill intracellular parasites . 
 consistent with this idea  ifn was made by antigen - stimulated t cells and was associated with defense from infection . 
 now the respiratory burst gave nathan an assay  berish rubin ( down the street at the new york blood center ) supplied an ifn monoclonal antibody  and a phone call to genentech yielded recombinant ifn. in a seminal paper published in the journal of experimental medicine in 1983  nathan was thus able to show that depleting ifn from unpurified t cell supernatants decreased the respiratory burst activity and the killing of intracellular protozoa in human macrophages . adding back recombinant ifn into this mix restored macrophage activation ( 6 ) . 
 i had an assay  a hunch  a history of purifying proteins that did this  and the serendipity of meeting with people nearby who had the antibody . 
 nathan next showed that ifn worked in people . injecting recombinant ifn directly into cutaneous lesions of lepromatous leprosy patients induced macrophage infiltration  hydrogen peroxide production  and killing of the causative pathogen  mycobacterium leprae ( 7 ) . in the 1990s  
 the macrophages of children with ifn receptor deficiencies were shown to be defective in killing mycobacteria ( 8) . 
 tracing the pathway from t cells to macrophages to bacteria started  for nathan  in 1967  and he says  we still haven't finished making the molecular links .","

Abstract:
In 1983, Carl Nathan discovered the start signal for macrophages to begin producing a toxic combination of lysosomal enzymes, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide that can eliminate intracellular pathogens. This signal comes in the form of the cytokine IFN, secreted by T cells. 

Research and Discussion:
Carl Nathan's groundbreaking research in 1983 proved the crucial role of IFN in activating macrophages to launch an immune response against intracellular pathogens. This discovery shed light on the intricate communication between T cells and macrophages, and their coordinated efforts in fighting off infections. 

Results and Conclusion:
 Carl Nathan's discovery not only identified the signal that triggers macrophages to produce a destructive cocktail, but also provided insight into the complex mechanisms of the immune system.

 was initiated by our team about a decade ago  and this has been continued at the medical research center  kasturba health society  mumbai . 
 the comparative effects of three plant products on perimenopausal symptoms  quality of life ( qol ) and clinical biochemistry have been reported by our group earlier . 
 our observation of frequent mood changes and sleep disturbances in women in the premenopausal group prompted us to undertake a study of cyclic symptoms in maitreyi hcp . 
 in this communication  we describe the preliminary findings from the analysis of premenstrual symptoms in 200 consecutive women who underwent a comprehensive check - up in the maitreyi hcp . 
 diagnosis of premenstrual tension syndrome ( pmts ) is based on the following criteria as per the american association of obstetricians and gynecologists : a 30% increase in the intensity of symptoms of premenstrual syndrome ( measured using a standardized instrument ) from cycle days 510 as compared with the 6-day interval before the onset of menses and documentation of these changes for at least two consecutive cycles . 
 at least one of the following affective and somatic symptoms during the 5 days before menses in previous cycles . 
 affective symptoms : depression  angry outbursts  irritability  anxiety  confusion  social withdrawal . 
 somatic symptoms : breast tenderness  abdominal bloating  headache  swelling of extremities ; symptoms relieved from days 4 through 13 of the menstrual cycle . to determine the prevalence of premenstrual cyclic symptoms in women who attended the maitreyi hcp . 
 to determine the prevalence of premenstrual cyclic symptoms in women who attended the maitreyi hcp . 
 maitreyi 's hcp for women above 35 includes comprehensive health questionnaire  gynecological and physician 's check - up  biochemical investigations of complete blood count  glucose tolerance test  lipid profile  liver functions  serum creatinine and serum thyroid stimulating hormone . 
 pap smear  pelvic sonography and urine and stool examination for occult blood are also included . 
 a multidisciplinary trans - system team offers this community - oriented programme to women with voluntary services by the consultants . bone mineral density and mammography 
 this analysis is a preliminary report restricted to the premenstrual cyclic symptomatolgy in 200 consecutive women who attended this program over 2 years . 
 a special case record form has been used and a detailed medical and surgical history is included in the same . 
 twelve women who continued to menstruate beyond 50  up to 55 years  have been included in the analysis . only those who had symptoms at least during two consecutive cycles or more were included in the analysis . 
 the american society of obstetricians and gynecologists and the american psychiatric society have now brought out the consensus criteria for inclusion of the condition in pmts or premenstrual dysphoric disorder ( pmdd )  the latter usually requiring treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms . 
 accordingly  pmts is said to be present when the woman reports three or more of the following symptoms in two cycles or more[46 ] : there are 36 symptoms as listed below in the sf-36 mental component . in the present analysis 
  the symptoms were classified as per the medical outcomes study short form-36 for assessment of premenstrual symptoms  and the presence of three of these occurring over two or more cycles was labelled as pmts : anxiety  irritability  depression  tension  mood swings  loss of self - control  difficulty in concentration  insomnia  confusion  headache  crying attacks  fatigue  aches  breast tenderness  cramps  bloatedness  food craving  visual disturbances  tiredness  fatigue  puffiness of the face  weight gain  altered libido  aggression  nausea  vomiting  acne  skin rashes  constipation  diarrhea  joint stiffness  backache  abdominal cramps / pain  anger attacks  aggravation of epilepsy  aggravation of asthma . 
 of 107 women  26 ( 24.3% ) did not report any premenstrual symptoms at all and 81 ( 75.7% ) reported at least one symptom [ table 1 ] . 
 number of symptoms experienced by women in different age groups in two or more cycles maximum frequency was seen in women from 35 to 50 years of age . 
 forty women ( 37.4% ) who reported premenstrual symptoms had three or more cyclic symptoms for more than two cycles and could be classified as those with pmts . 
 fifteen ( 14% ) had five or more symptoms cyclically in at least two cycles . 
 almost 10% reported five or more symptoms inclusive of anger attacks and could be labelled as pmdd . 
 mastalgia was the most common symptom ( 50.5% )  followed by mood changes ( 46.7% )  depression ( 7.5% ) and anger attacks ( 6.5% ) . 
 pmdd was present in 10% of the cases who were referred to a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist . 
 many women have premenstrual cyclic symptoms of psychological or physical nature and  sometimes  these limit their functional capacity . 
 the symptoms due to neurohormonal imbalance or ageing may start as early as 35 years of age . 
 pmts is an entity that causes considerable morbidity  and in about 3% of the women  it may disrupt the woman 's life when severe symptoms recur . 
 when there are severe symptoms like anger attacks  depression and suicidal thoughts  special attention including psychiatric consultation may be required  i.e. the pmdd . 
 the prevalence of pmts in general is about 210% for disabling symptoms  while minor symptoms may be present in up to 85% of the women.[468 ] in the present series  75.7% reported at least one symptom cyclically . in the present series 
 halbreich has reported that in about 20% of the women  the symptoms are severe enough to warrant treatment . 
 dean et al . have reported a prevalence of 1930% when all women from 18 to 45 years of age were screened . 
 in a recent survey of 3913 women of 15 - 54 years of age  tschudin et al . observed that about 10% reported pmts and 3.1% reported pmdd . 
 when the indian scenario is considered  chaturvedi et al . in the 1990s have reported a prevalence of 20% in a general population and severe symptoms in 8% . 
 the same authors have  in a later study  reported suicidal ideas and/or death wish during the premenstrual period in 10% of the subjects  more so among college students and industrial working women as compared with housewives . 
 banerjee et al .  in a group of 62 women  reported pmdd in 6.4% . 
 there is a close association between mood disorders and the sleep rhythm and disturbances in sleep pattern in premenopausal age.[31314 ] many women and their physicians regard pmts as a physiological phenomenon and do not think treatment is necessary . 
 however  it does affect qol in some and it is therefore essential to identify which women will benefit from lifestyle management and which will require pharmacological intervention . those who want to reach their full functional potential and who find that the symptoms are hampering their progress or interfering with normal daily routine should be certainly offered safe pharmacological interventions provided that they come for routine follow - ups . 
 because there are many etiological factors that have been described as probably causative  and multiple causes may be present in an individual woman  there is a wide variety of treatment options and combinations depending on specific symptoms and their severity . 
 the postulated causes range from hormonal imbalances like progesterone deficiency  prolactin excess  thyroid hypofunction  fluctuation in circulating level of estrogen ; electrolyte disturbances like rennin - angiotensin alterations  antidiuretic hormone excess  decreased colloidosmotic pressure ; neurotransmitter disturbances with serotonin or gamma - amino - butyric - acid  or -endorphin activity alternations  serotonin metabolism alternations or prostaglandin imbalance ; cytokine imbalances like excess of interleukin ( il)-6  il-1  and tumor necrosis factor ( tnf)- ; nutritional deficiencies like vitamin b or vitamin d deficiency ; lack of exercise or psychosocial disturbances.[8101315 ] the treatment therefore will depend on the particular symptom complex in the individual woman . in concordance with other authors  
 lifestyle measures like regular exercise  balanced nutritious diet and regular hours of sleep will benefit all  and may be adequate for some.[1921 ] for others  pharmacological interventions may be helpful if required . 
 the therapy is multipronged and has to be individualized . while simple measures like the institution of physical exercises  relaxation techniques like yoga and vitamin and mineral supplements are adequate for most women[1924 ] some require hormonal therapy with combined oral contraceptives or regulation of fluid and electrolytes . as a matter of fact  combined oral contraceptives are used frequently in the more severe cases and  drosperidone  containing newer combinations  is relatively free from side - effects . 
 selective estrogen modulators  including nonsteroidal agents like centchroman  also could be useful  particularly in women with contraindications to hormones . 
 few women need psychiatric consultation and will benefit from antidepressants  particularly sertraline or fluoxetine  while some respond to prolactin inhibitors like bromocriptine or cabergoline . 
 complementary and alternative therapies like soy  hypericum perforatum and gingko biloba have a definite role to play.[242931 ] evening primrose oil does not have significant efficacy . 
 we have observed relief of mild to moderate premenstrual symptoms with soy  gycyrrhiza glabra and withania somnifera . we have also observed complete relief of pmts in two women treated with an extract rich in saraca asoka  prescribed for menorrhagia  which was also controlled . 
 there is need for more research in this area because commonly used drugs may have side - effects that may prevent regular long - term use [ table 2 ] . 
 common side - effects of existing pharmacologic therapies for pmts recently  two well - designed studies have shown that pmts leads to loss of work hours and economic losses  and does not allow women to reach their full potential.[3436 ] effective and safe therapy is indicated . it is also important to bear in mind that other chronic diseases like migraine or depression or irritable bowel syndrome could be exaggerated during the premenstrual phase  and a multidisciplinary team should evaluate and manage such cases .

 it is also important to bear in mind that other chronic diseases like migraine or depression or irritable bowel syndrome could be exaggerated during the premenstrual phase  and a multidisciplinary team should evaluate and manage such cases . 
 it is very important to ensure that the first option is nonpharmacological as many women may respond to it . 
 pharmacotherapy can be added in recalcitrant cases and must be individualized as per the woman . 
 great care should be taken to avoid side - effects and drug interactions because multiple therapies may be used . 
 medicinal plants may be a safe alternative in some women . because pmts could be a predictor for menopausal syndrome 
  it will be useful to warn women with pmts and their families of a flare up or the need for long - term follow - up . 
 have reported pmts to be predictive of menopausal syndrome in a long - term follow - up study and have shown the association of hormonal imbalance with depressive symptoms in women .","

Abstract:
This study aimed to determine the prevalence of premenstrual cyclic symptoms in perimenopausal women, using data from women attending the Bhavan's SPARC Maitreyi's Health Care Programme. A total of 107 women between 36 and 55 years were included in the final analysis. Results showed that 38.3% of women experienced 3 or more symptoms of premenstrual tension syndrome, with 4.7% reporting severe symptoms.

Research and Discussion:
The study analyzed data from 107 women between 36 and 55 years who attended the Bhavan's SPARC Maitreyi's Health Care Programme. Results showed that 38.3% of women had 3 or more symptoms of premenstrual tension syndrome, with the most common symptom being mastalgia or breast heaviness. The study also found that 11 women had sought treatment for premenstrual tension syndrome.

Results and Conclusion:
Out of the 107 women included in the study, 38.3% experienced 3 or more symptoms of premenstrual tension syndrome, with 4.7% reporting severe symptoms. The study showed that premenstrual cyclic symptoms are common among women between 36 and 55 years, with about half experiencing 3 or more symptoms. Further research is needed to explore effective treatment options for these symptoms."
"according to the korean national statistical office  the main cause of death in korea was cancer in 2012 . 
 the total number of deaths due to cancer in 2012 was 267221  which was increased by 9825 ( 3.8% ) compared to 2011.1 this was the all - time high since 1983 . 
 currently  the treatment of cancer patients in the medical field consists mainly of surgery  radiation therapy  and chemotherapy . 
 seventy to eighty percent of cancer patients in chemotherapy experienced side effects such as anemia  the decreased number of white blood cells and/or platelets  oral mucositis  vomiting  diarrhea  hair loss  and disabled generative functions as chemotherapy also affects the rapidly proliferating normal cells.2 most side effects are temporary and patients recover fully ; but  some side effects may take months or years to completely disappear . to decrease side effects from non - specific cytotoxicity  
 new drugs  such as targeted agents  are being developed to selectively destroy specific cancer cells . however  because of problems  such as tolerance manifestation  partly critical toxicity  decrease in sensitivity  and restriction in subjects  new drugs take only a small portion of the cancer treatment realm.3 chemoprevention is defined as the use of nontoxic or relatively safe chemical substances  such as vitamins  plant extracts  and pharmaceuticals to prevent cancer . 
 it is effective in decreasing cancer risk and is helpful in early stages of cancer.4 hence  regular consumption of anticancer foods that display no or little toxicity to the body and boost efficacy of anti - tumor drugs or stop the development of tolerance would be beneficial in preventing cancer . 
 thus  consumption of plant - derived natural foods to prevent cancer with few side effects and toxicity is crucial.5 recently  there has been a growing interest in probiotics due to the discovery of multidrug - resistant organisms that are tolerant to antibiotics . 
 probiotics is derived from a greek word meaning  for life and holds the opposite meaning from antibiotics which means  against life. probiotics consist of microorganisms and substances  which modify the intestinal microflora  and when used as dietary supplement they have positive effects on health such as fortification of host immune function  suppression of diarrhea  and inhibition of carcinogenesis.6 kimchi  a korean traditional food  is fermented by probiotic lactic acid bacteria.7 kimchi lactic acid bacteria are known to suppress the activity of carcinogen - activating enzymes  such as azoreductase  nitroreductase  7--dehydrogenase  -glucosidase  and -glucuronidase and inactivate or neutralize the cancer - causing agents and pathogenic microbes.8 in addition  the intake of lactic acid bacteria as part of kimchi improves bowel movement  strengthens immunity  ameliorates hepatocirrhosis  and decreases serum cholesterol levels.910 among lactic acid bacteria identified during the fermentation of kimchi  weissella  lactobacillus  leuconostoc and pediococcus species are known to play an important role in kimchi fermentation.1113 this commentary deals with anticarcinogenic effects of kimchi and lactic acid bacteria  weissella cibaria and lactobacillus plantarum separated from kimchi  which are known to be predominant in kimchi . 
 kimchi  a fermented cabbage indispensable to korean cuisine  was once considered to be a risk factor for stomach cancer . however  unless one consumes kimchi that contains excess salt  kimchi  in general  is a healthy food recognized for its antioxidant  antiobese  cancer preventive  and other health beneficial effects.7 cancer preventive / anticarcinogenic activity of kimchi is associated with the type of ingredients and products formed during fermentation.14 the kimchi s main ingredient  chinese cabbage  has been considered to be effective in preventing stomach cancer according to epidemiologic studies and is known to inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis due to its abundance in dietary fiber.15 garlic  in particular  has been acknowledged for its anticancer effect due to high contents of organosulfur compounds ( 11 to 35 mg / g ) . 
 thirty - three types of organosulfur compounds have been identified in garlic.16 organosulfur compounds in garlic have been shown to facilitate the detoxification of carcinogens by glutathione - s - transferase  modulate the activity of metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome p450s  and inhibit the formation of dna adducts in several target tissues.1719 antiproliferative activity of organosulfur compounds has been demonstrated in tumor cell lines including colon  prostate  and breast  which is mediated by induction of apoptosis via the caspase-3 signaling pathway and cell - cycle arrest.2021 one possible mechanism of cancer preventive effects of garlic in stomach cancer development involves its antimicrobial activities against helicobacter pylori  a major risk factor of stomach cancer.22 hot red chili pepper powder  one of the main ingredient of kimchi  contains capsaicin ( trans-8-methyl - n - vanillyl-6-nonenamide ) . 
 although the role of capsaicin in carcinogenic processes has been controversial  there is accumulated evidence that capsaicin is capable to induce apoptosis of cancer cells by generating excess reactive oxygen species.23 thoennissen et al.24 demonstrated that capsaicin caused cell - cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells by modulating the egfr / her-2 pathway and inhibited the development of pre - neoplastic breast lesions by up to 80% without toxicity . 
 in addition to each ingredient of kimchi  kimchi extract was used to investigate cancer preventive / anticarcinogenic activity of kimchi . 
 extract of kimchi fermented for 3 weeks inhibited the proliferation of human cancer cell lines ( gastric adenocarcinoma and acute promyelocytic leukemia ) . 
 leukemia cells treated with kimchi extract showed increased apoptosis and decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential.25 the juice of 3-week fermented kimchi suppressed the growth of k-562 human leukemia cells and mg-63 human osteosarcoma cells but no toxicity of kimchi juice was found in normal cells.26 sarcoma180 cells transplanted mice were treated with methanol extract of 3-week fermented kimchi . 
 animals provided kimchi extract showed in smaller tumor weight and decreased malondialdehyde formation compared to those of the control group.27 
 although there has been no general acceptance on how to define probiotic microorganisms  lactobacillus species  bifidobacterium sp  saccharomyces boulardii  and some other microbes have been thought and used as probiotic strains.28 these probiotic microorganisms have been used as food supplement in order to achieve health benefit effects of them . 
 there have been many studies reported on the functionality of lactic acid bacteria in the fermentation process of kimchi and their importance in the health beneficial effects of kimchi  including prevention of cancer.29 according to pyrosequencing analysis of commercial kimchi samples to identify kimchi lactic acid bacteria  the genus weissella was predominant at 44.4% . 
 w. koreensis was 27.2% and w. cibaria was 8.7%.7 weissella is a newly separated lactic acid bacteria of lactobacillus family that was identified by a recent dna technique . 
 it is a gram - positive and catalase negative bacteria included in geneally recognized as safe.30 the main lactic acid bacteria involved in kimchi fermentation has long been known as lactobacillus genus and leuconostoc genus  but more recently  weissella genus lactic acid bacteria has been newly separately identified.30 
 weissella is an early dominant in kimchi fermentation and produces lactic acid  acetic acid  alcohol  dextran  and co2  which account for the unique fresh taste and texture of kimchi.3132 
 weissella species found in kimchi are w. cibaria  w. koreensis  and w. hanii.12 sources of each weissella species are shown in table 1.33 w. cibaria  newly named by bjorkroth and others  has been separated from korean kimchi and various other sources  including fermented foods  greek salami  spanish sausages  and animal and human excrements . 
 w. cibaria is gram - positive  non - pore formulating  non - motile  hetero lactic acid fermented  and catalase negative bacillus  and can not produce dextran from sucrose.3435 studies have reported that microorganisms  including lactic acid bacteria  secreted exopolysaccharides ( eps ) with the anticancer  anti - inflammatory  immune modulating  and blood cholesterol declining functions.36 it was demonstrated that w. cibaria  leuconostoc mesenteroides and w. confusa are able to produce eps . among these lactic acid bacteria  w. cibaria exhibited higher production of eps which indicates more acid resistance ( table 2).37 w. cibaria was reported to have anticancer activity  immune modulating activity  anti - inflammatory activity  and antioxidant activity . based on the patent related to the w. cibaria s anticancer activity registered by cha et al.38 the anticancer activity in w. cibaria 
 w. cibaria bacteria was incubated for 24 hours in deman rogosa sharpe agar badge  diluted with phosphate buffered saline  and 10% concentration of bacteria samples were provided to normal cell strains and colorectal cancer cell strains for 72 hours . 
 cell growth was suppressed by treatment of w. cibaria in colorectal cancer cells but not in normal cells . 
 ahn et al.33 presented that the immune control effect of w. cibaria was stronger than the well - known probiotic bacterium  l. rhammosus gg ( lgg ) . 
 w. cibaria produced higher levels of nitric oxide  nuclear factor ( nf)- b  cytokines ( e.g.  interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor- ) than lgg  suggesting that w. cibaria is more effective in immune control compared to lgg . 
 furthermore  w. cibaria is known to have an antiviral function against the avian influenza virus.39 ornithine  a type of amino acid produced from its arginine precursor  is reported to accelerate growth hormone excretion and has an antiobesity effect . during the kimchi fermentation process 
  the level of arginine  an ornithine precursor  has decreased while the ornithine level increased rapidly  which suggested that kimchi is a source of ornithine . 
 moreover  a correlation between the amount of w. cibaria and the amount of ornithine in kimchi was observed.40 use of w. cibaria as a starter for food fermentation promoted the formation of ornithine from arginine  which in turn provide health beneficial effects  such as antiobesity due to high levels of ornithine in fermented food.4142 lactobacillus genus is a microorganism which does not form spores and is an anaerobic and facultative anaerobic gram - positive bacterium . 
 this bacterium is not only widely dispersed in nature but is also found in human oral cavity and digestive organs . 
 this bacterium is a beneficial microorganism that is widely used as a starter for various fermented dairy products.43 the main kimchi lactic acid bacteria of lactobacillus is l. plantarum . 
 the rapid increase of l. plantarum in the late stage of kimchi fermentation produces large amounts of organic acid  which is known as the main substance that acidifies kimchi . 
 acid tolerance of l. plantarum allows us to use this bacterium for natural antibacterial and antifungal products . 
 l. plantarum s cancer preventive potential has been tested by the ames mutation assay and the sos chromotest . when cabbage was brined with 3% 
 salt concentration and kimchi was fermented at 5c for 3 weeks  kimchi extract exerted an antimutagenic effect against aflatoxin b1.44 
 l. plantarum  isolated from kimchi  also exhibited a strong antimutagenic effect against n - methyl - n-nitro - n - nitrosoguanidine  4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide.45 furthermore  l. plantarum  isolated from kimchi  had stronger antimutagenic effects compared to lactic acid bacteria originated from fermented milk.46 the macrophagocytes provided with l. plantarum separated from kimchi strengthened phagocytosis  and displayed anticancer effects in aseites carcinoma and solid tumor due to the polysaccharide chains of muramic acid in the l. plantarum s cell well . among lactic acid bacteria s cell wall substances  polysaccharide types rather than 
 glycopeptide play a pivotal role in cancer suppression.47 to evaluate the possible use of l. plantarum as a probiotic  lee et al.48 measured the survival rate in artificial gastric fluid and intestinal fluid  adhesion compatability with human intestinal caco-2 cells  and antibacterial activity . as a result  l. plantarum strains showed more than 90% survival rate in artificial gastric fluid and intestinal fluid  and more than 400 times the survival rate of the control strain  l. casei . 
 when pathogenic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria were incubated together  l. plantarum suppressed the adhesion of intestinal crypt cells with the pathogenic bacteria  and also suppressed pathogenic bacteria growth of escherichia coli  stapylococcus aureus  and salmonella typhimurium by 93.4%  75.9%  and 69.3% respectively .

 this paper describes the cancer preventive / anti - carcinogenic potential of kimchi lactic acid bacteria  focusing on w. cibaria and l. plantarum . 
 the antibiotic tolerant probiotic presented in kimchi suppresses expression of carcinogen activating enzymes and possesses many other health benefits such as suppression of growth and development of pathogenic bacteria  intestinal regulation  and immune boosts . 
 especially  the w. cibaria and l. plantarum found in kimchi have many effects  like anti - inflammatory  immune modulating  and blood cholesterol reducing activity  which may account for their cancer preventive / anticancer potential . 
 these probiotic lactic acid bacteria in kimchi can not only be used as an antimicrobials in foods but also be implemented in developing functional foods to reduce the risk of colon cancer .","

1) Abstract: The increasing number of cancer deaths in Korea has raised concerns about the side effects of chemotherapy. Researchers are now focusing on food-derived agents with fewer side effects, such as kimchi, which contains high levels of lactic acid bacteria with chemopreventive effects. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms behind these effects.

2) Research and Discussion: Chemotherapy is known to cause damage to both cancerous and healthy cells, leading to side effects. To combat this, researchers are turning to food-derived chemopreventive and anti-tumor agents, such as kimchi, which contains lactic acid bacteria. This review specifically focuses on weissella cibaria and lactobacillus plantarum, two types of lactic acid bacteria found in kimchi, and their potential abilities to prevent cancer.

3) Results and Conclusion: Studies have shown that kimchi, a popular food in Korea, has chemopreventive effects due to its high levels of lactic acid bacteria.

"a glomangioma is a benign vascular tumor derived from the glomus body  a specialized neuromyoarterial structure involved in thermal regulation . 
 it is a subtype of the more generalized category of  glomus tumors  and should not be confused with the head and neck paragangliomas  such as the glomus tympanicum or glomus jugulare . 
 it should also be distinguished from the glomangiopericytoma  the sinonasal type hemangiopericytoma  which displays different ultrastructural and histochemical characteristics.1 glomangiomas are most commonly found subungually and are exceedingly rare in the head and neck.2 they account for only 0.6% of all nonepithelial tumors of the nasal cavity  nasopharynx  and paranasal sinuses.3 glomangiomas that induce paraneoplastic osteomalacia are even more uncommon  with only one case reported to date.4 while there are several documented cases of oncogenic osteomalacia ( oo ) caused by glomangiopericytomas5 we present the second reported case of glomangioma - induced osteomalacia and the first case documented in english . 
 a 42-year - old man with a history of unexplained hip  rib  scapula  and metatarsal fractures ; left foot pain with exercise ; and weakness presented to our clinic for evaluation of a paranasal sinus tumor . 
 the endocrinology service initially diagnosed him with tumor - induced osteomalacia caused by fibroblast growth factor 23 ( fgf23 )  which prompted an octreotide scan revealing a questionable area of enhancement in the pituitary . a subsequent magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) showed an ethmoid mass extending through the cribriform intracranially  measuring 3.9    1.9    2.4 cm at its largest dimensions ( fig . 
 the patient reported occasional sinus congestion  decreased sense of smell during the preceding 2 to 3 years and occasional blurry vision in the morning . 
 his laboratory workup revealed a significantly decreased 125-vitamin d level of less than 8 ng / ml  a decreased phosphate level to 1.6 mg / dl  a low to normal calcium level of 8.7 mg / dl  and a significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase level at 65.3 g / l . 
 preoperative mri  t1 with contrast  showing an ethmoid mass extending through the cribriform intracranially . 
 the patient underwent a combined endoscopic endonasal approach to the anterior skull base with tumor resection . the cribriform defect and intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) leak 
 pathology revealed a vascular neoplasm with a uniform cluster of ovoid cells arranged around the vessels and moderate focal nuclear enlargement ( fig . 
 tumor cells stained positive for cd31 and smooth muscle actin ( sma ) but negative for cd34  s100  and pan - cytokeratin on immunohistochemistry ( fig . 
 the patient reported near - complete resolution of bone pain and improvement in smell  and he had normalization of phosphate  alkaline phosphatase  vitamin d  and other laboratory values . 
 repeat mri showed gross total resection of the mass and no detectable recurrence ( fig . 
 4 ) . 
 postoperative mri  t1 with contrast  showing gross total resection of the mass with nasoseptal flap reconstruction of the skull base . 
 osteomalacia is a disease of the bone characterized by defective mineralization of osteoid from decreased levels of available phosphate and calcium or increased bone resorption . 
 it often presents with diffuse joint and bone pain  easy fracturing  difficulty walking  weakness  and other nonspecific symptoms . 
 oo is a rare  disabling  and curable form of osteomalacia that affects both sexes equally and usually presents around 40 years of age.6 it is not well described in glomangiomas but has been detailed several times in relation to glomangiopericytomas and other soft tissue and bone tumors  with more than 300 reported cases7 since its debut in 1947.8 it predominantly occurs in the context of mesenchymal tumors and is thought to be due to neoplastic overexpression of fgf23 . 
 this protein inactivates the sodium - phosphate pump in the proximal tubule ( prohibiting phosphate reabsorption and inducing renal phosphate wasting ) and reduces 1-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxy vitamin d.9 accordingly  common oo laboratory abnormalities include hypophosphatemia  normal or decreased calcium  decreased 125-dihydroxy vitamin d3 with resistance to vitamin d supplementation  and elevated alkaline phosphatase  which our patient exhibited . 
 tumors causing oo tend to be small  occult  and slow growing  making diagnosis remarkably difficult . 
 when other causes of osteomalacia have been ruled out and oo is suspected  clinicians should consider measuring a serum fgf23 level . 
 elevated fgf23 in this setting should then prompt full body imaging ( including hands and feet ) to expose the lesion . 
 the current imaging standard for investigation of oo is whole - body mri short tau inversion recovery ( stir).10 another commonly used modality is octreotide scintigraphy ( octreoscan )  which utilizes a radiotracer that binds to somatostatin receptors overexpressed on the causative tumor.11 once the neoplasm is localized  surgical resection with wide margins is the definitive treatment . 
 it is curative in essentially all cases and typically leads to rapid normalization of laboratory values and reversal of most clinical symptoms . 
 the nonspecific presentation of osteomalacia  the obscure nature of the tumors that cause oo  and the rarity of glomangiomas in the head and neck make this patient 's diagnosis challenging . 
 we believe this to be the second reported case of paranasal sinus glomangioma - induced osteomalacia and the first reported in english . 
 many head and neck surgeons may not be aware of its existence or consider it in their differential diagnoses of sinus tumors . this report serves to increase the awareness of this uncommon pathology so that it may be considered and treated in future cases .","

1) Abstract: This case report presents a rare case of paranasal sinus glomangioma-induced oncogenic osteomalacia, with only one other case reported in English literature. The patient underwent successful endoscopic removal of the tumor, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms.

2) Research and Discussion: Paranasal sinus glomangiomas are a rare cause of oncogenic osteomalacia, with tumor production of FGF23 leading to bone demineralization. Prior to this case, only one other instance has been reported in English literature. Endoscopic removal of the tumor is an effective treatment for this condition.

3) Results and Conclusion: The 42-year-old male patient in this case presented with weakness and multiple fractures, which were found to be caused by an ethmoid sinus glomangioma with intracranial extension. After successful endoscopic removal, the patient experienced complete resolution of symptoms and no further evidence of disease at 1-year follow-up. This case highlights the importance of considering paranasal sinus glomangiomas as a potential cause of oncogenic osteomalacia. "
"gestational trophoblastic disease describes a number of gynecologic tumors that originate in trophoblastic layer including hydatidiform mole ( complete or partial )  invasive mole  choriocarcinoma  placental site trophoblastic tumor and epitheloid trophoblastic tumor . 
 invasive mole may arise from any pregnancy event although in most cases is diagnosed after molar pregnancy . 
 overall cure rate in low risk patients is nearly 100% and in high - risk patient 90% . in rare cases  
 molar tissue traverses thickness of myometrium and leads to perforation and acute abdomen and invasive mole infrequently metastasis . 
 the best treatment option is chemotherapy ( according to stage and score with single or multiple agent ) and in patients that fertility is not the matter  hysterectomy can be done . 
 a 41 years old g3p2ab1 woman referred to firouzgar hospital 2 months after curettage of molar pregnancy with vaginal bleeding and acute abdomen . in workup  hcg 224000 miu / ml and evidence of metastasis was detected . 
 chemotherapy due to stage 3 and score 9 and surgery due to acute abdomen was done . 
 this case reported about ovarian metastasis and uterine rupture with acute abdomen and involvement of omentum in metastatic invasive mole . 
 management of this patient was successful . in follow up  she was free of disease without sequel of any kind for five years now . 
 invasive mole is penetration of molar tissue ( complete or partial mole ) into myometrium or uterine vasculature ( 1  16  19 ) . 
 pathologists mention the existence of villi in trophoblastic tissue ( 8  12 ) . locally invasive gestational trophoblastic neoplasia develops in 15% of patients and metastatic form in 4% of patients after evacuation of complete mole and infrequently after partial mole ( 2 ) . 
 hcg level ( > 100000 miu / ml )  excessive uterine enlargement  theca lutein cyst size 6 cm are considered as high risks for developing post molar tumors ( high risk mole ) ( 3 ) . 
 the most common symptom of invasive mole is persistent vaginal bleeding after evacuation of molar pregnancy ( sub involution of uterus and persistent theca lutein cyst is another symptom ) . 
 the rise in hcg titer is a laboratory test for diagnosis of invasive mole in follow up of molar pregnancy . 
 although definite diagnosis of invasive mole is based on pathology ( 8)  with hcg or radiologic diagnosis ( 9 )  invasive mole is diagnosed as well . in rare cases  
 metastasis occurred and the most common sites were lungs ( 80% ) ( 4 )  vagina ( 30% )  pelvis ( 20% )  liver ( 10% )  brain ( 10% )  bowel and kidney and spleen ( < 5% ) were other metastatic sites . 
 metastasis can occur from direct extension of another pelvic neoplasm or by hematogenous or lymphatic spread or by transcelomic dissemination . 
 possibility of metastasis to ovary is extremely rare which is even much lower than that of nongestational primary ovary choriocarcinoma with an incidence of 1 in 3.710 ( 5 ) . 
 invasive mole is curable with chemotherapy but hysterectomy decreases the need for multiple courses of chemotherapy and in patients with heavy bleeding or sepsis for control of complication and stabilization  chemotherapy is needed ( 6  11 ) . here a case with invasive mole after evacuation of molar pregnancy  presented with acute abdomen and in surgery metastasis to ovary and omentum and parametrium was detected . 
 a 41- year- old housewife woman  gravid 3 para 2 live child 2 ( all nvd ) with a last 10 years old child referred to firouzgar hospital on 24 august 2010 with a history of a dilation and curettage and 2 months of cough . on examination  she was febrile ( 38c .  tachycardia  leukocytosis ( 16000 ) and uterus was tender and enlarged . 
 vaginal bleeding persisted and second curettage was done in another hospital . at that time  chest x - ray was normal . 
 in our hospital  report of sample pathology given from first and second curettage was complete mole . 
 after molar evacuation  the patient was not monitored for weekly determination of hcg level . 
 she received antibiotics ( due to fever ) and work up for malignant trophoblastic disease or persistent gtn was done because of high hcg level ( 224000 miu / ml ) and much too enlarged uterus and involvement of the whole uterine parenchyma  which was detected on sonography ( largest tumor size in uterus was 6 cm ) . 
 thyroid function test demonstrated hyperthyroidism . in the metastatic work up  ct scan of chest and abdomen and brain was carried out . 
 ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed involvement of the left adnexa and pelvic lymphadenopathy . 
 the patient s chest ct scan showed multiple bilateral round pulmonary metastatic lesions that were 2 cm in diameter  illustrated in figure 1 . 
 pulmonary metastasis in invasive mole once the disease was diagnosed  the patient chemotherapy with ema started ( table 1 ) . 
 because of acute abdomen and severe abdominal pain and unstable vital signs with diagnosis of perforative peritonitis  the patient was taken up for emergency laparotomy . 
 due to hyperthyroid state  in induction of anesthesia   blocker agent was administered . in this patient  subtotal hysterectomy and left salpingo oophorectomy and resection of omentum were done . in gross uterus  
 uterine wall was perforated by tumoral invasion on the left side of posterior wall ( figure 2 ) . 
 enlarged uterus  ovarian metastasis  perforation of uterus  and myometrium invasion the patient was iii:9 according to figo staging and who scoring ( 7 ) the bilateral uterine parameters  the external surface of the endocervical canal and the omentum were invaded by tumors . 
 villous formation in myometrium villosity with necrosis in invasive mole this patient was treated with 4 courses of chemotherapy with ema - co . 
 after negative hcg ( < 5 )  she received an additional 3 courses of chemotherapy to reduce the relapse . 
 hcg titer was later tested monthly for1 year . when the first year of testing hcg terminated  hcg testing on a bimonthly basis for 2 years was done . 
 the patient was followed up to 5 years and after that the patient was free of tumor and the hcg was negative . 
 invasive mole with rupture of uterus and metastasis to ovary and omentum and manifestation of acute abdomen was rare ( 5 ) . according to epidemiological retrospective survey  
 invasive mole secondary to hydatidiform mole occurred in six months after evacuation ( 5  3 ) . 
 partial and complete hydatidiform mole are distinct disease processes with characteristic cytogenetic  histologic  and clinical features ( 8) . 
 ( 13 ) reported a case of invasive mole presenting as acute hemoperitoneum that was similar to the present case . 
 molar tissue can penetrate myometrium ( 9 ) and lead to uterine perforation ( 13 ) and cause vaginal bleeding due to erosion of uterine vessels ( 14  15 ) . 
 similar to atala et al.s case report in 1991(14 )  in our case  uterine perforation with acute intra peritoneal hemorrhage was seen . due to ease of entry of molar tissue into large venous lake present in myometrium and pelvis in pregnancy or trophoblastic disease metastasis of invasive mole commonly in lungs and after lungs in vagina  cervix  broad ligament ( 16  19 )  in our case metastasis to lung and ovary and omentum 
 although theca lutein cysts in high - risk mole due to high serum hcg level are seen normally  they regress spontaneously within 24 months ( 17 ) . 
 non gestational choriocarcinoma of ovary is differential diagnosis ( 5 ) but due to occurrence of metastasis to ovary in our case after molar pregnancy  this differential diagnosis was not a matter . as in a report of invasive mole in fallopian tube 
 ( 21 )  the first misdiagnosis of our case in another hospital  repeat curettage was done  although the first diagnosis could be persistent gtn . in another case report ( 15 ) from bruner  similarity with our case was seen . 
 combination chemotherapy should be continued in such cases as far as toxicity permits until the patient achieves 3 consecutive normal hcg levels ( 9  18 ) . as normal hcg levels 
 are attained  3 additional courses of chemotherapy are administered to reduce the risk of relapse . in low risk patients  one or two courses 
 are adequate ( 19 ) . in our case  3 courses of chemotherapy after normalization of hcg were done . 
 hysterectomy may be required in invasive mole in order to control vaginal bleeding and in unstable patient or in sepsis ( 6  20 ) . 
 hysterectomy is a reasonable option for patients who do not wish to preserve their fertility  but it does not prevent metastasis ( 20 ) . 
 furthermore  in patients with extensive uterine tumor  hysterectomy may substantially reduce the trophoblastic tumor burden ( 20 ) and thereby limit the need for multiple courses of chemotherapy . in our case  due to unstable and uterine rupture  hysterectomy was done but the need for chemotherapy courses was not removed and after several courses of chemotherapy with ema - co courses  it was cured . however  final diagnosis of our patient was invasive mole with metastasis to ovary and omentum and lung ( stage 3 ) and uterine rupture . 
 the patient responded to the treatment well and in follow up this patient was still fine for 5 years after definite care for metastasis invasive mole with surgery and chemotherapy . 
 an invasive mole in uterus with ovarian and omental metastasis was diagnosed and the patient was successfully treated by hysterectomy and chemotherapy and she was fine for 5 years in follow up .",".

Abstract:
Invasive mole is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease that originates from the trophoblastic layer and is responsible for most cases of localized neoplasia. It can occur after any pregnancy event, but is most commonly diagnosed after a molar pregnancy. The treatment of choice is chemotherapy, with a high cure rate in low risk patients.

Research and Discussion:
This case report discusses a rare case of invasive mole in a 41-year-old woman who presented with vaginal bleeding and acute abdomen, two months after curettage of a molar pregnancy. The patient had evidence of metastasis and stage 3 disease, and successful management required both chemotherapy and surgery. Lack of surveillance contributed to extensive morbidity.

Results and Conclusion:
Despite the rarity of this case, it highlights the importance of surveillance in patients with a history of molar pregnancy. The patient successfully underwent treatment and was free of disease for five years in follow up. With early detection and appropriate treatment, the cure rate for invasive mole is high."

 all animals received care according to the canadian council on animal care and the university of alberta health sciences animal welfare committee . 
 twelve - week - old c57bl/6 mice were placed on a standard chow / low - fat diet ( 4% kcal from lard ) or high - fat diet ( 60% kcal from lard  research diets ; d12492 ) for a 12-week period . at the end of week 12 
  animals were injected intraperitoneally every other day with the spt1 inhibitors  myriocin ( 0.5 mg / kg ) suspended in 1x pbs  l - cycloserine ( 25 mg / kg ) suspended in 1x pbs  or vehicle control for a 4-week period . at the end of the 4-week treatment protocol 
  animals were killed via intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital ( 12 mg ) in the fed state in the middle of the dark cycle . 
 tissues were excised and immediately frozen in liquid n2 . in another study  6-week - old db / db mice and their heterozygous controls ( db/+ ) ( jackson laboratories ) 
 as expected  mice fed a high - fat diet for 12 weeks became obese as indicated by a significant increase in weight gain  ( supplementary fig . 
 d ) . diet - induced insulin - resistant and lean mice were placed in a comprehensive lab animal - monitoring system ( clams ) for whole - body metabolic assessment  which demonstrated a high - fat diet  induced shift in fuel preference toward fatty acids as an oxidative energy source  indicated by the large drop in the respiratory exchange ratio ( rer ) ( supplementary fig . 
 further support for an increase in fatty acid oxidation in obese mice is seen with the increase in gastrocnemius -hydroxyacyl - coa dehydrogenase ( had ) activity ( table 1 ) . 
 contrary to previous findings ( 1617 )  we also report here that obesity induced by chronic high - fat feeding impairs whole - body oxygen consumption rates ( supplementary fig . 2c and d ) . 
 -hydroxyacyl - coa dehydrogenase ( had ) activity in gastrocnemius muscle of lean and obese mice treated with vehicle control or myriocin values reported are mol / g wet weight / min of n = 5 mice . 
 differences were determined using a two - way anova followed by bonferroni post hoc analysis . * significantly different from the low - fat counterpart . 
 after 12 weeks of low- or high - fat diet  mice were treated with either myriocin ( 0.5 mg / kg every other day ) or vehicle control . 
 after 2 weeks of treatment  we demonstrated that inhibition of spt1 with myriocin reverses diet - induced insulin resistance  as determined by glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance testing ( fig . 
 if these protective effects took place at the skeletal muscle level  a group of animals were killed at 30 min after insulin injection during the insulin tolerance test  and muscles were excised and harvested for immunoblot analysis of the insulin - signaling pathway . 
 we demonstrate that insulin stimulation of both akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( gsk3 ) phosphorylation were significantly improved in the gastrocnemius muscle of obese mice treated with myriocin ( fig .

 myriocin treatment was without effect on food intake  body weight  and plasma insulin levels  but did reduce both postprandial and fasted plasma glucose levels in obese  insulin - resistant mice ( table 2 ) . although fasting plasma insulin levels did not differ between diet - induced obesity ( dio ) mice treated with vehicle - control or myriocin  more sophisticated studies monitoring the changes in plasma insulin in response to a meal tolerance test in the obese jcr : la cp rat illustrate a significant improvement in plasma insulin control after treatment with the spt1 inhibitor  l - cycloserine ( supplementary fig . 
 3 ) . interestingly  indirect calorimetry revealed that the improved insulin sensitivity in dio mice treated with myriocin was not associated with a decrease in fatty acid oxidation and an increase in carbohydrate oxidation  as similar rer values were observed between the dio control and myriocin - treated animals ( fig .

 * p < 0.05  significantly different from the low - fat diet counterpart . in a parallel series of experiments  after 12 weeks of high - fat feeding  mice were treated with either the spt1 inhibitor  l - cycloserine ( 25 mg / kg every other day ) or vehicle control . although not as dramatic as the results observed with myriocin  at 2 weeks after treatment  we report improvements in glucose and insulin tolerance in mice treated with l - cycloserine ( supplementary fig . 
 obese  insulin - resistant mice were run on an exercise treadmill to determine exercise capacity . as expected  obese mice showed a dramatic reduction in both their treadmill time and distance when compared with their lean counterparts ( fig . 
 interestingly  treatment of obese mice for 2 weeks with myriocin reversed this reduction in exercise capacity ( fig . 3a and b ) . 
 this improvement in exercise capacity observed in obese mice treated with myriocin can be explained by enhanced whole - body oxygen consumption rates compared with their control counterparts ( fig . 
 c ) . in addition  we observed greater citrate synthase activity in gastrocnemius muscle of obese mice treated with myriocin ( fig . 
 protein expression of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor- coactivator-1 ( pgc1 )  a transcriptional coactivator that plays a key role in regulating a number of genes involved in energy metabolism ( 18 )  showed a trend toward a reduction in control - treated dio mice ( p = 0.077 ) that was not apparent in myriocin - treated dio mice ( fig . 
 furthermore  we also demonstrate that pretreatment with myriocin increases citrate synthase activity in c2c12 myotubes exposed to 1.0 mmol / l palmitate for 16 h ( fig . 
 these observations illustrate improvements in mitochondrial function  possibly explaining why exercise capacity and whole - body oxygen consumption rates were enhanced in this group .

 metabolic profiling of mice provided further insight with regards to mitochondrial function in obese  insulin - resistant mice  as control - treated dio mice had a significant increase in long - chain acyl carnitine esters versus their lean counterparts ( table 3 )  indicative of mitochondrial overload and the incomplete oxidation of fatty acids ( 19 ) . however  the accumulation of long - chain acyl carnitine esters in myriocin - treated dio mice was even greater ( table 3 ) . 
 this suggests that incomplete fatty acid oxidation rates were even more pronounced in the myriocin - treated dio mice  but these animals also had a significant reduction in short - chain acyl carnitine ester content ( table 3 )  which is consistent with long - chain acyl - coa dehydrogenase inhibition and reduced oxidation of long - chain fatty acids . 
 metabolic profiling of gastrocnemius muscle from lean and obese mice treated with either vehicle control or myriocin values reported are in pmol / mg protein from n = 6 mice . 
 differences were determined using a two - way anova followed by bonferroni post hoc analysis . * significantly different from the lf counterpart . 
 after 3 weeks of treatment with myriocin  in vivo heat production and ambulatory activity were assessed in our clams apparatus . paralleling our observations with regard to whole - body oxygen consumption rates 
  obesity caused a decline in whole - body heat production that was reversed by myriocin treatment ( supplementary fig . 
 moreover  obesity - induced insulin resistance was associated with reductions in physical activity that were not altered by myriocin treatment ( supplementary fig . 
 investigation of the lipid metabolite profile in gastrocnemius muscle demonstrated that chronic high - fat feeding increased long - chain acyl - coa  ceramide and dag content  but only a trend to an increase in tag content was observed ( fig . 
 d ) . treatment with myriocin in obese mice increased gastrocnemius tag content in comparison to their low - fat counterparts  but did not change the dio - associated rise in long - chain acyl - coa and dag content  and as expected  resulted in a dramatic reduction in ceramide content ( fig . 
 d ) . these results suggest a key role for ceramide in mediating skeletal muscle insulin resistance  and indicate that the other lipid metabolites possibly may not be as important in the insulin - resistance development . 
 further support for this statement is seen with the positive correlation between ceramide content and the area under the curve during the glucose tolerance test  whereas no correlation was observed with any of the other lipid metabolites ( fig . 
 interestingly  in a previous study  we showed that mice deficient for malonyl coa decarboxylase ( mcd/ ) are protected from obesity - induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance  which was associated with a reduction in incomplete fatty acid oxidation rates ( 19 ) . in this study 
 we show that these same mcd/ mice do not accumulate ceramide in their gastrocnemius muscle after 12 weeks of high - fat feeding ( fig . 
 6 )  although they did accumulate other lipid metabolites such as long - chain acyl - coa ( 19 ) . 
 inhibition of spt1 reduces skeletal muscle ceramide levels with no effect on other lipid metabolites .

 p < 0.05  significantly different from the high - fat diet wild - type mice . auc  area under the curve . to determine if ceramides may also be involved in genetic forms of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes  we treated leptin receptor deficient ( db / db ) mice with myriocin to see if we could prevent the progression of insulin resistance in these animals . 
 we split db / db mice at 6 weeks of age into two groups  and ensured that there were no differences in glucose tolerance before initiating treatment with myriocin ( fig . 
 both the db / db control and myriocin - treated groups experienced similar body weight increases after 2 weeks of treatment ( data not shown )  however  although the db / db control group became glucose intolerant  the db / db group treated with myriocin did not ( fig . 
 fasting blood glucose levels were also significantly lower in the db / db mice treated with myriocin  and although their response to insulin was delayed  myriocin - treated db / db mice demonstrated lower blood glucose levels at nearly all time points during an insulin tolerance test ( fig . 7d 
 f ) . placing these animals in the clams apparatus yielded a profile similar to that of the dio mice . 
 the db / db controls had a lower rer in the dark cycle than db/+ lean mice  and had lower whole - body oxygen consumption rates and ambulatory activity  but no change in overall heat production ; interestingly  myriocin treatment of db / db mice did not restore any of these altered parameters in db / db controls  except for a restoration of whole - body oxygen consumption rates during the light cycle ( fig . 
 examination of the lipid metabolite profile revealed that tag and long - chain acyl - coa levels were elevated in gastrocnemius muscle of db / db controls versus db/+ lean mice  whereas  unexpectedly  dag and ceramide levels were similar between the two groups ( fig . 
 h ) . myriocin treatment of db / db mice had no effect on tag  long - chain acyl - coa  or dag levels in gastrocnemius muscle versus db / db control mice  but did lead to a dramatic reduction in ceramide levels ( fig .

 further support for an increase in fatty acid oxidation in obese mice is seen with the increase in gastrocnemius -hydroxyacyl - coa dehydrogenase ( had ) activity ( table 1 ) . 
 contrary to previous findings ( 1617 )  we also report here that obesity induced by chronic high - fat feeding impairs whole - body oxygen consumption rates ( supplementary fig . 2c and d ) .

 after 12 weeks of low- or high - fat diet  mice were treated with either myriocin ( 0.5 mg / kg every other day ) or vehicle control . 
 after 2 weeks of treatment  we demonstrated that inhibition of spt1 with myriocin reverses diet - induced insulin resistance  as determined by glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance testing ( fig . 
 if these protective effects took place at the skeletal muscle level  a group of animals were killed at 30 min after insulin injection during the insulin tolerance test  and muscles were excised and harvested for immunoblot analysis of the insulin - signaling pathway .

 myriocin treatment was without effect on food intake  body weight  and plasma insulin levels  but did reduce both postprandial and fasted plasma glucose levels in obese  insulin - resistant mice ( table 2 ) . although fasting plasma insulin levels did not differ between diet - induced obesity ( dio ) mice treated with vehicle - control or myriocin  more sophisticated studies monitoring the changes in plasma insulin in response to a meal tolerance test in the obese jcr : la cp rat illustrate a significant improvement in plasma insulin control after treatment with the spt1 inhibitor  l - cycloserine ( supplementary fig .

 although not as dramatic as the results observed with myriocin  at 2 weeks after treatment  we report improvements in glucose and insulin tolerance in mice treated with l - cycloserine ( supplementary fig . 
 obese  insulin - resistant mice were run on an exercise treadmill to determine exercise capacity . as expected  obese mice showed a dramatic reduction in both their treadmill time and distance when compared with their lean counterparts ( fig . 
 interestingly  treatment of obese mice for 2 weeks with myriocin reversed this reduction in exercise capacity ( fig . 3a and b ) . 
 this improvement in exercise capacity observed in obese mice treated with myriocin can be explained by enhanced whole - body oxygen consumption rates compared with their control counterparts ( fig .

 metabolic profiling of mice provided further insight with regards to mitochondrial function in obese  insulin - resistant mice  as control - treated dio mice had a significant increase in long - chain acyl carnitine esters versus their lean counterparts ( table 3 )  indicative of mitochondrial overload and the incomplete oxidation of fatty acids ( 19 ) . however  the accumulation of long - chain acyl carnitine esters in myriocin - treated dio mice was even greater ( table 3 ) . 
 this suggests that incomplete fatty acid oxidation rates were even more pronounced in the myriocin - treated dio mice  but these animals also had a significant reduction in short - chain acyl carnitine ester content ( table 3 )  which is consistent with long - chain acyl - coa dehydrogenase inhibition and reduced oxidation of long - chain fatty acids .

 after 3 weeks of treatment with myriocin  in vivo heat production and ambulatory activity were assessed in our clams apparatus . paralleling our observations with regard to whole - body oxygen consumption rates 
  obesity caused a decline in whole - body heat production that was reversed by myriocin treatment ( supplementary fig . 
 moreover  obesity - induced insulin resistance was associated with reductions in physical activity that were not altered by myriocin treatment ( supplementary fig . 
 investigation of the lipid metabolite profile in gastrocnemius muscle demonstrated that chronic high - fat feeding increased long - chain acyl - coa  ceramide and dag content  but only a trend to an increase in tag content was observed ( fig . 
 d ) . treatment with myriocin in obese mice increased gastrocnemius tag content in comparison to their low - fat counterparts  but did not change the dio - associated rise in long - chain acyl - coa and dag content  and as expected  resulted in a dramatic reduction in ceramide content ( fig . 
 d ) . these results suggest a key role for ceramide in mediating skeletal muscle insulin resistance  and indicate that the other lipid metabolites possibly may not be as important in the insulin - resistance development . 
 further support for this statement is seen with the positive correlation between ceramide content and the area under the curve during the glucose tolerance test  whereas no correlation was observed with any of the other lipid metabolites ( fig . 
 h ) . interestingly  in a previous study  we showed that mice deficient for malonyl coa decarboxylase ( mcd/ ) are protected from obesity - induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance  which was associated with a reduction in incomplete fatty acid oxidation rates ( 19 ) . in this study 
 we show that these same mcd/ mice do not accumulate ceramide in their gastrocnemius muscle after 12 weeks of high - fat feeding ( fig .

 to determine if ceramides may also be involved in genetic forms of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes  we treated leptin receptor deficient ( db / db ) mice with myriocin to see if we could prevent the progression of insulin resistance in these animals . 
 we split db / db mice at 6 weeks of age into two groups  and ensured that there were no differences in glucose tolerance before initiating treatment with myriocin ( fig . 
 both the db / db control and myriocin - treated groups experienced similar body weight increases after 2 weeks of treatment ( data not shown )  however  although the db / db control group became glucose intolerant  the db / db group treated with myriocin did not ( fig . 
 fasting blood glucose levels were also significantly lower in the db / db mice treated with myriocin  and although their response to insulin was delayed  myriocin - treated db / db mice demonstrated lower blood glucose levels at nearly all time points during an insulin tolerance test ( fig . 
 f ) . placing these animals in the clams apparatus yielded a profile similar to that of the dio mice . 
 the db / db controls had a lower rer in the dark cycle than db/+ lean mice  and had lower whole - body oxygen consumption rates and ambulatory activity  but no change in overall heat production ; interestingly  myriocin treatment of db / db mice did not restore any of these altered parameters in db / db controls  except for a restoration of whole - body oxygen consumption rates during the light cycle ( fig . 
 examination of the lipid metabolite profile revealed that tag and long - chain acyl - coa levels were elevated in gastrocnemius muscle of db / db controls versus db/+ lean mice  whereas  unexpectedly  dag and ceramide levels were similar between the two groups ( fig .

 our results show that inhibition of spt1 reduces de novo ceramide synthesis in muscle  which has novel effects on whole - body energy metabolism and is associated with a profound reversal of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance induced by chronic high - fat feeding . 
 furthermore  we show that these improvements are dissociated from the other lipid metabolites believed to play a role in the development of insulin resistance . 
 interestingly  obesity - induced insulin resistance in mice is associated with a detriment in aerobic exercise capacity and whole - body oxygen consumption rates  both of which are partially reversed via spt1 inhibition . 
 previous studies have postulated that skeletal muscle insulin resistance is caused by the intramyocellular cytosolic accumulation of lipid metabolites ( tag  long - chain acyl - coa  dag  ceramide  etc . ) 
 in particular  long - chain acyl - coa and dag have received considerable attention because of their ability to activate the classic / novel protein kinase c signaling cascade  which can phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate proteins on serine residues  preventing their activation via the insulin receptor ( 4582123 ) . 
 it is important to note  however  that most ( 95% ) acyl - coa esters are located inside the mitochondria ( 2425 )  suggesting that if long - chain acyl - coa accumulation does play a role toward insulin resistance development  it is possible that mitochondrial  as opposed to cytosolic long - chain acyl - coa  is the primary contributor . 
 although tag has been shown in numerous studies to be elevated in muscle in association with the development of insulin resistance  recent studies have shown that tag may actually serve as a buffer  protecting the muscle against the accumulation of the more reactive lipid metabolite species ( 1011 ) . in regards to ceramide  data are mixed with its role in insulin resistance development  because in some studies  ceramide accumulation is not evident in muscle ( 526 )  and in other studies where accumulation does occur  the relative increase in the ceramide pool is not that large ( 1227 ) . 
 ( 12 ) has shed some light on this issue  as they demonstrated that ceramide accumulation in muscle is dependent on the type of diet fed to the animals . in 
 particular  saturated fatty acids drive de novo ceramide synthesis in muscle via spt1  whereas unsaturated fatty acids cause insulin resistance via other mechanisms ( 12 ) . 
 such findings may potentially explain why ceramide accumulation is not observed in studies of insulin resistance where the model employed is a lipid infusion that consists primarily of unsaturated fatty acids ( 22 ) . 
 furthermore  holland et al . ( 12 ) showed in their study that preventing de novo synthesis of ceramide via spt1 inhibition with myriocin prevented the development of glucose intolerance in obese zucker rats  and prevented the palmitate - induced inhibition of insulin - stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in isolated soleus muscle . 
 ( 28 ) also reported positive findings with myriocin treatment in leptin - deficient and dio mice  providing further support that ceramide plays a key role in the development of insulin resistance . 
 interestingly  these authors also observed a weight loss effect due to myriocin treatment that we did not observe in our studies . 
 however  the authors in this study used a much longer treatment than ours ( 8 vs. 4 weeks )  and noted that they did not observe a weight loss effect until later in the treatment period . 
 furthermore  3 weeks of myriocin treatment in dio mice improved hyperglycemia and whole - body oxygen consumption rates in their mice  despite no change in body weight compared with control - treated dio mice  which is consistent with our results in dio mice treated with myriocin for 2 weeks . 
 yang et al . also observed a dramatic reduction in hepatic steatosis that is consistent with our observations in regards to hepatic tag content . 
 our study adds further support to the studies examining the role of ceramide in mediating insulin resistance ( 1228 ) by illustrating the potential for targeting spt1 as a treatment against insulin resistance . 
 . moreover  by examining other lipid metabolites such as tag  dag  long - chain acyl - coa  and acyl carnitine content in skeletal muscle  we are able to discern important differences with regard to the relative importance of each metabolite toward the development of skeletal mucle insulin resistance . 
 importantly  reductions in skeletal muscle ceramide accumulation may represent a potential explanation for the  exercise paradox  observed in humans . 
 dube et al . ( 15 ) showed that obese  insulin - resistant men placed on an aerobic exercise training regime have elevated intramyocellular lipid and tag stores . however  marked reductions in muscle ceramide levels are observed  which may explain the enhanced insulin sensitivity of these men . 
 moreover  bruce et al . ( 14 ) showed that the improved insulin sensitivity observed with exercise training in humans is associated with a drop in muscle ceramide levels  and in particular  the saturated species . 
 ( 29 ) showed that exercise training of rats leads to a dramatic drop in the saturated species of ceramide in muscle  which is associated with an enhanced 2-deoxyglucose uptake . 
 in addition  mice overexpressing diacylglycerol acyl transferase in muscle are protected from high - fat - diet 
 induced insulin resistance and palmitate inhibition of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in isolated muscle  both of which are associated with an elevation of muscle tag and drop in ceramide levels ( 10 ) . 
 our results support these studies  as we show that obese  insulin - resistant mice treated with myriocin had significant increases in intramyocellular tag  long - chain acyl - coa  and dag  but a dramatic drop in ceramide content . 
 moreover  we observed a positive correlation with ceramide content and glucose intolerance  but not with any of the other lipid metabolites . 
 we believe that with this finding  in the setting of obesity  that ceramide may be more vital to the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance than the other lipid metabolites . 
 support for this statement is also evident in culture models of ceramide accumulation  whereby inhibition of spt1 was able to prevent palmitate - induced insulin resistance in both human and rat l6 myotubes  despite elevated tag and dag levels ( 1113 ) . 
 furthermore  a recent study in humans demonstrated that insulin resistant muscle is associated with elevated ceramide content  but no change in dag content ( 30 ) . 
 nonetheless  it is also important to note that our measurement of dag assessed total cellular levels of dag  and it is possible that differences in plasma membrane dag were significantly reduced via myriocin treatment . because dag at the membrane is believed to be the specific dag pool responsible for mediating skeletal muscle insulin resistance ( 3 )  it will be important for future studies to investigate this in more detail . 
 one of the most surprising findings of this study was that chronic high - fat feeding resulted in a dramatic decline in whole - body oxygen consumption rates . 
 the majority of studies that have examined the effect of high - fat feeding on whole - body oxygen consumption rates via use of the clams apparatus have reported elevations in oxygen consumption rates ( 1617 ) . 
 although the differences between these studies and ours could be due to the duration or composition of the diet  we propose two possible explanations for this observation of ours . 
 first  it has been reported that obesity - induced insulin resistance causes mitochondrial dysfunction that results from an impairment of fatty acid oxidative capacity ( 58 ) . although it may be possible that our model of insulin resistance is inducing mitochondrial dysfunction  it is highly unlikely due to impairments in muscle fatty acid oxidative capacity  as the rer values in obese mice reported in this study are very close to 0.7  indicating that these animals have no trouble utilizing fat as an energy source . 
 nonetheless  other factors  such as mitochondrial content  protein expression of electron transport chain ( etc ) complexes  or activity of these complexes  may account for potential mitochondrial dysfunction and the subsequent impairment of oxygen consumption rates observed in obese mice ( 3132 ) . 
 however  we did not observe differences in protein expression of cytochrome c of the etc in any group ( data not shown ) . 
 second  and just as relevant to the findings of this study  is that obesity - induced insulin resistance has been associated with elevated rates of incomplete fatty acid oxidation  which can arise when rates of fatty acid oxidation are disconnected from tca cycle activity ( 193334 ) . 
 this disconnect arises due to the sedentary nature of obese individuals and animals  thus there is no demand for the tca cycle to upregulate its activity to deal with the increased fatty acid supply that is being utilized as an energy source ( 193334 ) . 
 if the tca cycle is unable to accommodate the increasing acetyl coa coming from fatty acid oxidation  reducing equivalents such as nadh and fadh2 would not donate their electrons to the complexes of the etc  accounting for the reduction in oxygen consumption rates . 
 our observation of increased accumulation of long - chain acyl carnitine esters in the muscle of dio mice is thus consistent with elevated rates of incomplete fatty acid oxidation . 
 in contrast  there was an even greater accumulation of long - chain acyl carnitine esters in myriocin - treated dio mice  which at first glance would suggest even greater rates of incomplete fatty acid oxidation in these animals . 
 however  myriocin - treated dio mice actually had a significant reduction in the content of a number of short - chain acyl carnitine esters  and this  in combination with the rise of long - chain acyl carnitine esters  is suggestive of long - chain acyl - coa dehydrogenase and subsequent long - chain fatty acid oxidation inhibition ( 35 ) . 
 another piece of indirect support for fatty acid oxidation inhibition with myriocin treatment in dio mice is the observation that tag accumulated in the muscle of these animals versus their lean counterparts  but not in control - treated dio mice versus their lean counterparts . 
 a reduction in fatty acid oxidation - derived nadh would decrease nadh / nadph oxidase activity and subsequent superoxide production in myriocin - treated dio mice  which would contribute toward their improved mitochondrial function . 
 this improvement in mitochondrial function  coupled together with improvements in glucose metabolism and glucose - derived acetyl coa production for the tca cycle  may contribute to the greater oxygen consumption rates in these animals . 
 obesity - induced decrements in pgc1 protein expression might also explain impairments in mitochondrial function ( 343637 )  and although not significant  we observed a trend toward a reduction in gastrocnemius pgc1 protein expression in control - treated dio mice ( p = 0.077 ) that was not evident in myriocin - treated dio mice . 
 interestingly  citrulline levels were increased in myriocin - treated dio mice versus their control counterparts ( supplementary fig . 
 a previous study in humans showed that supplementation of citrulline enhances aerobic oxidative metabolism ( 38 )  supporting our findings of increased whole - body oxygen consumption rates and greater exercise time in myriocin - treated dio mice . 
 how myriocin and subsequent spt1 inhibition would influence skeletal muscle citrulline levels is currently unknown  but is undoubtedly an intriguing avenue for future investigation . 
 in addition  we have previously shown that mcd/ mice ( a genetic model of fatty acid oxidation deficiency ) are protected from obesity - induced insulin resistance . 
 interestingly  we show in this study that these exact same animals do not accumulate ceramide in their muscle after 12 weeks of high - fat feeding  leading to the very intriguing possibility that intramyocellular ceramide accumulation is linked to the mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation rates observed in insulin resistance . 
 a limitation with our interpretation of whole - body oxygen consumption rates is that  unlike human studies  we were unable to normalize our oxygen consumption rates to lean body mass . 
 it is entirely possible that whole - body oxygen consumption rates were simply lower in dio mice because of a significant increase in overall adiposity  due to fat mass having a lower metabolic rate than lean body mass . 
 however  the fact that adiposity and body weight were similar between myriocin- and control - treated dio mice suggests that this would not be a contributing factor to the higher oxygen consumption rates observed in the myriocin - treated dio mice . 
 although we believe that the changes accounting for the greater oxygen consumption rates in myriocin - treated dio mice primarily reflect the muscle  we can not ignore possible contributions from changes in other peripheral tissues  such as brown adipose tissue and uncoupling protein activity . 
 the beneficial effects mediated by inhibition of spt1 and prevention of de novo ceramide synthesis could also arise from liver effects in our animals . 
 regardless  we did not observe increases in hepatic ceramide content after diet - induced obesity  and myriocin treatment had no effect on insulin - stimulated akt and gsk3 phosphorylation in obese mice versus their respective controls ( supplementary fig . 
  recent studies have also shown that high - fat feeding does not increase ceramide content in the liver ( 39 )  and increases in hepatic ceramide content via genetic overexpression of either dgat1 or dgat2 does not result in any type of insulin resistance or inflammation ( 40 ) . 
 moreover  we reported no difference during a pyruvate challenge of fasted  obese  control- or myriocin - treated mice ( supplementary fig . 8)  suggesting that gluconeogenic capacity was not different between the two groups and that the liver likely does not play a key role with the improved insulin sensitivity observed in myriocin - treated mice . 
 regardless  we can not entirely rule out the possibility that the liver plays a role with the benefit observed during myriocin treatment  as the dio - associated rise in hepatic tag content was reversed via myriocin treatment  and thus it will be important for future studies to delineate the role of hepatic spt1 in greater depth . 
 finally  chronic low - grade inflammation has been shown in a number of studies to play a role in causing obesity - induced insulin resistance ( 4143 ) . 
 inflammatory and stress kinases  such as p38 mapk and jnk  have been proposed to be downstream mediators of this inflammatory effect  as inhibitors of both kinases are able to prevent high - fat diet  induced insulin resistance ( 94446 ) . unexpectedly  
 the phosphorylation status of both p38 mapk and jnk was not altered by dio  nor was it altered by myriocin treatment ( supplementary fig . 
 9 )  suggesting that inflammation may not play as vital a role in our model of insulin resistance . 
 it may also be possible that inflammation in our model is mediated by some other kinase  such as ikk ( 4748 ) . with regard to the findings in db / db mice  
 we report very similar findings to what we observed in the obesity - induced insulin - resistant mice  and that treatment with myriocin also yielded a very similar beneficial profile . 
 interestingly  gastrocnemius ceramide levels  although reduced in myriocin - treated db / db mice  did not differ between db/+ lean and db / db control mice . 
 this suggests  at least in this model  that perhaps ceramide metabolites  such as glucosylceramide  are more important in mediating skeletal muscle insulin resistance than ceramide itself ( 49 ) . 
 furthermore  the ceramide pool is under a dynamic process of synthesis and degradation ( 9 )  and although de novo synthesis of ceramide may be increased in these animals  a simultaneous increase in ceramide degradation would mask out any noticeable change . in summary  we show that ceramide accumulation in skeletal muscle plays a key role during obesity - induced insulin resistance  whereas the other lipid metabolites  such as tag  long - chain acyl - coa  and dag  may not be as vital . 
 importantly  inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis has novel effects on whole - body energy metabolism and is sufficient to reverse obesity - induced whole - body glucose intolerance and insulin resistance . 
 furthermore  whole - body oxygen consumption rates and exercise capacity in obese mice are improved via inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis . 
 last  our finding that muscle ceramide levels are not elevated in db / db mice  but that inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis still prevents their development of insulin resistance  suggests the possibility that ceramide metabolites may also play a role in the progression of this disease .

Abstract:
The accumulation of intramyocellular lipid metabolites, specifically diacylglycerol and ceramide, has been proposed as a potential cause of skeletal muscle insulin resistance. This study aimed to determine the role of de novo ceramide synthesis in mediating muscle insulin resistance and found a strong correlation between ceramide accumulation and insulin resistance.

Research and Discussion:
Mice were fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity and then treated with myriocin, an inhibitor of de novo ceramide synthesis. The treatment resulted in a significant decrease in intramyocellular ceramide levels, reversal of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, as well as enhanced insulin signaling. These findings suggest that inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis could be a promising treatment for insulin resistance.

Results and Conclusion:
The study concluded that the accumulation of ceramide plays a significant role in the development of insulin resistance. Inhibition of serine palmitoyl transferase-1, the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo ceramide synthesis, effectively reversed insulin resistance and improved insulin signaling in mice fed a high-fat diet. These results suggest that targeting de novo ceramide synthesis may be a potential strategy for treating insulin resistance. "

 cd36-[hrp ] was purchased from novus biologicals  and human recombinant insulin ( novolin ) from novo nordisk canada . 
 this study was performed with the approval of the university of alberta animal policy and welfare committee . 
 experiments were carried out on male wild - type ( c57bl6 ) and cd36 knockout ( ko ) mice ( 19 ) maintained in a temperature - controlled room with a reversed 12-h light/12-h dark cycle .

 to determine whether an age - related decline in resting metabolic rate and energy expenditure might contribute to the development of insulin resistance  c57bl6 mice of 1214 ( young ) or 5258 ( middle - aged ) weeks of age were analyzed using indirect calorimetry . as mice aged and body weight was increased ( fig . 
 1a )  substrate use was altered slightly  with reductions in rer indicating that middle - aged mice used more fatty acid throughout the day compared with young mice ( fig . 
 in addition  significant reductions in oxygen consumption ( vo2 ) ( fig . 1c ) and carbon dioxide production ( vco2 ) ( fig . 
 1d ) were observed during both the dark ( active ) and light ( inactive ) phases in middle - aged mice compared with young mice . 
 1e ) was decreased in middle - aged mice compared with young mice  whereas activity measurements were not significantly different between age - groups ( fig . 
 our data indicate that middle - aged mice have a lower metabolic rate than young mice and that this might increase susceptibility to weight gain  obesity  and metabolic disease . 
 body weight of young ( 1214 weeks of age ) and middle - aged ( 5258 weeks of age ) mice fed a standard laboratory diet ( a ) . 
 indirect calorimetry was performed to measure respiratory exchange ratio ( rer ) ( b )  vo2 ( c )  vco2 ( d )  and heat production adjusted for bodyweight ( e ) ; total activity ( f ) was measured in both the dark ( active ) and light ( inactive ) phases . 
 p < 0.05 indicates comparisons performed between young and middle - aged mice in either dark or light phases ( mann - whitney u test ) . 
 two - way anova was performed for rer ( b ) and indicated the main effect for age ( p < 0.01 ) . 
 given that skeletal muscle metabolism contributes to whole - body basal metabolic rate  we addressed whether skeletal muscle metabolism was depressed in middle - aged mice by assessing the activities of two enzymes involved in regulating mitochondrial metabolism . 
 2a ) was elevated in the middle - aged compared with the young mice  and citrate synthase ( fig . 
 2b ) followed a similar upward trend  suggesting that -oxidation and tca cycle activity were not directly compromised in the middle - aged mice . since mitochondrial number ( fig . 
 2c ) or function did not appear to be altered at middle age  we next assessed whether peroxisome proliferator  activated receptor ( ppar) responsive genes or molecular signaling cascades known to regulate skeletal muscle fatty acid flux and fatty acid entry into the mitochondria were associated with this overall reduction in whole - body basal metabolic rate observed in middle age . 
 although a more comprehensive assessment of the multiple mediators of fatty acid utilization may reveal additional mechanisms  we did not observe any changes in protein levels of known ppar responsive genes involved in lipid metabolism  including malonyl - coa decarboxylase and acyl - coa synthetase 1 ( data not shown ) . as a result 
  we also examined the energy - sensing kinase  ampk  which is known for its ability to govern energy metabolism ( 23 ) . in agreement with previous reports using older rodents ( 2425 )  levels of phosphorylated ampk 
 were significantly reduced in skeletal muscle of middle - aged mice compared with young mice ( fig . 
 moreover  the phosphorylation status of acetyl coa carboxylase ( acc )  the downstream target of ampk that indirectly regulates fatty acid entry into the mitochondria and ultimately -oxidation  was significantly decreased in skeletal muscle from middle - aged mice ( fig . 
 although reduced ampk phosphorylation could be the result of impaired activity of upstream ampk kinases or increased ampk phosphatase activity  it is currently unknown which of these contributes to reduced ampk phosphorylation in our model . 
 however  consistent with decreased energy expenditure  increased adiposity  and reduced ampk activity in skeletal muscle from middle - aged mice  the levels of skeletal muscle triglycerides were significantly elevated in middle - aged mice compared with young mice ( fig . 
 2 g ) . given that lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle has been proposed in rodents ( 26 ) and humans ( 172728 ) to be one of the primary causes of skeletal muscle insulin resistance  we next investigated whether glucose tolerance was impaired in middle - aged mice . despite elevated intramuscular triglycerides ( fig . 2 g ) and impaired basal and insulin - stimulated akt phosphorylation ( fig . 
 2h and i  respectively ) in skeletal muscle of middle - aged mice  whole - body glucose tolerance ( fig . 
 2k ) were not different in middle - aged compared with young mice  suggesting that age - induced alterations in skeletal muscle fatty acid handling and increased triglyceride storage precede the development of insulin resistance and metabolic disease . 
 alterations in fatty acid handling and reduced insulin signaling in skeletal muscle of middle - aged mice do not result in impaired whole - body glucose tolerance . 
 activity of two mitochondrial enzymes -had ( a ) and citrate synthase ( cs ) ( b ) was determined in gastrocnemius muscle from overnight fasted young ( 1214 weeks of age ) and middle - aged ( 5258 weeks of age ) mice . 
 immunoblot analysis using a total oxphos complex antibody cocktail was performed in gastrocnemius muscle lysates  and immunoblots were normalized against tubulin as a control for protein loading ( c ) . 
 phosphorylation status of ampk at threonine 172 ( d ) and acc at serine 79 ( f ) was detected using immunoblot analysis with phospho - specific antibodies . 
 immunoblots were quantified by densitometry and normalized against total protein levels of ampk ( e ) and acc ( f ) . 
 triglyceride ( tg ) levels ( g ) and phosphorylation status of akt ( h ) were determined in gastrocnemius muscle from overnight - fasted young and middle - aged mice . 
 gastrocnemius muscle was collected from a separate group of overnight - fasted young and middle - aged mice following intraperitoneal injection with either saline or human recombinant insulin ( 10 units / kg )  and immunoblots were performed to detect phosphorylation status of akt at serine 473 in gastrocnemius muscle lysates ( i ) . glucose tolerance test ( j ) 
 was performed in young (  ) and middle - aged (  ) mice following a 6-h fast . 
 serum insulin was detected in young and middle - aged mice after an overnight fast ( k ) . 
 p < 0.05 indicates comparisons performed between young and middle - aged mice ( mann - whitney u test ) . 
 since we speculated that middle - aged mice are more susceptible than young mice to the development of insulin resistance  young and middle - aged mice were subjected to high - fat feeding for 12 weeks . although young mice fed a high - fat diet displayed weight gain ( fig . 
 3a ) and signs of glucose intolerance compared with young mice fed a low - fat diet ( fig . 
 in contrast  middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet showed significant weight gain ( body weight : low fat  30.18  0.70 g  high fat  55.14  1.56 g ; p < 0.05 ) and displayed dramatically elevated insulin levels ( fig . 
 in addition  whole - body glucose tolerance in the middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet was significantly impaired compared with that in middle - aged mice fed a low - fat diet ( fig . 
 although activation of insulin signaling  as determined by the phosphorylation status of akt is not impaired in skeletal muscle of young ( fig . 
 3j ) mice fed a high - fat diet compared with that in mice fed a low - fat diet  this is likely due to elevated levels of circulating insulin ( fig . 
 3e and f ) observed in the respective high - fat groups . in support of the glucose tolerance data  homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance values were significantly higher in the high - fat  fed middle - aged mice ( fig . 
 3k )  suggesting that high - fat feeding induces more dramatic insulin resistance in middle - aged mice than in young mice . 
 interestingly  young mice on a high - fat diet were of the same weight as middle - aged mice on a low - fat diet ; yet  only the young mice on a high - fat diet had impaired glucose disposal ( data not shown ) . 
 although we can not discriminate between the effects of aging and increased adiposity because these variables coassociate  our findings do suggest that the increased weight gain associated with aging is not sufficient to alter whole - body glucose disposal and that other factors such as high - fat diet are likely involved . aging increases the susceptibility to the development of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in mice fed a high - fat diet . 
 body weights ( a )  fed and fasted blood glucose ( b )  glucose tolerance test ( c )  and phosphorylation status of akt ( d ) were measured in gastrocnemius muscle from young ( 1214 weeks of age ) mice following 12 weeks of high fat ( hf ) feeding . 
 serum insulin levels in the fasted ( e ) and fed ( f ) states obtained from young ( 1214 weeks of age ) and middle - aged ( 4852 weeks of age ) mice fed a low - fat ( lf ) and high - fat diet for 12 weeks .

 homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( homa - ir ) as a surrogate marker of insulin resistance in young and middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet ( k ) . 
 immunoblot analysis using anti - cd36 antibody was performed in gastrocnemius muscle lysates from middle - aged mice fed a low- and high - fat diet  and immunoblots were quantified by densitometry and normalized against tubulin as a control for protein loading ( l ) . 
 triglyceride ( tg ) ( m )  long - chain acyl - coa ( lccoa ) ( n )  and c18 ceramide ( o ) levels in gastrocnemius muscle from overnight - fasted middle - aged mice fed a low- or high - fat diet . 
 two - way anova was performed to detect main effects of age  diet  and age  diet interactions on insulin levels ( e and f ) and homa - ir ( k ) . 
 significant effect of age  diet  and age  diet interaction ( p < 0.05 ) was observed for e  f  and k. * p < 0.05 indicates comparisons performed between young and middle - aged mice or between low- and high - fat fed mice in fed or fasted state ( mann - whitney u test ) . because high - fat diet  induced insulin resistance in young rodents is associated with an increased efficiency of fatty acid uptake into skeletal muscle ( 26 )  protein expression of cd36  a protein that facilitates fatty acid transport  was determined in skeletal muscle of mice fed a high - fat diet . 
 consistent with previous publications in young mice ( 262930 )  we observed a modest increase in cd36 protein expression in the muscle of young mice fed a high - fat diet  as well as an increase in intramuscular triglyceride levels ( data not shown ) . consistent with our hypothesis  cd36 expression was significantly elevated in skeletal muscle of middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet compared with that in mice fed a low - fat diet ( fig . 
 increased cd36 protein expression  skeletal muscle triglyceride levels were significantly elevated in high - fat  fed middle - aged mice compared with those in low - fat  fed mice ( fig . 
 3 m )  as were long - chain acyl - coa esters ( fig . 
  these data suggest that increased cd36-mediated fatty acid transport may contribute to lipid accumulation and impaired insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle of middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet . 
 to investigate whether inhibition of fatty acid transport into the skeletal muscle could alter the observed responses of a middle - aged mouse to a high - fat diet  we utilized the cd36 ko mouse  which has skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake rates 4070% of those in wild - type mice ( 3132 ) . 
 interestingly  there was a striking difference in weight gain between middle - aged wild - type and cd36 ko mice following 12 weeks of high - fat feeding ( fig . 
 4a )  with middle - aged cd36 ko mice accumulating 51% less weight than the wild - type mice over the same period of time ( fig . 
 4d ) between groups could not account for this dramatic change in weight gain  indirect calorimetry indicated that energy expenditure ( fig . 
 4 g ) were significantly increased in middle - aged cd36 ko mice fed a high - fat diet compared with those in high - fat  fed middle - aged wild - type mice . 
 although this increased activity in the middle - aged cd36 ko mouse fed a high - fat diet could be attributed to the absence of obesity  heat production was also increased in middle - aged cd36 ko mice fed a low - fat diet compared with that in low - fat  fed middle - aged wild - type mice ( fig . 
 4h ) and in high - fat  fed middle - aged ko mice when normalized for body weight ( fig .

 ( a high - quality digital representation of this figure is available in the online issue . ) to gain a more comprehensive metabolic assessment of muscle metabolism in middle - aged wild - type and cd36 ko mice fed a low - fat or high - fat diet  we used mass spectrometry to measure a broad range of intermediary metabolites  including acylcarnitines of various chain lengths  organic acids  and amino acids 
 . acylcarnitines are by - products of fuel catabolism that respond to changes in substrate availability or flux limitations at specific mitochondrial enzymes ( 143334 ) . 
 middle - aged cd36 ko mice fed a low - fat diet had elevated levels of acetyl - carnitine ( c2 )  and -hydroxybutyryl - carnitine ( c4oh ) compared with their wild - type counterparts ( supplemental fig . 1a and supplemental table 1 ) . whereas several short - chain acylcarnitine species  including c2 and c4oh  as well as propionyl - carnitine ( c3 ) and succinyl - carnitine ( c4dc )  tended to increase in response to a high - fat diet 
  these same metabolites trended downward in cd36 ko mice fed a high - fat diet ( supplemental fig . 1a and supplemental table 1 ) . 
 in addition  several long - chain acylcarnitine species were reduced in muscle from wild - type mice fed a high - fat diet while at the same time levels of hydroxylated long - chain acylcarnitine ( lcoh ) species were increased  resulting in a robust increase in the long - chain  to  lcoh acylcarnitine ratio ( fig . 
 c ) . given that long - chain acylcarnitines accumulate when their production by mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyl transferase ( cpt)1 exceeds flux through -oxidation enzymes  such as long - chain acyl - coa dehydrogenase ( lcad ) and -had ( 35 )  this pattern is consistent with a diet - induced shift in flux limitation from lcad to -had . 
 notably  levels of many long - chain and lcoh acylcarnitines were lower in the cd36 ko mice fed a high - fat diet than in the wild - type mice fed a high - fat diet ( fig . 5a ; supplemental table 1 ) . 
 the organic acids were less responsive to both diet and genotype  although subtle changes were detected in succinate  fumarate  and citrate levels ( supplemental fig . 
 muscle levels of amino acids were higher in wild - type mice fed a low - fat diet but were dramatically decreased following high - fat feeding . by comparison  
 amino acid levels remained unchanged in cd36 ko mice in response to a high - fat diet ( supplemental fig . 
 although these metabolite measurements do not fully characterize mitochondrial substrate flux  together the data suggest that ablation of cd36 not only alters baseline mitochondrial and intermediary metabolism but also significantly impacts the muscle response to lipid exposure . altered skeletal muscle lipid handling prevents development of insulin resistance in middle - aged cd36 ko mice fed a high - fat ( hf ) diet for 12 weeks . 
 acylcarnitine levels were measured in gastrocnemius muscle from overnight - fasted middle - aged ( 4852 weeks of age ) wild - type ( wt ) and cd36 ko mice fed a low- ( lf ) or high - fat diet for 12 weeks . 
 levels of individual long chain ( lc ) and lcoh species ( a )  the sum total of all long - chain or lcoh species ( b )  and the ratio of total lcoh  to  long - chain species ( c ) . 
 phosphorylation status of ampk ( thr172 ) ( d ) and acc ( ser 79 ) ( e ) was detected in gastrocnemius muscle using immunoblot analysis . 
 immunoblots were quantified by densitometry and normalized against total ampk ( d ) and acc ( e ) . 
 serum levels of free fatty acids ( ffas ) from high - fat  fed wild - type and cd36 ko mice were determined after 12 weeks of diet ( f ) . 
 intramuscular levels of triglyceride ( tg ) ( g )  lccoa ( h )  and c18 ceramide ( i ) were determined in gastrocnemius muscle obtained from wild - type and ko mice fed a high - fat diet for 12 weeks . 
 glucose tolerance testing ( j ) was performed in high - fat  fed wild - type and ko mice fasted for 6 h. fasted blood glucose ( k ) and serum insulin ( l ) levels obtained from middle - aged wild - type and ko mice fed a high - fat diet for 12 weeks .

 immunoblots were performed on gastrocnemius muscle isolated from middle - aged wild - type and ko mice following high - fat diet and phosphorylation status of akt measured and normalized to total akt levels ( n ) . 
 main effects of genotype  diet  and genotype  diet interactions on acylcarnitine levels ( a  c ) were detected by two - way anova . for simplicity  
 symbols indicate metabolites that were affected by genotype  diet  or a genotype - diet interaction . 
 detailed results of the statistical analysis for all acylcarnitine species are presented in supplemental table 1 . 
 * p < 0.05 indicates comparisons performed between low - fat  fed wild - type and low - fat  fed ko mice and between high - fat  fed wild - type and high - fat  fed ko mice ( mann - whitney u test or anova with bonferroni post hoc test [ j and m ] ) . 
 interestingly  despite the changes in muscle acylcarnitine levels  the activity of -had was not altered ( data not shown ) and middle - aged cd36 ko mice fed a high - fat diet were not protected from decreased levels of ampk or acc phosphorylation ( fig . 5d and e ) compared with young wild - type mice ( fig . 
 2d and f )  suggesting that alternate mechanisms are responsible for the metabolic phenotype observed in cd36 ko mice . 
 similarly  absolute expression of ampk and acc in skeletal muscle from aged cd36 mice is not different between groups ( data not shown ) . 
 although serum free fatty acid levels were elevated in high - fat  fed cd36 ko mice ( fig . 
 5f )  cd36 ablation resulted in a significant reduction in skeletal muscle triglycerides ( fig . 
 by contrast  ceramide levels remained similar between high - fat fed groups ( fig . 
 5i )  suggesting that accumulation of lipid - derived intermediates other than ceramides  may contribute to impaired insulin sensitivity . 
 indeed  reduced intramuscular lipid accumulation in middle - aged cd36 ko mice was associated with both improved whole - body glucose tolerance ( fig . 
 5k ) compared to high - fat fed middle - aged wild - type mice . moreover  fasted insulin levels were significantly reduced ( fig . 
 5 m ) in high - fat fed middle - aged cd36 ko mice compared to high - fat fed middle - aged wild - type mice  suggesting that insulin sensitivity is restored by preventing lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle . 
 interestingly  despite improved glucose utilization and reduced plasma insulin levels in these mice  the phosphorylation status of akt was similar in skeletal muscle from middle - aged wild - type and cd36 ko mice on high - fat diet ( fig . 
 furthermore  we found no difference in glycogen content in livers from cd36 ko mice fed a low - fat or high - fat diet ( data not shown )  suggesting that the improved glucose tolerance observed in these mice is the result of increased glucose uptake and/or glucose oxidation in skeletal muscle from cd36 ko mice and not alterations in hepatic glucose metabolism . 
 to determine whether an age - related decline in resting metabolic rate and energy expenditure might contribute to the development of insulin resistance  c57bl6 mice of 1214 ( young ) or 5258 ( middle - aged ) weeks of age were analyzed using indirect calorimetry . as mice aged and body weight was increased ( fig . 
 1a )  substrate use was altered slightly  with reductions in rer indicating that middle - aged mice used more fatty acid throughout the day compared with young mice ( fig . 
 in addition  significant reductions in oxygen consumption ( vo2 ) ( fig . 1c ) and carbon dioxide production ( vco2 ) ( fig . 
 1d ) were observed during both the dark ( active ) and light ( inactive ) phases in middle - aged mice compared with young mice . 
 1e ) was decreased in middle - aged mice compared with young mice  whereas activity measurements were not significantly different between age - groups ( fig . 
 our data indicate that middle - aged mice have a lower metabolic rate than young mice and that this might increase susceptibility to weight gain  obesity  and metabolic disease . 
 body weight of young ( 1214 weeks of age ) and middle - aged ( 5258 weeks of age ) mice fed a standard laboratory diet ( a ) . 
 indirect calorimetry was performed to measure respiratory exchange ratio ( rer ) ( b )  vo2 ( c )  vco2 ( d )  and heat production adjusted for bodyweight ( e ) ; total activity ( f ) was measured in both the dark ( active ) and light ( inactive ) phases . 
 p < 0.05 indicates comparisons performed between young and middle - aged mice in either dark or light phases ( mann - whitney u test ) . 
 two - way anova was performed for rer ( b ) and indicated the main effect for age ( p < 0.01 ) . 
 given that skeletal muscle metabolism contributes to whole - body basal metabolic rate  we addressed whether skeletal muscle metabolism was depressed in middle - aged mice by assessing the activities of two enzymes involved in regulating mitochondrial metabolism . 
 2a ) was elevated in the middle - aged compared with the young mice  and citrate synthase ( fig . 
 2b ) followed a similar upward trend  suggesting that -oxidation and tca cycle activity were not directly compromised in the middle - aged mice . since mitochondrial number ( fig . 
 2c ) or function did not appear to be altered at middle age  we next assessed whether peroxisome proliferator  activated receptor ( ppar) responsive genes or molecular signaling cascades known to regulate skeletal muscle fatty acid flux and fatty acid entry into the mitochondria were associated with this overall reduction in whole - body basal metabolic rate observed in middle age . although a more comprehensive assessment of the multiple mediators of fatty acid utilization may reveal additional mechanisms  we did not observe any changes in protein levels of known ppar responsive genes involved in lipid metabolism  including malonyl - coa decarboxylase and acyl - coa synthetase 1 ( data not shown ) . as a result  we also examined the energy - sensing kinase  ampk  which is known for its ability to govern energy metabolism ( 23 ) . in agreement with previous reports using older rodents ( 2425 )  levels of phosphorylated ampk 
 were significantly reduced in skeletal muscle of middle - aged mice compared with young mice ( fig . 
 moreover  the phosphorylation status of acetyl coa carboxylase ( acc )  the downstream target of ampk that indirectly regulates fatty acid entry into the mitochondria and ultimately -oxidation  was significantly decreased in skeletal muscle from middle - aged mice ( fig . 
 although reduced ampk phosphorylation could be the result of impaired activity of upstream ampk kinases or increased ampk phosphatase activity  it is currently unknown which of these contributes to reduced ampk phosphorylation in our model . 
 however  consistent with decreased energy expenditure  increased adiposity  and reduced ampk activity in skeletal muscle from middle - aged mice  the levels of skeletal muscle triglycerides were significantly elevated in middle - aged mice compared with young mice ( fig 
 . 2 g ) . given that lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle has been proposed in rodents ( 26 ) and humans ( 172728 ) to be one of the primary causes of skeletal muscle insulin resistance  we next investigated whether glucose tolerance was impaired in middle - aged mice . despite elevated intramuscular triglycerides ( fig . 2 g ) and impaired basal and insulin - stimulated akt phosphorylation ( fig . 
 2h and i  respectively ) in skeletal muscle of middle - aged mice  whole - body glucose tolerance ( fig . 
 2k ) were not different in middle - aged compared with young mice  suggesting that age - induced alterations in skeletal muscle fatty acid handling and increased triglyceride storage precede the development of insulin resistance and metabolic disease . 
 alterations in fatty acid handling and reduced insulin signaling in skeletal muscle of middle - aged mice do not result in impaired whole - body glucose tolerance . 
 activity of two mitochondrial enzymes -had ( a ) and citrate synthase ( cs ) ( b ) was determined in gastrocnemius muscle from overnight fasted young ( 1214 weeks of age ) and middle - aged ( 5258 weeks of age ) mice . 
 immunoblot analysis using a total oxphos complex antibody cocktail was performed in gastrocnemius muscle lysates  and immunoblots were normalized against tubulin as a control for protein loading ( c ) . 
 phosphorylation status of ampk at threonine 172 ( d ) and acc at serine 79 ( f ) was detected using immunoblot analysis with phospho - specific antibodies . 
 immunoblots were quantified by densitometry and normalized against total protein levels of ampk ( e ) and acc ( f ) . 
 triglyceride ( tg ) levels ( g ) and phosphorylation status of akt ( h ) were determined in gastrocnemius muscle from overnight - fasted young and middle - aged mice . 
 gastrocnemius muscle was collected from a separate group of overnight - fasted young and middle - aged mice following intraperitoneal injection with either saline or human recombinant insulin ( 10 units / kg )  and immunoblots were performed to detect phosphorylation status of akt at serine 473 in gastrocnemius muscle lysates ( i ) . 
 glucose tolerance test ( j ) was performed in young (  ) and middle - aged (  ) mice following a 6-h fast . 
 serum insulin was detected in young and middle - aged mice after an overnight fast ( k ) . 
 p < 0.05 indicates comparisons performed between young and middle - aged mice ( mann - whitney u test ) . 
 since we speculated that middle - aged mice are more susceptible than young mice to the development of insulin resistance  young and middle - aged mice were subjected to high - fat feeding for 12 weeks . 
 3a ) and signs of glucose intolerance compared with young mice fed a low - fat diet ( fig . 
 in contrast  middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet showed significant weight gain ( body weight : low fat  30.18  0.70 g  high fat  55.14  1.56 g ; p < 0.05 ) and displayed dramatically elevated insulin levels ( fig . 
 in addition  whole - body glucose tolerance in the middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet was significantly impaired compared with that in middle - aged mice fed a low - fat diet ( fig . 
 although activation of insulin signaling  as determined by the phosphorylation status of akt is not impaired in skeletal muscle of young ( fig . 
 3j ) mice fed a high - fat diet compared with that in mice fed a low - fat diet  this is likely due to elevated levels of circulating insulin ( fig . 
 3e and f ) observed in the respective high - fat groups . in support of the glucose tolerance data  
 homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance values were significantly higher in the high - fat  fed middle - aged mice ( fig . 
 3k )  suggesting that high - fat feeding induces more dramatic insulin resistance in middle - aged mice than in young mice . 
 interestingly  young mice on a high - fat diet were of the same weight as middle - aged mice on a low - fat diet ; yet  only the young mice on a high - fat diet had impaired glucose disposal ( data not shown ) . 
 although we can not discriminate between the effects of aging and increased adiposity because these variables coassociate  our findings do suggest that the increased weight gain associated with aging is not sufficient to alter whole - body glucose disposal and that other factors such as high - fat diet are likely involved . aging increases the susceptibility to the development of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in mice fed a high - fat diet . 
 body weights ( a )  fed and fasted blood glucose ( b )  glucose tolerance test ( c )  and phosphorylation status of akt ( d ) were measured in gastrocnemius muscle from young ( 1214 weeks of age ) mice following 12 weeks of high fat ( hf ) feeding .

 significant effect of age  diet  and age  diet interaction ( p < 0.05 ) was observed for e  f  and k. * 
 p < 0.05 indicates comparisons performed between young and middle - aged mice or between low- and high - fat fed mice in fed or fasted state ( mann - whitney u test ) . because high - fat diet  induced insulin resistance in young rodents is associated with an increased efficiency of fatty acid uptake into skeletal muscle ( 26 )  protein expression of cd36  a protein that facilitates fatty acid transport  was determined in skeletal muscle of mice fed a high - fat diet . 
 consistent with previous publications in young mice ( 262930 )  we observed a modest increase in cd36 protein expression in the muscle of young mice fed a high - fat diet  as well as an increase in intramuscular triglyceride levels ( data not shown ) . 
 consistent with our hypothesis  cd36 expression was significantly elevated in skeletal muscle of middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet compared with that in mice fed a low - fat diet ( fig . 
 3l ) . in accordance with increased cd36 protein expression  skeletal muscle triglyceride levels were significantly elevated in high - fat  fed middle - aged mice compared with those in low - fat  fed mice ( fig . 
 3 m )  as were long - chain acyl - coa esters ( fig . 
 together  these data suggest that increased cd36-mediated fatty acid transport may contribute to lipid accumulation and impaired insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle of middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet . 
 to investigate whether inhibition of fatty acid transport into the skeletal muscle could alter the observed responses of a middle - aged mouse to a high - fat diet  we utilized the cd36 ko mouse  which has skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake rates 4070% of those in wild - type mice ( 3132 ) . 
 interestingly  there was a striking difference in weight gain between middle - aged wild - type and cd36 ko mice following 12 weeks of high - fat feeding ( fig . 
 4a )  with middle - aged cd36 ko mice accumulating 51% less weight than the wild - type mice over the same period of time ( fig . 
 4d ) between groups could not account for this dramatic change in weight gain  indirect calorimetry indicated that energy expenditure ( fig . 
 4 g ) were significantly increased in middle - aged cd36 ko mice fed a high - fat diet compared with those in high - fat  fed middle - aged wild - type mice . 
 although this increased activity in the middle - aged cd36 ko mouse fed a high - fat diet could be attributed to the absence of obesity  heat production was also increased in middle - aged cd36 ko mice fed a low - fat diet compared with that in low - fat  fed middle - aged wild - type mice ( fig .

 to gain a more comprehensive metabolic assessment of muscle metabolism in middle - aged wild - type and cd36 ko mice fed a low - fat or high - fat diet  we used mass spectrometry to measure a broad range of intermediary metabolites  including acylcarnitines of various chain lengths  organic acids  and amino acids . 
 acylcarnitines are by - products of fuel catabolism that respond to changes in substrate availability or flux limitations at specific mitochondrial enzymes ( 143334 ) . 
 middle - aged cd36 ko mice fed a low - fat diet had elevated levels of acetyl - carnitine ( c2 )  and -hydroxybutyryl - carnitine ( c4oh ) compared with their wild - type counterparts ( supplemental fig . 1a and supplemental table 1 ) . whereas several short - chain acylcarnitine species  including c2 and c4oh  as well as propionyl - carnitine ( c3 ) and succinyl - carnitine ( c4dc )  tended to increase in response to a high - fat diet  these same metabolites trended downward in cd36 ko mice fed a high - fat diet ( supplemental fig . 1a and supplemental table 1 ) . 
 in addition  several long - chain acylcarnitine species were reduced in muscle from wild - type mice fed a high - fat diet while at the same time levels of hydroxylated long - chain acylcarnitine ( lcoh ) species were increased  resulting in a robust increase in the long - chain  to  lcoh acylcarnitine ratio ( fig . 5a 
 c ) . given that long - chain acylcarnitines accumulate when their production by mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyl transferase ( cpt)1 exceeds flux through -oxidation enzymes  such as long - chain acyl - coa dehydrogenase ( lcad ) and -had ( 35 )  this pattern is consistent with a diet - induced shift in flux limitation from lcad to -had . 
 notably  levels of many long - chain and lcoh acylcarnitines were lower in the cd36 ko mice fed a high - fat diet than in the wild - type mice fed a high - fat diet ( fig . 
 the organic acids were less responsive to both diet and genotype  although subtle changes were detected in succinate  fumarate  and citrate levels ( supplemental fig . 
 muscle levels of amino acids were higher in wild - type mice fed a low - fat diet but were dramatically decreased following high - fat feeding . by comparison  
 amino acid levels remained unchanged in cd36 ko mice in response to a high - fat diet ( supplemental fig . 
 although these metabolite measurements do not fully characterize mitochondrial substrate flux  together the data suggest that ablation of cd36 not only alters baseline mitochondrial and intermediary metabolism but also significantly impacts the muscle response to lipid exposure . 
 altered skeletal muscle lipid handling prevents development of insulin resistance in middle - aged cd36 ko mice fed a high - fat ( hf ) diet for 12 weeks . 
 acylcarnitine levels were measured in gastrocnemius muscle from overnight - fasted middle - aged ( 4852 weeks of age ) wild - type ( wt ) and cd36 ko mice fed a low- ( lf ) or high - fat diet for 12 weeks .

 immunoblots were quantified by densitometry and normalized against total ampk ( d ) and acc ( e ) . 
 serum levels of free fatty acids ( ffas ) from high - fat  fed wild - type and cd36 ko mice were determined after 12 weeks of diet ( f ) . 
 intramuscular levels of triglyceride ( tg ) ( g )  lccoa ( h )  and c18 ceramide ( i ) were determined in gastrocnemius muscle obtained from wild - type and ko mice fed a high - fat diet for 12 weeks . 
 glucose tolerance testing ( j ) was performed in high - fat  fed wild - type and ko mice fasted for 6 h. fasted blood glucose ( k ) and serum insulin ( l ) levels obtained from middle - aged wild - type and ko mice fed a high - fat diet for 12 weeks .

 main effects of genotype  diet  and genotype  diet interactions on acylcarnitine levels ( a  c ) were detected by two - way anova . 
 for simplicity  symbols indicate metabolites that were affected by genotype  diet  or a genotype - diet interaction . 
 detailed results of the statistical analysis for all acylcarnitine species are presented in supplemental table 1 . 
 * p < 0.05 indicates comparisons performed between low - fat  fed wild - type and low - fat  fed ko mice and between high - fat  fed wild - type and high - fat  fed ko mice ( mann - whitney u test or anova with bonferroni post hoc test [ j and m ] ) . 
 interestingly  despite the changes in muscle acylcarnitine levels  the activity of -had was not altered ( data not shown ) and middle - aged cd36 ko mice fed a high - fat diet were not protected from decreased levels of ampk or acc phosphorylation ( fig . 5d and e ) compared with young wild - type mice ( fig . 
 2d and f )  suggesting that alternate mechanisms are responsible for the metabolic phenotype observed in cd36 ko mice . similarly  
 absolute expression of ampk and acc in skeletal muscle from aged cd36 mice is not different between groups ( data not shown ) . 
 although serum free fatty acid levels were elevated in high - fat  fed cd36 ko mice ( fig . 
 5f )  cd36 ablation resulted in a significant reduction in skeletal muscle triglycerides ( fig . 
 by contrast  ceramide levels remained similar between high - fat fed groups ( fig . 
 5i )  suggesting that accumulation of lipid - derived intermediates other than ceramides  may contribute to impaired insulin sensitivity . 
 indeed  reduced intramuscular lipid accumulation in middle - aged cd36 ko mice was associated with both improved whole - body glucose tolerance ( fig . 
 5k ) compared to high - fat fed middle - aged wild - type mice . 
 5 m ) in high - fat fed middle - aged cd36 ko mice compared to high - fat fed middle - aged wild - type mice  suggesting that insulin sensitivity is restored by preventing lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle . 
 interestingly  despite improved glucose utilization and reduced plasma insulin levels in these mice  the phosphorylation status of akt was similar in skeletal muscle from middle - aged wild - type and cd36 ko mice on high - fat diet ( fig . 
 furthermore  we found no difference in glycogen content in livers from cd36 ko mice fed a low - fat or high - fat diet ( data not shown )  suggesting that the improved glucose tolerance observed in these mice is the result of increased glucose uptake and/or glucose oxidation in skeletal muscle from cd36 ko mice and not alterations in hepatic glucose metabolism . 
 consistent with previous reports ( 17 )  our data show a significant decline in metabolic rate in middle - aged mice when compared to their young counterparts ( fig . 
 interestingly  although mitochondrial function was not directly assessed in this study  the decline in overall metabolic rate did not appear to stem from compromised mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle of middle - aged mice compared to young mice . 
 indeed  whole body rer was modestly decreased with aging and muscle activity of -had increased  suggesting there is a shift in substrate selection from carbohydrates toward fatty acids . 
 however  the age - associated reduction in overall metabolic rate did not appear to correlate with changes in maximal activities of mitochondrial enzymes in muscle from young and middle - aged mice ( fig . 
 2a and 2b )  suggesting other factors may influence substrate oxidation in muscle  as well as overall metabolic rate . 
 consistent with this  the ampk / acc signaling axis was significantly reduced in skeletal muscle from middle - aged mice ( fig . 2d and 2f ) . still unclear 
 is whether reduced ampk phosphorylation in the older mice reflects a cause or consequence of reduced metabolic rate . 
 although results of a recent study suggest that acc - mediated shifts in fat oxidation per se do not impact whole body energy expenditure or susceptibility to diet - induced obesity ( 36 )  ampk acts on a broad range of enzymatic and transcriptional targets that could affect energy balance via mechanisms other than substrate selection ( 2537 ) . nonetheless  cd36 deficiency raised metabolic rate without activating ampk  indicating that other mechanisms are operative in this model ( see below ) . although akt phosphorylation is reduced in skeletal muscle from middle - aged mice compared to young mice ( fig . 
 2h and 2i ) whole - body glucose tolerance and plasma insulin levels remained normal ( fig . 
 2j and 2k )  suggesting that impaired activation of insulin - signaling parameters in skeletal muscle precede overt changes in whole body glucose disposal and may increase the susceptibility of aged mice to diet - induced insulin resistance . to determine whether middle - aged mice indeed are more susceptible to developing insulin resistance in response to a high - fat diet compared to their younger counterparts  we subjected middle - aged mice to 12 weeks of a low - fat or high - fat diet . 
 as expected  middle - aged mice gained significantly more weight than young mice when fed a high - fat diet ( weight gain : middle - aged  22.8  1.9 g versus young  12.0  1.1 g ; p < 0.01 ) . 
 3c  3h and 3i )  high - fat diet - induced hyperinsulinemia was only observed in middle - aged mice ( fig . 3e and 3f )  indicating that increased -cell insulin secretion was sufficient to offset overt hyperglycemia in this age - group ( fig . 
 3 g ) . given that prolonged hypersecretion of insulin by the -cells to compensate for peripheral insulin resistance can contribute to -cell failure ( 38 ) and potentially type 2 diabetes ( 39 )  our data suggest that middle - aged mice have a heightened susceptibility to the development of insulin resistance . 
 however  this susceptibility might not be due to aging per se  since adiposity was also increased in the older mice . as our study design does not permit to discriminate between the effects of aging and adiposity on skeletal muscle metabolism and the development of insulin resistance  future experiments should be directed at conducting weight loss ( food restriction ) studies or exercise studies to determine if these 
 nevertheless  as aging and increased adiposity co - associate our findings likely reflect the majority of middle - aged humans in the western world who are at risk of developing insulin resistance . 
 although intramuscular lipid accumulation associated with aging did not appear to result from mitochondrial dysfunction  we do show a significant twofold increase in cd36 protein expression in skeletal muscle of high - fat fed middle - aged mice compared to low - fat fed middle - aged mice ( fig . 
 3l )  suggesting fatty acid transport into muscle exceeded the capacity for their oxidation . 
 although it is unknown what caused increased cd36 expression in our study  it may have resulted from high levels of plasma glucose levels that have been shown to regulate cd36 expression through both transcriptional and/or translational mechanisms in rodents and humans ( 4041 ) . to determine whether reduced fatty acid transport and metabolism could rescue the high - fat diet - induced phenotype 
 consistent with our prediction  cd36 deficiency prevented the decline in metabolic rate and energy expenditure in middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet as compared to age - matched wild - type mice ( fig . 4e and 4f ) . since food intake was similar between groups ( fig . 
 4c )  we propose that increased energy expenditure in high - fat fed middle - aged cd36 ko mice contributes to their protection against diet - induced obesity ( fig . 
 4b ) . the blunted decline in metabolic rate in the middle - aged cd36 ko mice fed a high - fat diet ( fig . 
 4e and 4f ) was accompanied by alterations in muscle concentrations of several metabolic intermediates ( fig . 
 1 )  but no improvement in ampk and acc phosphorylation ( fig . 5d and 5e  respectively ) . 
 the impact of the diet on muscle metabolites in this study differed to some extent as compared to a previous report ( 14 ) in which tissue specimens were harvested from younger animals in the fed state . 
 herein  tissues were collected after an overnight fast because we sought to evaluate a state of heightened fatty acid oxidation . under these conditions  
 the drop in long - chain acylcarnitines could reflect decreased fatty acid availability  lower cpt1 activity or increased long - chain acyl coa flux through lcad . 
 first  the high - fat diet increases rather than decreases lipid delivery to muscle . 
 second  of the two major products of cpt1 ( palmitoylcarnitine ( c16 ) and oleylcarnitine ( c18:1 )  only the unsaturated species was reduced by the diet ( fig . 
 5a )  suggesting upregulation of the isomerase enzyme that catalyzes conversion of the double bond ( 42 ) . 
 5c ) in response to chronic lipid exposure suggest a shift in flux limitation from the earlier to later steps in -oxidation . 
 lastly  the diet resulted in a robust drop in whole body rer  indicative of a systemic increase in fat oxidation . 
 notably  cd36 deficiency altered baseline levels of several muscle metabolites  and in general  tended to mitigate diet - induced changes in several acylcarnitine and amino acid species . this apparent resistance to diet - induced metabolic perturbations in the cd36 ko mice 
 might be directly related to a reduction in fat delivery and/or secondary to enhanced energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity . 
 although further work is necessary to fully understand the implications of these results  it is clear that loss of cd36 has a global impact on muscle fuel metabolism . 
 in addition  it is possible that other organs such as adipose tissue  liver and brain ( 4344 ) are also involved in maintaining a high level of energy expenditure in the middle - aged cd36 ko mice . 
 overall  ablation of cd36 was associated with an improvement in whole - body glucose utilization and insulin sensitivity ( fig . 
 although the mechanisms responsible for this are not known  excessive intramuscular lipid accumulation induced by high - fat feeding was prevented in skeletal muscle of middle - aged cd36 ko mice ( fig . 5 g and 5h ) . whereas elevated intramuscular triglyceride levels were not associated with insulin resistance in young mice ( fig . 
 2j2k )  preventing the more dramatic age- and diet - induced accumulation of intramuscular triglyceride and long - chain acyl coa levels in middle - aged cd36 ko mice correlated with improved whole - body insulin sensitivity . 
 although there is ample evidence indicating that cd36 ablation significantly reduces skeletal muscle fatty acid uptake ( 3132 )  it is also possible that the effects that we report using the cd36 ko mice are secondary to changes in fatty acid metabolism . 
 notwithstanding this later possibility  our data demonstrate that limiting cd36-mediated skeletal muscle fatty acid transport guards against whole - body and muscle insulin resistance in middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet . 
 this finding suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for combating metabolic disease in the face of age - related abnormalities .

Abstract: This study investigated the impact of middle age on skeletal muscle fatty acid handling and its role in the development of insulin resistance. The research included a comparison of young and middle-aged mice fed with standard or high-fat diets, and analysis of molecular signaling pathways and mitochondrial substrate flux.

Research and Discussion: The findings suggest that middle age alone is not a major risk factor for insulin resistance, as middle-aged mice on standard diets did not show significant insulin resistance despite an increase in intramuscular triglycerides. However, when exposed to high-fat diets, middle-aged mice were more prone to developing insulin resistance, which was prevented in middle-aged cd36 knockout mice by limiting fatty acid transport.

Results and Conclusion: This study provides insight into how aging contributes to the development of insulin resistance and suggests that limiting skeletal muscle fatty acid transport is an effective way to delay insulin resistance and prevent metabolic disease when exposed to a high-fat diet. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms of aging in relation to metabolic health and suggest a potential target for intervention in preventing age-related insulin resistance."
"sarcopenia is present in approximately 513% of persons over the age of 60 years and defined as the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with progressive decline in mobility and function . 
 the pathogenesis of sarcopenia is associated with many intrinsic and extrinsic factors  including proinflammatory cytokine accumulation  oxidative stress  mitochondrial dysfunction  insulin resistance  and aging - related loss of anabolic hormones and motor neuron end plates . 
 the loss of skeletal muscle results from an imbalance of protein metabolism  which is the dynamic balance between protein degradation and protein synthesis . 
 the protein degradation systems in skeletal muscle are modulated by a coordinated network of signaling pathways activated   or suppressed by hormones and cytokines ; therefore  catabolism is stimulated by a variety of proinflammatory cytokines  glucocorticoids  and reactive oxygen species ( ros ) [ 5  6 ] . 
 it is important to note that impaired cellular immune function combined with low - grade inflammation represents a continuous impact in aging process . 
 although aging is associated with prolonged inflammatory activity that is mainly attributed to progressively worsening muscle weakness  it is unclear whether these processes are cross - talked . 
 molecular signals and pathways connecting inflammatory system and muscle degeneration may be the key to reveal the interactions responsible for the progression of sarcopenia . the interplay seems to exist between the mass loss of skeletal muscle and elevated systemic inflammation ( figure 1 ) . 
 sarcopenia is a complex process with a subclinical state of inflammation driven by proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress  which increases the infiltration of immune cells into injured muscles . in turn 
  inflammation aggravates muscle loss and fat accumulation in the aging skeletal muscle and further decreases muscle function and physical activity . 
 the increase in chronic inflammation response associated with high - level proinflammatory mediators as the extension of age has been considered as one of the diagnostic hallmarks and a significant contributor to aging - related atrophy of skeletal muscle . 
 the transcription factor  nuclear factor-b ( nf-b )  has been considered as an important mediator underlying the relationship between inflammation and aging [ 10  11 ] . 
 the correlation between inflammation and sarcopenia exists as a possible linkage describing the effect of inflammation on the balance between protein anabolism and catabolism  with the presence of cd68 + macrophage infiltration . 
 it is worth noting that substantial evidence also demonstrates the connection between obesity and sarcopenia  namely   sarcopenic obesity  . 
 in fact  obesity always plays an important role in sarcopenia  by the way of adding inflammatory burden . during obesity  
 adipose tissue is characterized by a chronic inflammatory state  through the release of numerous proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf- )  interleukin-6 ( il-6 )  and interleukin-1 beta ( il-1 ) as the factors largely responsible for insulin resistance in obese adipose tissue combined with aging - related skeletal muscle loss . 
 moreover  impaired mitochondria can be both the reason and the consequence of inflammation during aging . 
 increasing evidence shows that mitochondria may contribute to inflammation via ros production  nf-b activation  calcium homeostasis  impaired autophagy  and atp deficiency [ 17  18 ] . 
 dysfunctional mitochondria are able to modulate aging - related inflammatory processes through direct activation of nlrp3 inflammasome  which can correspondingly result in the activation of caspase-1 or redox - sensitive inflammatory signaling pathways  thus leading to the production of il-1 and il-18 [ 19  20 ] . 
 it should be noted that increasing ros could stimulate the activation of nf-b via nf-b - inducing kinase ( nik ) and ib kinase  and  ( ikk/ ) [ 21  22 ] . since the increased redox activation in the presence of transcription factor nf-b  excessive ros generation plays an important role in impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative capacity and accelerates the aging process of skeletal muscle . as described above 
  sarcopenia is a common feature in the elderly and mainly related to the release of inflammatory mediators from damaged tissue . 
 these responses are controlled by a combination of various cytokines responsible for inflammatory pathways [ 10  24 ] . 
 given that the inflammatory response is a complex system  cytokines are important not only as the indicators for mediating chronic inflammatory state through increasing protein degradation and reducing protein synthesis  but also as the mediators for controlling muscle wasting by directly targeting muscle tissue . 
 in particular  proinflammatory cytokines are well known to impinge on protein metabolism in skeletal muscle and result in the activation of catabolism signals or upregulate inflammatory pathways such as nf-b and stat3  thus finally leading to the increased activation of ubiquitin - proteasome and autophagy system [ 26  27 ] . 
 the chronic inflammatory aging process depends not only on increased expression of proinflammatory factors  but also on reduced levels of anti - inflammatory factors such as il-10  one of the anti - inflammatory cytokines . 
 since the presence and function of cytokines have been demonstrated in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia  their origins and types must be identified . 
 in fact  cytokines can be secreted by various types of cells like inflammatory and stromal cells  as well as skeletal muscle cells . in skeletal muscle  
 the constitutive expression of cytokines is generally stronger in differentiated myotubes compared with myoblasts  which usually results in inconspicuous change in cytokine release to stimuli [ 29  30 ] . accumulating evidences over the past decade 
 have demonstrated that those proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-  il-6  and c - reactive protein ( crp ) cause a significant increase in aging skeletal muscle cells and play a key role in the complex network of inflammatory signals in charge of muscle homeostasis connected with aging - related disability and mortality [ 31  32 ] . 
 has originally been classified as a prototypical proinflammatory cytokine to exhibit marked pleiotropy  and its anti - inflammatory property has also been identified later [ 34  35 ] . 
 il-6 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases including sarcopenia by regulating inflammatory and metabolic functions . 
 il-6 signaling involves the binding to the membrane - bound il-6 receptor in skeletal muscle and the activation of downstream signaling pathways including stat3  mapk / erk  p38  myostatin  and foxo3 pathways [ 3740 ] . 
 additionally  il-6 has confirmed to have the function of activating ampk and/or phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( pi3k ) and regulating the metabolism in skeletal muscle [ 41  42 ] . 
 the overexpression of il-6 can result in reduced body mass and impaired insulin - stimulated glucose uptake in mouse skeletal muscle . 
 furthermore  the infusion of il-6 in skeletal muscle can reduce the phosphorylation of s6k1  which is activated by akt / mtor and associated with the inhibition of anabolic process . 
 a comparative analysis of cytokine levels has confirmed the upregulation of proinflammatory il-6 and crp in the elderly  along with increased risk for the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength . according to a recent study  the serum high - sensitivity crp ( hs - crp ) levels in the obesity only and in the sarcopenic obesity groups are significantly higher than that in the normal group after multivariate adjustments  which provides the evidence that obesity and sarcopenic obesity are associated with increased levels of serum hs - crp among males . 
 tnf- is a cytokine implicated in the metabolic disturbance of chronic inflammation  with the formation of il-1  which has been identified as a circulatory factor to increase gluconeogenesis  lipolysis  and proteolysis  accompanied with the decrease in protein  lipid  and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle . during the stages of muscle regeneration  tnf- and il-1 are observed in injured muscle with an accumulation of macrophages [ 48  49 ] . 
 also  tnf- and il-1 have been confirmed to promote il-6 secretion through activating nf-b in cultured skeletal muscle cells . 
 several previous studies have confirmed that tnf- at the elevated level can increase catabolism in skeletal muscle by suppressing akt / mtor pathway . 
 tnf- and its soluble receptors have been described as the important contributors or biomarkers for the loss of mass and strength in aged skeletal muscle . 
 there is a strongly negative correlation between protein breakdown and tnf- concentration in the elderly . 
 injecting tnf- into mice has revealed the activation of ubiquitin - proteasome system and the decrease of skeletal muscle function . in vivo 
  the synthesis rate of myosin heavy chain protein is correlated negatively with the expression of tnf- in skeletal muscle . 
 tnf- induces skeletal muscle loss through increased myofibrillar protein degradation and cell apoptosis  thus resulting in muscle atrophy and the inhibition of muscle regeneration following injury [ 55  56 ] . 
 additionally  it seems that tnf- may antagonize the anabolic effect of insulin growth factor-1 ( igf-1 )  due to the development of growth hormone resistance  which decreases both circulating and muscular igf-1 [ 57  58 ] . 
 recent studies have shown that g / a-308 tnf- polymorphism as a marker of sarcopenia in normal weight obese syndrome  suggesting the importance of tnf- in the diagnosis of sarcopenia . 
 it is important to note that an increase in tnf- alone is not sufficient to cause muscle atrophy . 
 the upregulation of nf-b can cause muscle atrophy in rodents and contribute to the progressive muscle loss of advancing age . 
 other mediators such as interferon- ( ifn- ) are produced in the microenvironment of skeletal muscle and play a critical role during myogenesis . 
 moreover  il-15   is usually mentioned among paracrine effectors  while cytokines such as irisin   and myonectin   are able to induce anti - inflammatory cytokines ( il-1 receptor antagonist and il-10 )  especially during contraction and aging conditions . 
 the levels of tlr4 protein and il6  il10  and il15 mrna expression are increased after short - time bed rest in healthy older adults  while the levels of ifn- and macrophage inflammatory protein-1-beta ( mip-1 ) are elevated in aging skeletal muscle . 
 furthermore  peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma coactivator-1-alpha ( pgc-1 ) is regarded to have an anti - inflammatory function by inhibiting the function of foxo3  which could promote inflammatory cytokine expression and downregulate antioxidant enzyme expression in aging muscle . 
 the reduced expression of pgc-1 results in a low level and a systemic inflammatory response to exhibit negative impacts on skeletal muscle . 
 inversely  the upregulated pgc-1 can reduce the activity of nf-b  which contributes to the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines to be benefit for the prevention of mass and strength loss of skeletal muscle and functional decline of other organs  as well as the ultimate impact on homeostasis in human body [ 68  69 ] . 
 proinflammatory cytokines have a wide variety of roles in inflammation systems and may be the important factor predisposing to muscle catabolism response in the elderly . 
 however  the roles of these cytokines in aging skeletal muscle are still not fully understood . 
 furthermore  the tissue - specific inflammatory signaling pathways in response to cytokines along with the elevation of systemic cytokines are important elements to be considered . 
 mirnas are short noncoding rnas with approximately 22 nucleotides in length and are involved in the complex posttranscriptional regulatory networks and the maintenance of healthy cellular functions such as growth  development  and metabolism . 
 skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in human body  comprising 4050% of body mass . 
 it is estimated that approximately 60% of human genes are regulated by mirnas  suggesting that highly enriched mirnas in skeletal muscle play important roles in biological processes by gene silencing  including aging process . 
 the functions of mirnas can be achieved either by suppressing the translation of target messenger rnas ( mrnas ) or by promoting the degradation of mrnas  thereby providing a powerful and sensitive regulator to tune gene expression and cell functions during the aging process of skeletal muscle . 
 mirnas  from noncoding rna genes or within protein - coding genes  are transcribed into primicrornas by rna polymerase ii or polymerase iii in some cases and subsequently embedded into premicrorna hairpins like rna duplex by drosha [ 73  74 ] . 
 premicrorna hairpins are exported from nucleus by exportin-5 and processed into double - stranded mature mirnas by dicer in combination with its rna - binding cofactor . 
 after dicer - mediated maturation  the mirnas orient the risc complex with the removal or the preservation of one strand as the guide strand and preferentially load on the risc complex in position at regulatory sequences in target genes . 
 although the precise mechanisms for mirna targeting and activity still remain to be fully explored  mirna activity appears to be largely dependent on its binding capacity to the target mrna molecule [ 7779 ] . 
 generally  mrnas contain a predicted binding site in the 3 untranslated region ( utr )  less commonly  in the 5 utr  and many mrnas contain multiple potential binding sites . 
 according to the binding complementarity of the seed sequence  argonaute proteins such as ago-2 can directly cleave messenger rna and normally repress gene expression by targeting the mrna for degradation (  complete match  
 risc binds to mrna with perfect match ) or by mediating translation inhibition or mrna deadenylation leading to mrna destabilization at the condition with mismatches between mrna sequence and the risc (  incomplete match   risc binds to mrna with some mismatches ) . however  there are still unsettled questions regarding mirna - binding rules  thereby resulting in a lack of consensus in previous studies . 
 establishing direct cause - and - effect links between mirnas and mrna targets is a key to understand underlying molecular mechanisms behind health and diseases and to develop effective targeted therapeutic strategies . now that mirnas have multiple gene targets  each target may be regulated by a suite of mirnas . 
 the roles of mirnas in inflammation and sarcopenia have only been initially explored and future investigations will unravel their roles in immunity and metabolism . according to the analysis of mirna expression profiling  mirnas are critical regulators for both proinflammatory cytokines and skeletal muscle function [ 82  83 ] . in order to elucidate which mirna is important in the production of proinflammatory cytokines in aging - related muscle wasting  mrna targets and specific roles in regeneration and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle need to be established . 
 several tissue - specific mirnas are known to be associated with the aging of skeletal muscle  which are named as myomirnas and consistently identified  including mir-1  mir-133  mir-206  mir-208  mir-486  mir-431  and mir-499 [ 8486 ] . 
 these myomirnas can induce significant effects on development and myogenesis of skeletal muscle by targeting myogenic factors such as srf  mef2  and myostatin . 
 local injection of mir-206 can accelerate muscle regeneration  and mir-133 can promote the proliferation of myoblasts  while mir-1 can suppress the proliferation of myoblasts . although there is no obvious difference in the expression of mature mir-1  mir-133  or mir-206 in skeletal muscle from younger adults  an increased expression of these primary mirnas 
 can be observed during aging  and the effect of anabolic stimulus on the levels of these mirnas can be perturbed in the elderly . on the other hand 
  many studies have implicated the regulation of inflammatory response through inflammatory mirnas such as mir-155 and mir-146a  suggesting their roles in the immune system . since inflammation is rather a broad concept  there are some overlaps between mirnas involved in inflammation and aging . 
 therefore  cytokine - associated mirnas appear to have central roles in both inflammation and sarcopenia . 
 a recent rna sequencing study has demonstrated the differential expression of mirnas in skeletal muscle from old and young rhesus monkeys . 
 mir-181a  with its role in tuning the threshold of t - cell receptor ( tcr ) signaling originally described  not only acts as a myomirna  but also impacts inflammatory system . 
 it can downregulate sirtuin 1 ( sirt1 ) gene expression as a regulator so that the expression of mir-181a and its target gene is disrupted in aged skeletal muscle . 
 moreover  based on earlier reports showing proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf-  il-6  il-1  and il-8 as the proposed targets of mir-181a  the reduction of mir-181a can be responsible for an increase in the abovementioned proinflammatory cytokines in skeletal muscle during aging process . 
 besides  tnf- and il-1 are significantly negatively correlated with decreased expression of myomirs and can suppress the differentiation of c2c12 myoblasts to myocytes / myotubes through nf-b  jak / stat  mapk p38  or other key pathways . 
 a newly discovered proinflammatory cytokine  tnf - like weak inducer of apoptosis ( tweak )  belongs to tnf family and has revealed the function for causing muscle atrophy . 
 one of the mechanisms proposed for the induction of skeletal muscle wasting by tweak is regulating differential expression of several growth - related mirnas  including mir-1  mir-23  mir-133a  mir-133b  and mir-206 in c2c12 myotubes ; however  it can reduce mir-1  mir-133a  and mir-133b only in mouse skeletal muscle . 
 while the treatment with tweak regulates several mirnas involved in the growth of skeletal muscle  it is not known whether their regulation is a cause of muscle wasting or a compensatory response to prevent further muscle wasting . 
 let-7 mirna  the first known human mirna  has been reported to be critical for promoting differentiation and inhibiting cellular proliferation . 
 the elevation of let-7 mirna may be responsible for the damage - repairing capability through the activation and proliferation of satellite cells in skeletal muscle from the elderly  therefore contributing to the attenuated regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle in the elderly . 
 moreover  let-7 mirna can inhibit the secretion of inflammatory cytokine il-13 in human myotubes . 
 recent study has also found that the overexpression of mirna let-7c can inhibit lps - induced production of tnf-  il-6  and il-1 by inhibiting the phosphorylation of stat3 . 
 compared to younger individuals  skeletal muscle from older individuals shows a significant elevation in let-7b and let-7e under resting conditions  suggesting the involvement of these mirnas in regulating cell cycle based on let-7 target genes . 
 mir-146a  which negatively regulates the expression of il-1 and il-6  is highly expressed in aged mice as a consequence of an aberrant nf-b binding to mir-146a promoter . as a result 
  the negative feedback regulation loop inducing the downregulation of inflammatory factors can be interrupted in aged mice . in macrophages isolated from aged mice  
 both dna methyl - transferase inhibitor and histone deacetylase inhibitor are able to significantly upregulate mir-146a through transcriptional activation by altering dna binding activity of nf-b 
 . reduced mir-146a in oxldl - activated macrophages is linked to an increase of its target  toll - like receptor 4 ( tlr4 )  involved in lipid uptake and inflammatory cytokine secretion . due to the upregulation in inflammatory condition in various primary disorders of skeletal muscle  
 mir-155 is identified as an important regulator of mef2a expression and exhibits its function in myoblast differentiation  and it also plays a critical role in the regulation of inflammation that affects both innate and adaptive immunity . 
 the upregulation of mir-155 is the most characteristic feature of the mirna expression signature in lps - stimulated macrophages through the binding to nf-b . 
 moreover  the inflammatory response mediated by mir-155 is induced by tlr ligands and can enhance the translation of tnf- during the pathogenesis of metabolic syndromes . 
 in addition  mir-23a negatively regulates pgc-1 as a key activator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function . in another study 
  the level of mir-696 is upregulated in skeletal muscle of mice subjected to hind limb immobilization while the level of pgc-1 as the target of mir-696 exhibits an obvious decrease . 
 consistent with this observation  the overexpression of mir-696 in myocytes shows a decrease in pgc-1  suggesting its involvement in mitochondrial function and metabolism  and its importance in controlling the metabolism  adaptation  and atrophy of skeletal muscle . since a large number of mirnas 
 have been identified in skeletal muscle  the investigation of mirnas is a promising but relatively unexplored area for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of wasting process associated with cytokine expression and secretion in aging skeletal muscle . clearly targeting these mirnas could provide an efficient and noninvasive approach for the diagnosis  prevention  or treatment of sarcopenia through the regulation of proinflammatory and anti - inflammatory factors . 
 potential interventions for sarcopenia include nutritional supplements  physical activity / resistance exercise  caloric restriction  anabolic hormones  anti - inflammatory agents  and antioxidants . 
 a key question is whether sarcopenia is a truly distinct syndrome or a milder form of a cachexia continuum . 
 it is difficult to estimate the prevalence of sarcopenia  mostly because of practical difficulties in assessing skeletal muscle mass . 
 sarcopenia - associated difference in the production of proinflammatory cytokines in vivo shows a prolonged inflammation activity . there remains a lack of understanding of individual contributions of various cytokines during the aging process of skeletal muscle  because of their wide - ranging effects on cell proliferation  differentiation  migration  survival  and apoptosis . as reviewed here 
  mirnas play major roles in the inflammatory regulation as the pivotal regulators for modulating cell functions or the critical factors for affecting the therapeutic outcome of sarcopenia . 
 although the central role of inflammation in sarcopenia and proinflammatory cytokines including tnf- and il-6 as the central mediators of skeletal muscle atrophy has been documented  the roles of inflammatory mirnas in mass maintenance and functional development of skeletal muscle still need to be further explored and confirmed . whether mirnas can be used for the diagnosis of inflammatory involvement in the aging process of skeletal muscle 
 proinflammatory cytokine - associated mirnas such as mir-146a  mir-181  and mir-21 are frequently detected at a high level in skeletal muscle ; however  their functions are still not fully clear . 
 therefore  further exploration of their targets  regulatory networks  and functions is highly desired . in conclusion 
  the discovery of mirnas with regulatory capacity of inflammatory response during aging process of skeletal muscle will open a novel avenue for the diagnosis  prevention  and therapy of sarcopenia through effectively modulating inflammatory signal pathways .","

1) Abstract:
Sarcopenia, a disease characterized by decreased muscle mass, strength and function, is a major contributor to frailty and falls in older adults. Inflammatory signaling pathways have been identified as critical players in the development of sarcopenia, with proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha being key regulators.

2) Research and Discussion:
Research suggests that microRNAs play an important role in maintaining skeletal muscle mass and function by regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines. By understanding the mechanisms through which microRNAs control the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines during sarcopenia, new therapeutic targets and strategies can be developed to combat age-related muscle loss and associated inflammatory diseases.

3) Results and Conclusion:
In this paper, we have provided a comprehensive overview of the regulatory mechanisms of microRNAs in sarcopenia-related inflammation. These findings offer potential targets for intervention and treatment of sarcopenia, highlighting the critical role of inflammatory signaling pathways and the potential of microRNAs as therapeutic targets in combating this age-related disease. Further research in this area may lead to the development of effective treatments to mitigate the impact of sarcopenia on the health and well-being of older adults."
"temporary henna tattoos or pseudotattoo have become increasingly widespread among children and adolescent  as a safe and economic alternative to permanent tattoos . 
 it is well - known that allergic skin reactions to natural henna are rare  due to its extremely low rate of sensitization . in india  north of africa  china  and egypt  
 it is used in weddings and religious ceremonies ; in occident  it is used to dye hair and cosmetics . 
 paraphenylenediamine ( ppd )  a powerful allergen  is added to the henna tattoo mixtures (  black  henna tattoo ) to decrease application time and intensify the color . 
 we describe the case of a 7-year - old boy who reported erythematous papular bulls - eye shaped lesions and consolidated edema primarily in the upper and lower extremities [ figure 1 ] . 
 he also showed an erythematous - eczematous lesion on his leg  shaped like a dolphin [ figure 2 ]  and lesions compatible with erythema multiforme - like reaction . 
 erythematous papular lesions contact eczema in the tattoo area dolphin shaped patch tests were performed  and we observed a high sensitivity after 48 h and moderate after 96 h. we reported a positive reaction to ppd . 
 henna has been used to paint the skin for adornment and religious reasons for 9000 years and in over 60 countries . 
 christians  jews  muslims  hindus  and buddhists have used henna as part of their religious customs . 
 the henna is a flowering plant native to northern africa  western and southern asia in semi - arid zones  used since antiquity to dye skin . 
 it has a great affinity for keratinocytes  and it is used to create temporary tattoos  without it being necessary to puncture the skin . 
 black  henna contains an ingredient in addition to pure henna to achieve its ebony color . in most cases  this added ingredient is ppd  a powerful sensitizer that should not be directly applied to the skin as it may cause mild contact dermatitis . 
 one of the most dangerous applications of this chemical is when it is added to henna because the dye is applied while the ppd is in its oxidation process  and its potential as allergen is increased . when added to henna  the concentration of ppd is often much higher than what is approved for use in hair dyes . 
 the cause of the sensitivity to ppd is unknown ; it is believed that the mechanism involved in the pathogenesis may be a reaction mediated by type iii immune complexes   and associated with type iv retarded hypersensitivity . 
 various topicals allergens cause erythema multiforme  including topical drugs such as corticosteroids  nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs  iodine povidone  imiquimod ; rubber gloves ; nickel and herbicides . 
 three possible causes of the residual hypopigmentation have been described : a reduction in melanin synthesis  selective destruction of the melanocytes  or photoleukomelanodermitis due to pigment blocking . 
 as henna tattoos are becoming increasingly popular  prevention requires the provision of information to consumers  especially young people and their parents . 
 it is important for the population to be aware of this circumstance and the risk entailed by sensitization to ppd . 
 to conclude  we believe that temporary black henna tattooing should be controlled by health authority legislation to minimize the appearance of new cases of reaction to ppd and the serious and permanent consequences we have presented . 
 it is important for the population to be aware of the risk entailed by sensitization to ppd due to popular henna tattoos .","

1) Abstract: A 7-year-old boy developed a rare erythema multiforme-like reaction to a temporary henna tattoo containing paraphenylenediamine (PPD). This case highlights the potential risks of these popular temporary tattoos, especially among children.

2) Research and Discussion: Henna tattoos have become increasingly popular among children, but reactions are rare and usually due to additives like PPD. This case study emphasizes the need for educating consumers, particularly youth and parents, about the potential risks associated with these temporary tattoos.

3) Results and Conclusion: A 7-year-old boy developed an erythema multiforme-like reaction to a temporary henna tattoo containing PPD. This case highlights the importance of educating consumers, especially young people and their parents, about the potential risks associated with henna tattoos and the additives used in them. Increased awareness and knowledge can help prevent similar reactions in the future."
"the romaleidae family accounts for more than 200 species of grasshoppers comprising three subfamilies : romaleinae  aucacrinae and trybliophorinae . 
 it is the second most diverse family of the superfamily acridoidea occurring from semiarid regions to tropical rainforests ( carbonell  1977 ; roberts and carbonell  1982 ; carbonell  1984  1986  2002 ) . 
 the genus radacridium is dispersed across the northeast region of brazil  where it seems to be well - adapted to the severely arid conditions ( carbonell  1984 ) . 
 two species are found in the state of pernambuco : radacridium mariajoseae  which is typical of the agreste region  and radacridium nordestinum  typical of the caatinga biome ( carbonell  1984  1996 ) . 
 cytogenetic studies involving representatives of romaleidae have revealed a great karyotypic conservation ( mesa et al .  1982  2004 ; souza and kido  1995 ; rocha et al .  1997 ; pereira and souza  2000 ) . 
 most of analyzed species  including r. mariajoseae and r. nordestinum  presented karyotypes with 2n = 23 male  24 female  an x0/xx sex chromosome system and exclusively acrocentric chromosomes . 
 the constitutive heterochromatin ( ch ) in romaleidae is predominantly located in the pericentromeric regions of all chromosomes  as observed in xyleus angulatus  brasilacris gigas  chromacris nuptialis  radacridium nordestinum e phaeoparia megacephala ( souza and kido  1995 ; rocha et al .  
 analyses with dapi and cma3 in romaleids showed a predominance of gc - rich ( cma3 ) regions . in xyleus angulatus and xestotrachelus robustus 
 in contrast  few gc - rich ch regions were observed by loreto et al . 
 ( 2005 ) in two chromacris species . c. nuptialis had only one bivalent ( m6 ) with a pericentromeric cma3 block  whereas c. speciosa presented cma3 blocks in two autosomal bivalents  a proximal one in m6 and a telomeric one in l2 . a large part of the eukaryotic genome is formed by repetitive dna  including tandem sequences mainly comprising satellite dna and multigene families . 
 ribosomal dna and histone gene families include a variable number of copies with various genome locations ( charlesworth et al . 
 fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) with rdna and histone genes probes has proven useful for mapping and their location and in clarifying the genome organization of several organisms . among invertebrates  
 rdna gene mapping has been used in several groups  including worms ( vitturi et al .  2002 )  mollusks ( colomba et al .  2002 )  
 insects ( cabrero and camacho  2008 ; cabral - de - mello et al .  2011a ; panzera et al .  2012 )  
 the studies involving histone genes mapping in grasshoppers included some species of the acrididae family ( cabrero et al . 
  2009 ; oliveira et al .  2011 ) and four species of the proscopiidae family ( cabral - de - mello et al .  2011b ) were mapped . 
 this study aimed at understanding the pattern of organization of multigene families in two species of radacridium . 
 our results showed a great variability in the number and location of rdna clusters in both species  whereas the histone h4 genes were highly conserved in number . 
 these results are compared with data from other grasshopper species and are discussed based on the possible mechanisms involved in repetitive dna diversification . 
 we analyzed ten individuals of r. mariajoseae from gravat ( 081204 s ; 353353 w ) and bezerros ( 081400 s ; 354749 w ) and ten adult males of radacridium nordestinum from surubim ( 074959 s ; 354517 w )  all located in the agreste region of the state of pernambuco  brazilian northeast . 
 specimens were processed and their testes were fixed in carnoy solution ( 3:1 ethanol : acetic acid ) . 
 chromosome preparations were obtained by the testicular follicles squashing technique  in one drop of 45% acetic acid . 
 the slides were stained with cma3 ( 0.5 mg / ml ) for one hour  washed with distilled water and stained with da ( distamicine a  0.1 mg / ml ) for 45 min . 
 the slides were rewashed and stained with dapi ( 2 g / ml ) for 20 min and mounted in glycerol / mcilvaine buffer / mgcl2 . 
 probes were obtained by pcr performed according to ayres ( 2002 )  with modifications  using genomic dna from both species and the primers : 18s dnar - sca18s1f ( f 5 - ccc cgt aat cgg aat gag ta - 3 ) ; sca18s1r ( r 5- gag gtt tcc cgt gtt gag tc -3 )  5srdna f(5- aac gac cat acc acg ctg aa -3 ) ; r ( 5- aag cgg 
 tcc ccc atc taa gt - 3 )  histone h4 f-1 ( 5 - tsc gig aya aca tyc agg gia tca c - 3 ) and r-1 ( 5 - cky tti agi gcr tai acc acr tcc at - 3 ) . 
 the pcr products analyzed after electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel had the expected sizes . 
 the 18s rdna and histone h4 probes were labeled with biotin-16-dutp and the 5s rdna probe  with digoxigenin-11-dutp . 
 the chromosome preparations were submitted to an alcohol series pretreatment and then treated with rnase and pepsin . 
 the hybridization mix contained 1 l of probe and the denaturation was performed in a humid chamber at 75 c  followed renaturation overnight at 37 c . 
 immunodetection was performed with mouse anti - biotin ( m743  dako ) and rabbit anti - mouse - tritc ( r270  dako ) for biotin and sheep anti - digoxigenin ( roche 1 207 741 ) and sheep anti - rabbit - fitc ( dako - f0135 ) for digoxigenin . 
 chromosomes were counterstained with 46 diamidine-2-phenyl indole ( dapi ) and the slides were mounted with vectashield ( vector ) . 
 images were obtained in a leica epifluorescence microscope  captured with the cw4000 program ( leica ) and adjusted in adobe photoshop cs5 . 
 radacridium mariajoseae and r. nordestinum presented 2n = 23(male )  a sex determination mechanism of the x0(male ) type and exclusively acrocentric chromosomes . 
 chromosomes of both species were grouped in three large ( l1-l3 )  five medium ( m4-m8 ) and three small ( s9-s11 ) pairs . 
 cma3/da / dapi sequential staining showed gc - rich ( cma3 positive ) constitutive heterochromatin ( ch ) blocks in the interstitial region of only one medium - sized bivalent ( m5 ) and in the pericentromeric region of the x chromosome in r. mariajoseae ( figure 1a ) . in r. nordestinum  
 cma3 blocks were present in the interstitial region of the l2 bivalent and in the pericentromeric region of all chromosomes  except the l1 bivalent ( figure 1c ) . 
 after fish  the 18s rdna probe labeled a single site in the pericentromeric region of the x chromosome in r. mariajoseae ( figure 2a ) and three pericentromeric sites  in the bivalents l2  s9 and s10 of r. nordestinum ( figure 2b ) . 
 the 5s rdna genes were located in the pericentromeric region of the two largest bivalents ( l1 and l2 ) and in the x chromosome of r. mariajoseae  ( figure 2c ) and in the bivalents l2  l3 m4 and m5 of r. nordestinumm ( figure 2d ) . 
 the histone h4 probe was mapped in a proximal location in a medium - sized autosome bivalent ( m5 ) in both species ( figure 2e and f ) . 
 the karyotypic similarities detected after conventional analysis between the two species of radacridium did not extend to their cma3 and dapi staining patterns . 
 our results showed gc - richness ch heterogeneity . in r. mariajoseae only one autosome pair and the x chromosome presented cma3 blocks  which resembled the scarcity in gc - rich regions of other romaleidae  as two species of chromacris with a single cma3 block ( loreto et al .  2005 ) . 
 the presence of a large number of cma3 blocks is more frequent in romaleidae  as observed in xyleus angulatus  phaeoparia megacephala and xestotrachelus robustus  in which all ch was shown to be gc - rich ( souza et al .  1998 ; 
 pereira and souza  2000 ; souza et al .  2003 ) . a great difference in the 18s and 5s rdna distribution 
 r. mariajoseae presented a single 18s rdna site in the x chromosome  confirming the finding of only one active nucleolus organizer region ( nor ) after silver nitrate impregnation ( agno3 ) by rocha et al . ( 1997 ) . 
 although three autosome bivalents showed 18s hybridization signals in r. nordestinum  only the l2 pair had a corresponding active nor identified by rocha et al . 
 these data indicate a possible dispersion of the 18s rdna sequences  which may have been caused by structural chromosome rearrangements  ectopic recombination and transpositions ( cabrero and camacho  2008 ) . these kind of events have been observed in other insects ( nguyen et al .  2010 ; cabral - de - mello et al . 
  the ancestral rdna site could have been present in the m9 bivalent in a common ancestor . 
 two points support this hypothesis : the presence of a 18s rdna site in this pair in r. nordestinum  which was considered as a megameric chromosome by rocha et al . 
 ( 1997 ) and the preferential localization of nors is in this type of chromosome in several species of grasshoppers ( rufas et al .  1985 ) . 
 the 18s rdna probe location in the x chromosome of r. mariajoseae could have resulted from a chromosome rearrangement  such as a translocation or transposition  that moved it from m9 to the x  as a meiotic association between this chromosome and the megameric one has been described ( loreto et al .  2008a ) . 
 18s rdna sites restricted to autosomes  as observed in r. nordestinum  were also detected in xestotrachelus robustus  chromacris nuptialis and c. speciosa ( souza et al . 
 on the other hand  18s rdna sites located both in autosomes and in the sex chromosome have been described  for example  in xyleus discoideus angulatus ( souza et al . 
 18s rdna sites have been frequently observed associated with gc - rich regions in romaleidae ( pereira and souza  2000 ; loreto et al .  2005 )  
 2004 )  proscopiidae ( souza and moura  2000 ) and ommexechidae ( carvalho et al .  2011 )  a pattern also observed in the two species analyzed herein . 
 the histone h4 genes were located in a single chromosome pair ( m5 ) in both species . 
 a single chromosome pair bearing histone genes was also described in other species of grasshoppers . 
 ( 2009 ) analyzed the location of the histone h3 and h4 genes in 35 species of grasshoppers from the acrididae family . 
 they observed that the great majority of species analyzed showed only one histone site  located in an autosome pair . in the same work  
 double fish performed in 11 randomly chosen species revealed that  in all cases  both genes were present in the same chromosome site  indicating a great conservation of histone gene location in acrididae . 
 cabral - de - mello et al . ( 2011b )  using a histone h3 probe in four species of proscopiidae ( tetanorhynchus silvai  scleratoscopia protopeirae  s. spinosa and stiphra robusta )  observed a single site in the m4 bivalent in all the species . 
 oliveira et al . ( 2011 ) observed multiples sites of histone h3 in rhammatocerous brasiliensis ( acrididae ) and concluded that this would be a derived condition and the presence of a single histone site  as observed in both species studied herein  would be the ancestral form . 
 the 5s and the 18s genes co - localized in the l2 chromosome of r. nordestinum and in the x chromosome of r. mariajoseae . 
 similarly to what we observed in both radacridium species  an extensive variation in 5s rdna distribution has been found in others grasshoppers  in which species presenting single sites and extending to all chromosome pairs have been described ( loreto et al .  2008b ; cabral - de - mello et al .  2011a ) . 
 the results obtained in this study indicate a great level of karyotypic differentiation between r. mariajoseae and r. nordestinum . 
 these data reinforce the fact that the high conservation observed at the chromosome level  including chromosome number and morphology  in radacridium and other romaleids  is not reflected at the genomic level . 
 our results also contribute to the understanding of chromosome evolution patterns in the family romaleidae .","

1) Abstract: The study analyzed two species of grasshoppers, Radacridium mariajoseae and R.nordestinum, through various staining and fluorescence techniques to determine the location of specific genes within their chromosomes. The results showed a varied arrangement of chromosome markers and the dispersion of 18s and 5s ribosomal genes throughout the genomes, without a clear correlation.

2) Research and Discussion: The two grasshopper species, R. mariajoseae and R.nordestinum, were analyzed using cma3/da/dapi sequential staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Both species showed karyotypes of 2n = 23, x0 with exclusively acrocentric chromosomes. While R. mariajoseae had cma3 + blocks only in one autosome and the x chromosome, R. nordestinum had them in all chromosomes except one. The FISH analysis revealed the localization of 18s and 5s ribosomal genes in various chromosomes, showing high variability and lack of correlation.

3) Results and Conclusion: The study found that 18s and 5s ribosomal genes are dispersed in the genomes of R. mariajoseae and R.nordestinum, with no significant correlation. Additionally, the location of cma3 + blocks varied between the two species, indicating diverse chromosome markers. These results highlight the importance of utilizing various staining and fluorescence techniques in studying chromosome structure and gene location in different species."
"the relation between chronic subclinical low - grade inflammation and insulin resistance ( ir ) has long been known [ 1  2 ] . 
 ir is the major contributor and mediating factor in the development of type 2 dm ( t2 dm ) along with concomitant hypertension ( ht ) and cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) [ 3  4 ] . 
 the relationship between the development of dm and some markers of inflammation such as c - reactive protein ( crp )  il-6  fibrinogen  and pai-1 has been described previously . 
 serum concentration of crp increases in both impaired glucose tolerance ( igt ) and overt t2 dm [ 3  510 ] . on the other hand 
  some studies reported that elevation of crp is an indicator of development of t2 dm . compared with the conventional ogtt ( 2-hpg ) as recommended by who as gold standard  fasting plasma glucose ( fpg ) and hba1c are more convenient  simpler  and cost - effective diagnostic methods that are currently in use for the diagnosis of t2 dm [ 5  1217 ] . 
 however  each test recognizes people with different metabolic features and groups who may be diagnosed by different tests but do not overlap substantially . while high postchallenge plasma glucose is a strong predictor of cvd  fasting glucose is not an independent predictor of cvd . 
 to the best of our knowledge  there is no previous report specifically comparing the role of hs - crp in people with newly diagnosed dm with the criteria based on the 2-hpg  fpg  and hba1c . 
 therefore  the aim of this study was to identify the optimal cut - off points of hs - crp in new - onset ( previously undiagnosed ) people with dm diagnosed based on the current 2-hpg  fpg  and hba1c diagnostic criteria . in this study 
  hs - crp results obtained from a nationally representative population - based survey are being reported . 
 data derived from  the turkish epidemiology survey of diabetes  hypertension  obesity and endocrine diseases ( turdep - ii )   a population - based study  which was included randomly assigned 26499 adult people from 270 urban and 270 rural centers . 
 the field survey was performed between january and june 2010  with a participation rate of 85% . 
 the study was approved by the local ethical board ( istanbul medical faculty ethical committee  16.4.2008/699 ) . 
 people with known dm or other systemic diseases who had hs - crp levels of 10  mg / l ( 95.2  nmol / l ) or above were excluded from this study due to a possible infection . 
 all biochemical tests including glucose  insulin  and lipid profile were measured in fasting blood samples using roche diagnostics modular autoanalyzer system ( roche diagnostics  germany ) in the central biochemistry laboratory of istanbul medical faculty . 
 concentration of hs - crp was analyzed by immunoturbidimetric assay ( roche / hitachi 912  modular p analyzers : acn 210 ; crpl3 tina - quant c - reactive protein gen . 
 3 ) and hba1c by turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay ; both the system and the laboratory have been regularly certified ( roche diagnostics tq hba1c gen . 
 3 ; ngsp certificate of traceability ; september 2010 - 2011 ) . a detailed medical history of each participant was obtained  and measurements of anthropometry ( height  weight  waist  and hip circumference ) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( sbp  dbp ) were done . 
 body mass index ( bmi )  homa - ir (= fasting glucose  fasting insulin/405 )  and non - hdl - cholesterol (= total cholesterol  hdl - cholesterol ) were calculated accordingly . 
 glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) was estimated using  chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration  ckd - epi equation . 
 risk factors for dm were evaluated using chi - square test ; mean values by sex were compared using nonparametric mann - whitney u test . 
 homogeneity of variance and normal distribution of variables were tested by kolmogorov - smirnov test . 
 pearson correlation coefficients ( r values ) were calculated to assess the association between hs - crp and other laboratory parameters . 
 mean levels of hs - crp in each of the new dm groups were further compared using univariate analysis after being adjusted for age  bmi  smoking and alcohol drinking  and sbp and dbp . 
 an optimum cut - off point of hs - crp was estimated using the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve and area under the curve ( auc ) with 95% cis was calculated for each of the new dm groups that were diagnosed with fpg  126  mg / dl ( 7.0 
 mmol / l )  2-hpg : 200  mg / dl ( 11.1  mmol / l )  or hba1c : 6.5% ( 48  mmol / mol ) [ 13  17 ] . 
 optimum cut - off points of hs - crp were defined for men and women  separately . as the raw data 
 not normally distributed when log transformed  we obtained a square root transformation ( sqrt ) of the hs - crp levels  and after defining the cut - off points we recalculated the squares . 
 data were analyzed using spss for windows ( version 21.0 ; spss / ibm  chicago  il ) . 
 demographic characteristics and laboratory findings of women and men in turdep - ii study are presented in table 1 . in brief  men were significantly older and had higher mean weight  waist circumference  sbp  dbp  triglycerides ( tg )  hdl - cholesterol  and non - hdl - cholesterol values than women . 
 women had significantly higher bmi  hip circumference  heart rate  fpg  hba1c  1-hpg  2-hpg  hdl - cholesterol  and egfr values than men . 
 median ( interquartile range  iqr ) concentration of hs - crp in women was significantly higher than in men ( women  1.85 [ 3.09 ] 
 total serum cholesterol  fasting serum insulin  and homa - ir values did not differ between men and women ( table 1 ) . 
 there was a positive correlation between hs - crp levels and age  bmi  waist  hip  sbp  dbp  pulse  fpg  hba1c  1-hpg  2-hpg  tg  non - hdl - cholesterol  and homa - ir ; and there was a negative correlation with hdl - cholesterol and egfr . 
 when we repeated the analysis after controlling for ht  age  sex  smoking and alcohol use  bmi  and waist circumference  the positive correlations between hs - crp levels and hba1c  1-hpg  2-hpg  tg  non - hdl - cholesterol  egfr  and homa - ir and the negative correlation with hdl - cholesterol and creatinine remained significant ( table 2 ) . among people with new dm  
 the highest hs - crp level was in the group detected by hba1c criterion ( hs - crp median [ iqr ] ; hba1c : 3.45 [ 3.82 ]  mg / dl  32.9 [ 36.4 ]  nmol / l ; 2-hpg : 2.7 [ 3.14 ]  mg / dl  25.4 [ 29.9 ]  nmol / l ; and fpg : 2.4 [ 3.0 ]  mg / dl  22.4 [ 28.5 ]  nmol / l  data not shown ) . 
 high sensitive crp level was significantly higher in women than men with newly diagnosed dm groups based on 2-hpg  fpg  and hba1c criteria . among the newly diagnosed dm groups  the median [ iqr ] level of hs - crp was highest in those detected with hba1c in both genders ( hba1c - group : women : 4.0 [ 4.1 ]  mg / dl  38.4 [ 39.1 ]  nmol / l ; men : 2.7 [ 3.1 ]  mg / dl  25.9 [ 29.1 ]  nmol / l ; fpg group : women : 3.3 [ 4.1 ]  mg / dl  31.1 [ 39.3 ]  nmol / l ; men : 2.4 [ 3.0 ]  mg / dl  22.4 [ 28.5 ]  nmol / l ; and 2-hpg group : women : 2.8 [ 3.3 ]  mg / dl  26.5 [ 31.3 ]  nmol / l ; men : 2.4 [ 2.8 ]  mg / dl  23.3 [ 26.9 ] 
 sex differences in hs - crp did not change after the data adjusted with respect to age  bmi  waist circumference  and ht ; the mean hs - crp was highest in newly diagnosed patients based on hba1c criterion in both sexes . 
 again  the average hs - crp levels of women were higher than men ( table 3 ) . in women with newly diagnosed dm based on fpg  
 mean hs - crp level was comparable to those diagnosed with 2-hpg but lower than the group diagnosed with hba1c ( p = 0.000032 ) . 
 women with newly detected dm based on 2-hpg had also lower mean hs - crp than those detected with hba1c ( p < 0.000001 ) . 
 in contrast  men with newly detected dm based on fpg criterion had lower mean hs - crp than those diagnosed with 2-hpg ( p = 0.017 ) and hba1c ( p = 0.003 ) but mean hs - crp levels were comparable in 2-hpg and hba1c based new dm groups ( table 3 ) . 
 the specificity and sensitivity of the optimal cut - off points for hs - crp to detect dm in women were for the fpg group  60% and 57% for 2.5  mg / l ( 23.6 
 nmol / l )  2-hpg group  60% and 54% for 2.1  mg / l ( 19.7  nmol / l )  and 65% and 64% for hba1c group  2.9  mg / l ( 27.5  nmol / l ) . in men the corresponding specificity and sensitivity values were as follows : fpg group : 60% and 57% for 1.8  mg / l ( 16.9  nmol / l ) ; 2-hpg group : 60% and 57% for 1.8  mg / 
 l ( 16.9  nmol / l ) ; and hba1c group : 65% and 60% for 2.0  mg / l ( 19.0  nmol / l ) ( roc curves figure 1 and table 4 ) . the largest auc value for hs - crp to detect dm was found in women and men when using hba1c ( women : 0.700 ; men : 0.656 ) . the positive and negative predictive values ( ppv and npv ) corresponding to the above - mentioned cut - points of hs - crp in women 
 were calculated as 58% and 59% for fpg  57% and 58% for 2-hpg  and 64% and 65% for hba1c and in men were 58% and 59% for fpg  58% and 59% for 2-hpg  and 61% and 61% for hba1c . 
 our current population - based study identified 1727 people with newly diagnosed dm based on at least one of the three methods . 
 however  the people identified to have dm were substantially different for each of the three methods . 
 in other words  the concordance rate for dm among the different methods of glycaemia testing was low . 
 characteristics of the people with dm and their risk factors may vary by the method used for the detection of dm . 
 several studies have suggested that inflammation is associated with ir that takes part in the pathogenesis of t2 dm and atherosclerotic disease [ 14  6 ] . 
 environmental factors such as infections  overnutrition  and lack of physical activity are believed to contribute serum crp levels although the mechanism is not properly understood . on the other hand  
 hyperglycaemia per se may induce inflammation and this may enhance the development of dm [ 21  22 ] . 
 demonstrated that people who developed dm ( detected by an ogtt ) had higher baseline serum crp levels than those who did not develop dm . 
 there was a linear increasing trend in the incidence of dm as the baseline crp quartile increased . 
 in pizarra prospective study  people with baseline hs - crp 3  mg / l ( 28.6  nmol / l ) developed dm . in our previous report  we demonstrated a linear increasing trend for hs - crp levels from normal glucose tolerance through impaired fasting glucose ( ifg )  igt  and new dm . a recent meta - analysis including 18 prospective studies demonstrated that high baseline crp levels associated with future t2 dm diagnosed based on fpg and/or 2-hpg criteria . 
 all these findings support the chronic low - grade inflammation hypothesis in the development of dm . in our study 
  we found a positive correlation between hs - crp levels and all glycaemia and ir parameters . 
 however  after adjustment for age  sex  smoking  bmi  waist  and ht  positive correlations were maintained with hba1c  1-hpg and 2-hpg  fasting insulin  and homa - ir but not with fpg . in their later report festa et al . stated that postchallenge glucose but not fpg was strongly correlated with baseline crp . 
 other studies have also shown an association between crp and dm  which remained significant after adjusting for bmi or other covariates . 
 our findings and others suggested that adiposity is not sufficient to explain the relationship between high levels of inflammatory markers and increased dm risk . 
 the predictive value of hs - crp did not seem to be fully independent of obesity in several [ 3  23  24  27  28 ] but not all studies [ 7  9  10  22 ] . 
 our results showed that among people with new dm the highest hs - crp levels were obtained in those identified with the hba1c criterion . 
 hba1c elevation at diagnosis is an indication of overt dm  but in a more advanced stage compared with new - onset dm detected with the fpg or 2-hpg criteria . 
 as we did show a positive correlation between hs - crp and hba1c  it has been reported that people with dm with poorer glycaemic control had higher crp levels . 
 some commonly used medications like aspirin and statin may synergistically reduce serum crp concentrations [ 29  30 ] . in the present study  
 we excluded people with known systemic disease and those who self - reported regularly using such medications ; however  we may not ascertain all people using aspirin and/or statin . 
 aronson et al . reported that crp levels among middle - aged people were higher in those with dm and ifg when compared with the healthy subjects . 
 similar to our findings showing women had higher hs - crp levels than men regardless of having dm or not  the adopt investigators have reported that hs - crp levels in women were higher than in men in both with and without the metabolic syndrome ( ms ) . 
 they reported a positive correlation between hs - crp and hba1c  bmi and homa - ir and the number of ms components in people with new dm . 
 in women 's health study  the incidence of dm was four times higher in women with hs - crp levels in the upper quartile in comparison with those with hs - crp levels in the lowest quartile . 
 wu and coworkers reported that high levels of hs - crp were correlated with high levels of hba1c and fpg in men and with only fpg in women . 
 other studies reported strong correlations between hs - crp and fasting insulin  homa - ir  and fpg [ 21  34 ] and an inverse correlation with crp and hdl - cholesterol [ 3  21 ] ; all were confirmed in our study . 
 we estimated the optimal cut - off hs - crp and auc - crp with 95% cis for dm for each of the three diagnostic methods separately . to the best of our knowledge  
 this is the first study aiming at determining hs - crp cut - off points indicating new dm compared with each of the three methods assessing hyperglycaemia . 
 the highest cut - off point for hs - crp was obtained with hba1c based new dm detection compared to fpg and 2-hpg methods . 
 in fact we previously showed that new dm group detected with hba1c has a more advanced metabolic disorder ( higher bmi  waist  blood pressure  non - hdl - cholesterol  triglycerides  and insulin but lower hdl - cholesterol ) than other new dm groups detected with fpg or 2-hpg . den engelsen et al . attempted to find a cut - off point for hs - crp that would indicate the presence of the ms . if hs - crp cut - off point was set at 3  mg / l ( 28.6  nmol / l )  the sensitivity and specificity were 72% and 37% ; at this point ppv and npv were 42% and 67% . in another study performed in a japanese population  a cut - off point of hs - crp of 0.65  mg / l ( 6.2  nmol / l ) for fpg 100  mg / dl ( 5.6  mmol / l ) or higher was capable of defining the ms with a 100% sensitivity and 77% specificity in women and with a 65% sensitivity and 63% specificity in men . in our study the optimum cut - point of hs - crp of 2.5  mg / 
 l ( 23.6  nmol / l ) in women and 1.8  mg / l ( 16.9  nmol / l ) in men for fpg 126  mg / dl ( 7.0  mmol / l ) or higher was capable of defining the new dm with a 60% sensitivity and 57% specificity in both genders . the optimum cut - point for hba1c 6.5% and 
 over was 2.9  mg / l ( 27.5  nmol / l ) in women with a 65% sensitivity and 64% specificity and 2.0  mg / l ( 19.0  nmol / l ) in men with a 60% sensitivity and 62% specificity  and the largest auc value for hs - crp to detect new dm was found in women and men when using hba1c ( women : 0.700 ; men : 0.656 ) . 
 these high cut - off points of crp may be related with the more advanced diabetic state as compared to fpg or 2-hpg based detected cases . 
 one of the greatest strengths of the present study is its national representative sampling with a large sample size and wide age range . 
 in addition  this is the first study where all three currently proposed methods ( 2-hpg  fpg  and hba1c ) were used to define dm and each of them was compared with the inflammation marker  hs - crp . 
 the major limitations are the cross - sectional design and somewhat higher participation rate in women  controlled in the data analyses . in brief  
 an hs - crp level 1.8  mg / l ( 16.9  nmol / l ) generally detects more than half of the people with new dm . 
 external validation of our findings needs to be carried out in additional studies in other populations with reasonably large sample size before these findings can be generalized . 
 our results revealed that hs - crp may not further strengthen the diagnosis of new - onset dm . 
 however  the highest hs - crp among people with new dm was found in those identified with the hba1c criterion . 
 this suggests that high hba1c may recognize new dm cases at a more advanced stage than fpg or 2-hpg in an ogtt . 
 . it would be important to find out if people with newly detected dm with high hs - crp require a more intensive therapy than those with low hs - crp .","


Abstract:
This study aimed to determine optimal levels of high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) based on various diagnostic methods. Data was collected from a population-based survey in Turkey, including 26,499 adult participants. Results suggest that hs-CRP may not significantly improve the diagnosis of new-onset DM.

Research and Discussion:
The mean hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in women compared to men, and in new-onset DM cases diagnosed using the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) method compared to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) methods. However, the cut-off levels of hs-CRP did not differ significantly between the three methods, with similar sensitivity and specificity levels observed. These findings indicate that hs-CRP may not provide additional diagnostic information for new-onset DM.

Results and Conclusion:
The results of this study suggest that hs-CRP may not be a useful marker for diagnosing new-onset DM. However, the highest hs-CRP levels were observed in individuals diagnosed using the HbA1c method, supporting the idea that this method may identify individuals in a more advanced stage of diabetes. Overall, hs-CRP may not have a significant role in the diagnosis of new-onset DM, but further research is needed to confirm these findings."
". they can be caused by mutations in nuclear genes either relating to mitochondrial components or mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) . 
 the prevalence of mitochondrial diseases due to mutations in mtdna and related nuclear genes is estimated to be 1 in 5000 . 
 mutations in mtdna are much higher than those in the related nuclear genes  probably because that mitochondrial genome has been exposed in reactive oxygen species(ros ) and lacked protection structure . in 1990  the adenine to guanine transition at the mtdna position of 3243 encoding trna was found to be the molecular basis for mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke - like episodes ( melas ) . 
 epidemiological studies showed that m.3243a > g mutation is the most frequent pathogenic mutation in mtdna . 
 the prevalence of m.3243a > g mutation in mtdna is 3.5/100000 adults in the north east of england and approximately 1/6000 in an adult population in finland . 
 seizures  encephalopathy  and stroke - like episodes were found in about 80% patients with melas  and short stature  deafness  cognitive impairment  exercise intolerance  migraines  depression  cardiomyopathy  cardiac conduction defects  and diabetes mellitus were also found in some melas cases . here  we summarized the clinical spectrum of m.3243a > g mutation in chinese pediatric patients  to define the common clinical manifestations and study the correlation between heteroplasmic degree of the mutation and clinical severity of the disease . 
 clinical data of 100 chinese pediatric patients who were first diagnosed as mitochondrial diseases through gene test for m.3243a > g mutation in peking university first hospital from 2007 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed . 
 this study was approved by the medical ethics committee of peking university first hospital ( no . 
 a total of ten clinical characteristics including vision impairment  hearing loss  encephalopathy  myopathy  and gastrointestinal disturbances were collected from these patients . 
 short stature was defined as the body height less than two standard deviations below the mean height of normal children . 
 the peripheral blood samples were collected from these patients when they were first screened for the gene mutation . 
 detection of m.3243a > g mutation ratio was performed by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr)-restriction fragment length polymorphism method . 
 the pcr product was digested with restriction enzyme apa i  and then separated in 2% agarose gel . 
 the patients were divided into three groups based on mutation ratio ( low level : 030% ; middle level : 3160% ; and high level : 61100% ) . 
 age and mutation ratio inconsistent with gaussian distribution were presented as median ( q1  q3 ) . 
 correlation between m.3243a > g mutation ratio and age was evaluated with spearman 's rank correlation method . 
 the differences in clinical symptom frequency of patients with low  middle  and high levels of mutation ratio were analyzed by chi - square test .

 the m.3243a > g mutation ratio in peripheral leukocytes was determined in all the patients  and 32% of them had a mutation ratio above 50% . 
 the relationship between m.3243a > g mutation ratio and onset age was analyzed by spearman 's rank correlation method  which showed that m.3243a > g mutation ratio was correlated negatively with onset age [ r = 0.470  p < 0.001 ; figure 1 ] . 
 correlation between m.3243a > g mutation ratio in peripheral leukocytes and onset age ( r=0.470  n=100 ) .

 correlation between m.3243a > g mutation ratio in peripheral leukocytes and onset age ( r=0.470  n=100 ) . 
 the differences in clinical symptom frequency among patients with low  middle  and high levels of mutation ratio were analyzed by chi - square test [ table 1 ] . 
 there were significant differences in the frequencies of hearing loss  decreased vision  myopathy  and gastrointestinal disturbance among three groups . 
 however  patients with a low or middle level of m.3243a > g mutation ratio were more likely to suffer from hearing loss  decreased vision  and gastrointestinal disturbance than high level group . 
 analysis of clinical symptom frequency in different distributions of 3243a > g mutation ratio  n low level : a mutation ratio range 030% ; middle level : a mutation ratio range 3160% ; high level : a mutation ratio range 61100% ; mri : magnetic resonance imaging ; ct : computed tomography . 
 the m.3243a > g mutation has been shown to lead to reduced levels of the trna  decrease in aminoacylation  and absence of the normal modification with 5-taurinomethyl group at the wobble base . 
 mitochondrial disease caused by this mutation may result from the reduction of mtdna - encoded proteins and oxidative phosphorylation activity in mitochondrial translation . 
 several clinical syndromes including melas  myoclonic epilepsy with ragged - red fibers  chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia  and leigh 's syndrome may associate with m.3243a > g mutation . 
 patients with m.3243a > g mutation but without clinical symptoms are not uncommon . to define the spectrum of clinical manifestations due to m.3243a > g mutation 
  we retrospectively reviewed clinical data of 100 chinese pediatric patients with m.3243a > g mutation regardless of their clinical presentations . 
 central nervous system ( cns ) is frequently involved in mitochondrial diseases because of its higher energy demand . 
 seizures may result from neuronal energy depletion  oxidative stress  impaired calcium signaling  immune disturbances  and deficiencies of vitamins  cofactors  and amino acids . in this study  
 the prevalence of seizures was as high as 76%  and was nearly 100% in our previous study  similar to the prevalence of 70.5% in a report of pediatric mitochondrial disease from taiwan  china . 
 cns symptoms are  therefore  more common and severe in children than adults . the prevalence of seizures ranged from 9% to 20% in adults . in melas patients  recurrent stroke - like episodes were more frequent in those with m.3243a > g mutation than those without the mutation . 
 we found stroke - like episodes in 22% patients  higher than the prevalence from patients with mitochondrial mutations other than m.3243a > g mutation . 
 most of our patients showed abnormal brain image findings were probably not due to vascular injuries . 
 bilateral basal ganglia were the most vulnerable site in this disease  followed by temporal  parietal  and occipital area  similar to the previous report . 
 chae et al . also observed the tendency that basal ganglia were frequently involved in patients without m.3243a > g mutation . 
 vomiting was more frequent than constipation or / and diarrhea  and 68% vomiting cases were complicated with headaches . a higher prevalence ( 42% ) of these symptoms 
 therefore  mitochondrial diseases should be considered clinically in children with unexplained vomiting and headaches . 
 the prevalence of cardiac involvement was highly variable in patients with mtdna mutations  ranging from 17% to 40% . 
 in this study  35% patients exhibited cardiac involvement with the main manifestations of abnormal electrocardiogram ( 17% ) and left ventricular hypertrophy ( 8% ) . 
 the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy was less in our patients than the patients with m.3243a > g mutation ( 56% ) reported by majamaa - voltti et al . 
 pediatric patients may be the reason of that lower prevalence of cardiac involvement was present in this study . for patients suspected of mitochondrial disease  routine electrocardiogram  and ultrasonocardiography 
 the m.3243a > g mutation ratio in peripheral leukocytes was negatively correlated with patients onset age . 
 myopathy was frequently seen in patients with high level of m.3243a > g mutation ratio . 
 however  patients with a low or middle level of m.3243a > g mutation ratio were more likely to suffer from hearing loss  decreased vision  and gastrointestinal disturbance . in conclusion  this study summarized the common symptoms and onset symptoms in a large cohort of chinese pediatric patients with m.3243a > g mutation . in view of the fact that the diagnosis of 66% of patients was delayed an average of 2 years 
  we suggested that examination of m.3243a > g mutation in mtdna should be considered in children with one or more of the symptoms including seizures  short stature  muscle weakness  headache complicated with vomiting  decreased vision  and hearing loss . 
 although the mutation ratio in blood sample is an available test for diagnosis of mitochondrial disease  the m.3243a > g mutation ratio is usually higher in muscle and urine sample . 
 therefore  the mutation ratio in other tissues  such as muscle and urine cell  should be included in the future study .

1) Title: Abstract 
This study aimed to summarize the clinical characteristics of Chinese pediatric patients with m.3243a > g mutation in mitochondrial disease, including clinical features and heteroplasmic degree. Results show a high prevalence of delayed diagnosis and common symptoms such as seizures and short stature. 
2) Title: Research and Discussion 
Retrospective data of 100 Chinese pediatric patients with m.3243a > g mutation in mitochondrial disease were analyzed. The study found a negative correlation between mutation ratio and age, with higher ratios resulting in more severe symptoms such as myopathy. Patients with lower mutation ratios were more likely to present with symptoms such as hearing loss, decreased vision, and gastrointestinal disturbance. 
3) Title: Results and Conclusion 
Results revealed that symptoms such as seizures, short stature, and abnormal MRI/CT changes were prevalent in Chinese pediatric patients with m.3243a > g mutation. It is recommended for patients presenting with these recurrent symptoms to undergo screening for this mutation. Additionally, careful monitoring of clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities is necessary for patients with this point mutation."
"prolonged exposure to microgravity has significant effects on physiological conditions . many studies have investigated the effects of microgravity on the neuromuscular system . 
 most of these studies have focused on skeletal muscle changes under microgravity . however  to the best of our knowledge  there is limited research regarding the effects of microgravity on the peripheral nervous system . 
 one study examined the conduction velocity ( cv ) in branching axon terminals following a space mission or bed rest and identified a decreased cv ; however  it did not measure the velocity in the main trunk of nerve fibers . 
 for example  one study investigated the manifestation of somatosensory - evoked potentials under hypokinesia  which included both the peripheral and central sensory nervous systems . 
 however  the conditions under hypokinesia / bed rest are different compared with microgravity ; therefore  the effect of microgravity on the peripheral nervous system should be further evaluated . 
 ground - based models are a suitable alternative to space flights and induce similar modifications in the neuromuscular system . 
 the hindlimb unloading ( hu ) model is characterized by the absence of weightbearing and reduced motor activity  and it is typically applied in rats . moreover 
  the 6 head - down tilt ( hdt ) is another experimental model used to simulate the space flight environment of humans . to determine changes in nerve conduction under simulated microgravity  the current study aimed to investigate the nerve conduction characteristics of rhesus monkeys before and after prolonged exposure to hdt . 
 all experimental procedures conducted with rhesus monkeys were approved by the ethical committee of the china astronaut research and training center  which is in accordance with the principles of the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international ( aaalac )  approved by institutional animal care and use committee ( iacuc ) . 
 the hdt model in rhesus monkeys was selected as the model because the peripheral nervous system of primates is the most similar to humans compared with other species . 
 six rhesus monkeys at the age of 34 years ( three males and three females ) were laid on beds  which were tilted backward 6 from the horizontal . 
 the head - down animals wore a special cloth  which enabled them to be fixed to the bed ; however  their arms and legs were free to move  and they were provided access to food and water . 
 the hdt model functions to reduce mechanical loading to the hindlimbs  which provides a similar condition as microgravity . 
 the rhesus monkeys were provided with a regular dietary program  which included primate biscuits  fresh fruits  and vitamin syrup . 
 the animals were housed one per cage or bed in rooms with air temperature maintained at 23  2c and a standard 12:12 h dark  light cycle ( lights were turned on at 8:00 a.m. and off at 8:00 p.m. ) . the general health condition of the animals was carefully monitored . 
 the monkeys were provided with toys ( for example  the drum - shaped rattle  a chinese traditional toy ) during housing throughout the duration of the study  and the toys were available all the time except during experimental procedures . 
 nerve conduction studies ( ncss ) were performed using surface electrodes on the median  ulnar  tibial  and fibular nerves on the right side to assess motor function in the upper and lower limbs using the key point electromyography system ( 31a06  medoc ltd .  
 the motor conduction velocities  the proximal and distal amplitudes of the compound muscle action potentials ( cmaps )  and the proximal and distal latencies of the median  ulnar  tibial  and fibular nerves were recorded ( representative images of the ncs of the tibial nerve are shown in figure 1 ) . 
 the ncs was performed in the order of the median  ulnar  tibial  and fibular nerves before hdt and on 7  21  and 42 days of hdt . during the procedure  
 toys were provided  and the researchers accompanied the monkeys to reduce pain and suffering . 
 all animal housing and experiments occurred in the animal facility at china astronaut research and training center . 
 ncs : nerve conduction studies ; hdt : head - down tilt . statistical analysis was performed using spss software version 19.0 ( ibm  chicago  il  usa ) . 
 analysis of variance ( anova ) using a randomized block design was conducted to compare the differences in the ncs before hdt and at 7  21  and 42 days of hdt . 
 post hoc analyses  including least significant difference and student  newman  keuls  were performed if significant differences were identified in the anova . 
 one rhesus monkey died on the day 21 of hdt because of inadaptation to the simulated microgravity  and one monkey injured its upper limbs as a result of rigorous movement . 
 thus  the anova with a randomized block design and the anova of the median and ulnar nerve parameters were performed using data collected from the remaining four rhesus monkeys . 
 data from the tibial and fibular nerves were obtained from the five remaining rhesus monkeys .

 data from the tibial and fibular nerves were obtained from the five remaining rhesus monkeys . 
 the parameters of ncs before hdt ( under normal conditions ) and 7  21  and 42 days of hdt are presented in table 1 . 
 the proximal amplitude of the cmap of the median nerve was significantly decreased at 21 and 42 days of hdt compared with the amplitude before hdt ( 4.38  2.83 vs. 8.40  2.66 mv  f = 4.85  p = 0.013 and 3.30  2.70 vs. 8.40  2.66 mv  f = 5.93  p = 0.004  respectively ) . 
 the proximal amplitude of the cmap of the median nerve at 42 days of hdt was significantly decreased compared with that at 7 days of hdt ( 3.30  2.70 vs. 7.70  1.50 mv  f = 4.40  p = 0.022 ) . 
 ncs before and at 7  21  and 42 days of hdt in rhesus monkeys ( n = 6 ) data represent means  sds . * for the median nerve  statistically different versus the proximal cmap before hdt ; for the median nerve  statistically different versus distal cmap before hdt ; for the tibial nerve  statistically different versus the proximal cmap before hdt ; for the median nerve  statistically different versus the proximal cmap 7 days of hdt ; for the median nerves  statistically different versus distal cmap 7 days of hdt ; for the tibial nerve  statistically different versus the proximal cmap 7 days of hdt . 
 ncs : nerve conduction study ; hdt : head - down tilt ; mcv : motor conduction velocity ; cmap : compound muscle action potential ; sds : standard deviations . 
 the distal amplitude of the cmap of the median nerve was significantly decreased at 7  21  and 42 days of hdt compared with the amplitude before hdt ( 7.28  1.27 vs. 10.25  3.40 mv  f = 4.03  p = 0.039 ; 5.05  2.01 vs. 10.25  3.40 mv  f = 6.25  p = 0.04 ; and 3.95  2.79 vs. 10.25  3.40 mv  f = 7.35  p = 0.01  respectively ) . 
 the distal amplitude of the cmap of the median nerve at 42 days of hdt was significantly decreased compared with that at 7 days of hdt ( 3.95  2.79 vs. 7.28  1.27 mv  f = 3.33  p = 0.08 ) . 
 the proximal amplitude of the cmap of the tibial nerve was significantly decreased at 42 days of hdt compared with the amplitude before hdt ( 6.14  1.94 vs. 11.87  3.19 mv  f = 5.02  p = 0.039 ) . 
 the proximal amplitude of the cmap of the tibial nerve at 42 days of hdt was significantly decreased compared with that at 7 days of hdt ( 6.14  1.94 vs. 12.98  4.99 mv  f = 6.84  p = 0.008 ) . 
 the proximal and distal latencies of the nerves and the nerve cvs were prolonged and decreased slightly compared with the parameters before hdt but were not significantly different . 
 previous studies regarding the effects of microgravity on the neuromuscular system have mainly focused on muscle atrophy induced by muscle disuse . 
 few studies have investigated the electrophysiological characteristics of the peripheral nervous system after prolonged microgravity . 
 the current investigation focused on the electrophysiological characteristics of the peripheral nervous system and identified a significant decrease in the proximal and distal amplitudes of the cmap of the median and tibial nerves as early as day 7 of hdt . 
 previous research identified a longer duration and a slower falling rate of the action potentials of muscle fibers  thereby reflecting a change in the motor fiber impulses of its nerve  which may contribute to the decreased amplitude . 
 furthermore  atypical combinations of myosin heavy chain mrna isoforms have been demonstrated to be transiently increased in the soleus fibers of rats that experienced 7 days of hu  which suggests a disruption of transcriptional and translational activity . 
 these changes were present at a very early stage and may explain the cmap amplitude decrease in the ncs identified in the current study . 
 furthermore  as the recording surface electrodes were attached at the muscle belly  a decrease in muscle power and muscle atrophy may contribute to the cmap amplitude decrease of the median and tibial nerves . 
 however  there were no significant differences in the proximal and distal amplitudes of the cmap of the ulnar and fibular nerves at 42 days of hdt . 
 the reason for this finding may be that 42 days of hdt is not sufficient to produce dramatic differences . studies of rats under microgravity have typically lasted for 14 days or less  and significant changes in multiple parameters such as the nerve cv and axon diameter have been identified . in humans  
 primates most closely resemble humans ; however  42 days of hdt was likely not sufficient to induce similar changes . 
 moreover  one study demonstrated that the equilibrium state in rats shifted to a different level at 14 days of hu . 
 the transitional period between these two equilibrium states may have been marked by a transitory disorganization . 
 we infer that the electrophysiological characteristics of peripheral nerves were under a transitory disorganization on day 42 of hdt . 
 thus  the amplitudes of the cmap of the ulnar and peroneal nerves did not exhibit significant decreases . 
 . a significant decrease in the cv of muscle fibers and a reduction in the cv in branching axon terminals were previously identified . in this study  
 the latencies of the nerves and the nerve cvs were not significantly different after hdt . 
 the mechanisms that modulate the cv in nerve fibers are not clear  and changes in the membrane properties at the nodes of ranvier may represent one factor that plays a role in this modulation . 
 changes in the membrane properties may be induced through modifications in the synthesis of voltage - gated membrane channels in excitable muscle membranes . 
 wittwer et al . demonstrated gene expression alterations following prolonged unloading of rat soleus muscles . 
 there was an increase in the mrnas that coded for ion channels  which may elucidate the increased shortening velocity of the soleus muscle following spaceflight . in our study  
 the most likely explanations for the lack of change in the latencies of the nerves and nerve cvs following hdt were that the 42 days of exposure to hdt was not sufficient to generate significant changes  and the electrophysiological characteristics of the peripheral nerve fibers were under a transitory disorganization . 
 furthermore  to the best of our knowledge  the nerve cv depends on the axonal diameter  myelin sheath thickness  and internodal distance . 
 previous research indicates that although myelin was thinner following hu  the mean axonal diameter for the small fibers was slightly decreased in hu rats ; in contrast  it was not significantly different for the large fibers  which were in charge of motor function  and the distances between the nodes of ranvier and the global structure of the nerve fibers were not significantly different . 
 moreover  the current findings are consistent with previous research regarding fatigue  in which the cv along nerve fibers was not substantially reduced . in this study  rhesus monkeys were subjected to hdt to resemble the space flight environment  which is a model of substantial value in the investigation of microgravity effects on astronauts . 
 experiments that involve astronauts  including ground - based experiments  are expensive  and the impact of microgravity on the motor function of astronauts is often minimized through countermeasures . 
 furthermore  the pretest conditions of astronauts are challenging to control ; thus  the potential heterogeneity may impact the reliability of the findings . moreover  although studies have evaluated changes in muscle fibers and axon terminals under microgravity  few studies have investigated these variables in nerve trunks . 
 the current findings provide novel evidence related to the electrophysiological characteristics of nerve trunks under microgravity . despite the importance of the experimental model and findings identified in this study  
 thus  future studies with a larger sample size and a longer duration of hdt are necessary to confirm these findings . 
 conclusively  this study demonstrates that the cmap amplitudes of nerves are decreased under hdt in rhesus monkeys . 
 moreover  results of the present study suggest that rhesus monkeys exposed to hdt might be used as an experimental model for the study of ncs under microgravity .

1) Abstract: This study examined nerve conduction characteristics of rhesus monkeys before and after simulated microgravity using the 6 head-down tilt (hdt) model. Results showed decreased compound muscle action potential amplitudes after 21 and 42 days of hdt, indicating potential nervous system changes due to microgravity.
2) Research and Discussion: Conducted on six 34-year-old rhesus monkeys, this study compared nerve conduction studies (ncss) before and after 6 hdt. Findings suggest that prolonged exposure to hdt can lead to decreased compound muscle action potential amplitudes in the median, ulnar, tibial, and fibular motor nerves, making rhesus monkeys a valuable model for studying ncs under microgravity.
3) Results and Conclusion: After 21 and 42 days of hdt, the proximal and distal amplitudes of the compound muscle action potentials in the median and tibial nerves were significantly decreased. This demonstrates the potential impact of simulated microgravity on the nervous system in rhesus monkeys. Overall, these findings highlight the usefulness of hdt as an experimental model for studying nerve conduction under microgravity."
"a 55 year - old man visited our emergency department because of increasing frequency of chest pain . 
 he had undergone off - pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ) 10 years ago because of unstable angina associated with three vessel coronary artery disease . at the initial operation  the in situ right internal thoracic artery ( ita )  
 in situ left ita and in situ right gastroepiploic artery ( rgea ) grafts were used to revascularize the left anterior descending coronary artery  two obtuse marginal coronary branches  and posterior descending coronary artery  respectively . 
 an excess segment of the distal right ita was connected to the side of left ita as a y - composite graft and anastomosed to the first diagonal coronary artery . 
 coronary angiography and myocardial single photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) were performed at 5 years after surgery as a follow - up study . 
 the 5-year angiography showed all patent grafts and the myocardial spect demonstrated no perfusion decrease . 
 exertional chest pain recurred at 7 years after surgery  and a repeated coronary angiography showed patent previous grafts including faint visualization of the in situ rgea graft associated with significant stenosis at the os of the celiac axis . 
 the computed tomographic angiogram also demonstrated a 90% stenosis at the celiac os  which had been without stenosis on abdominal angiography taken before the surgery ( fig . 
 redo off - pump cabg was performed 10 years after the initial surgery because of an increasing frequency of angina and an aggravated finding of the follow - up myocardial spect  which was a newly developed reversible perfusion decrease in the inferior wall ( fig . 
  the great saphenous vein was harvested from the lower leg and interposed between the middle part of in situ right ita and distal part of in situ rgea grafts used previously  to supply blood flow from the right ita graft to the posterior descending coronary artery . 
 one year after redo surgery  the patient had no symptoms of angina and coronary angiogram was performed and revealed patent grafts  including an interposed saphenous vein graft ( fig . 
 3a ) . the myocardial spect test was also performed and demonstrated that there was no perfusion decrease including the inferior wall ( fig . 
 reoperations for coronary artery disease have been increased due to the increased number of isolated cabg . 
 the society of thoracic surgeons statistics indicated that nearly 5% of the current cabg procedures done in the us were repeat surgical revascularization . 
 angiographic indications for reoperation are progression of native coronary atherosclerosis  previous graft failure or a combination of both . 
 one previous study demonstrated that 4 out of 400 patients who underwent cabg using the rgea graft needed percutaneous interventions due to the rgea graft failure during postoperative follow - up of 2211 months . 
 one of those 4 patients required an angioplasty for a newly developed stenosis of the celiac trunk . in the present case  an indication for reoperation 
 the patient had been free of angina  and the angiographic and myocardial spect follow - up studies revealed no abnormal findings at postoperative 5 years . 
 when the patient suffered from recurred angina at postoperative 7 years  coronary angiography showed a faint visualization of the in situ rgea graft associated with significant stenosis at the os of the celiac axis . 
 the 10-year follow - up myocardial spect test demonstrated a newly developed reversible perfusion decrease in the inferior wall . 
 the prevalence of celiac axis stenosis was 7.3% in a korean population although it was lower than the previously reported incidence of celiac axis stenosis in western populations ranged from 12.5% to 24% . in the present case  
 celiac artery stenting could be an alternative option in such a case . however  we performed a redo operation because celiac axis stenting was associated with a high incidence of late restenosis . 
 the aorta or another in situ arterial graft could be chosen as a blood source . 
 alternatively  patent in situ grafts used previously may be re - used as an inflow conduit . with regards to our patient  the 3 in situ arterial grafts had already been used . 
 the saphenous vein graft was interposed between the middle part of right ita and distal part of in situ rgea grafts used previously .","

1) Abstract: This case report describes a successful redo coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in a 55-year-old man with recurrent angina. The redo-CABG was performed 10 years after the initial surgery due to aggravated symptoms and decreased perfusion. The patient's symptoms were relieved and myocardial perfusion was improved following the procedure.

2) Research and Discussion: Recurrent angina 7 years after initial coronary artery bypass grafting prompted further investigation, which revealed a partially occluded in situ right gastroepiploic artery graft and stenosis of the celiac axis. This case highlights the importance of regular follow-up and identification of graft failure or stenosis in patients with prior CABG. 

3) Results and Conclusion: The redo-CABG procedure involved interposing a saphenous vein graft between the previously used in situ grafts, resulting in improved symptoms and myocardial perfusion. This highlights the potential benefit of using multiple arterial grafts in initial CABG surgeries. Regular follow-up and timely intervention can improve outcomes in patients undergoing CABG. "
"to report a case of inadvertent anterior chamber and cornea stromal injection with high dose antibiotics and steroids during cataract operation . 
 during cataract operation on a 78 year - old female patient  high dose gentamicin ( 20 mg/0.5 ml ) and dexamethasone ( 2 mg/0.5 ml ) were inadvertently injected into the anterior chamber and cornea stroma when making cornea edema for sealing of the incision sites . 
 on postoperative day one  extensive cornea edema was noted  and best - corrected visual acuity was 0.2 . 
 postoperatively  corneal edema fully resolved  and best - corrected visual acuity was 0.8 . 
 however  some descemet 's membrane folds still remained  and a decrease in the number of endothelial cells was noted by specular microscope . 
 in this case involving anterior chamber and cornea stromal injection with high dose antibiotics and steroids  immediate anterior chamber irrigation with balanced salt solution seemed an appropriate management  and the patient 's long - term visual acuity appears good . to prevent such mistakes  precise labeling of all solutions and use of different syringe needles should be considered . 
 a 78 year - old woman underwent extracapsular cataract extraction with phacoemulsification via temporal clear corneal and a single superior side port incision . 
 an intraocular lens was inserted in the bag  and viscoelastic materials were removed by irrigation and aspiration  without any complications . at the end of the operation  the nurse inadvertently handed over the wrong syringe and  and high dose antibiotics and steroids were inadvertently injected into the anterior chamber and corneal stroma through a 19 g needle during the stromal hydration procedure for wound closure at the incision sites . the antibiotics and steroids given were gentamicin ( 20 mg/0.5 ml ) and dexamethasone ( 2 mg/0.5 ml )  originally prepared for subconjunctival injection . 
 about 10 seconds after the injection  we recognized the mistake  and the anterior chamber was irrigated with 100ml of a balanced salt solution ( cytosol ophthalmicstm ) for one minute . on postoperative day one  the patient complained of blurred vision and foreign body sensations . 
 severe corneal edema and descemet 's membrane folds invading the visual axis were seen extending from the 12 to 4 o'clock position ( fig . 
 best - corrected visual acuity was 0.2  and intraocular pressure was 18 mmhg by noncontact tonometer . 
 postoperatively  cravit ( levofloxacin 0.5%  santen  osaka  japan )  1% prednisolone  and 5% nacl were administered every two hours . 
 oral prednisolone ( 20 mg ) and ofloxacin ( 300 mg ) were used as well . a pressure patch with ofloxacin and dexamethasone ointment 
 the corneal edema persisted until postoperative day three  and the best - corrected visual acuity decreased to 0.15 . 
 the vision improved to 0.4 after two weeks  but the corneal edema persisted without improvement . 
 the patient continued with the original and medications and dosages . on the third postoperative week  the best - corrected visual acuity stabilized at 0.4  and the corneal edema began to resolve . 
 the visual acuity continued to improve to 0.7  and the corneal edema finally resolved four weeks postoperatively . 
 however  the linear descemet 's membrane folds persisted up to postoperative week 16 ( fig . 2  3 ) . 
 at the same site of the descemet 's membrane fold  corresponding endothelial damage was also observed  manifesting as a definite dark acelluar area on specular microscopy ( fig . 
 4 ) . the preoperative endothelial cell density on specular microscopy was 2717 cells / mm and the mean cell size was 368 m . at postoperative month three  
 the mean cell size was 424 m and endothelial cell density had decreased to 2358 cells / mm . 
 no other changes were observed after that  and the best - corrected visual acuity improved to 0.8 at postoperative month four . 
 almost every ocular drug can be potentially toxic to the corneal endothelium  and the risk of endothelial toxicity is increased when used in the anterior chamber because of its direct contact to the endothelium . 
 corneal endothelium is vulnerable even to osmotic change or ph change of the irrigating fluid  and is easily damaged by electrolyte imbalance . 
 moreover  permanent endothelial dysfunction  cystoid macular edema  pupil dilation  and glaucoma due to destruction of trabecular meshwork can occur and have been reported in severe cases.8 - 10 therefore  it is important to control the concentration of the solution when antibiotics are added to the irrigating solution in order to prevent postoperative endophthalmitis.124 however  the exact nontoxic concentrations of the antibiotics and steroids have not been fully investigated . 
 montan et al.11 studied doses and exposure durations of cefuroxime when injected in the anterior chamber  reporting that 1 mg/0.1 ml of cefuroxime is safe and maintains a high concentration for one hour postoperatively . 
 kang et al.12 studied gentamicin toxicity in different concentrations on three types of human corneal cells under culture and suggested that the safe local concentration of gentamicin for endothelial and stromal cell was 1 mg / ml in the human eye . with increasing concentration of gentamicin ( from 2 mg / ml to 4 mg / ml )  
 the toxicity of gentamicin to the corneal cells was in direct proportion to its concentration and duration of incubation . 
 petroutsos et al.13 reported that endothelial toxicity occurred when 1 mg / ml of gentamicin was injected into the anterior chamber in rabbit eyes . 
 medin14 used a weight recording system to demonstrate the possible toxic effect of gentamicin on the endothelium of rabbit corneas stored in organ culture . 
 lin et al.15 reported that 15% cell damage was found in tissue cultured bovine endothelial cells when exposed to 1.6 mg / ml of gentamicin . 
 when the concentration of gentamicin was doubled  cell damage reached 40%  and the recovery of cellular morphology was much slower . 
 mester and stein16 studied the effect of gentamicin concentration on rabbit endothelial cells and reported that 0.50% gentamicin was toxic to endothelium  but 0.25% gentamicin was not significantly different as compared to the control . besides irreversible damage to the corneal endothelium and corneal edema 
  high concentrations of gentamicin solutions can induce retinal hemorrhage  edema  and obliteration of the retinal vasculature when injected in the vitreous  resulting in optic atrophy  retinal pigment degeneration  or neovascular glaucoma.1718 in our case  the toxicity of the gentamicin to the corneal endothelium was expected to be significant due to the fact that the concentration of the gentamicin injected in anterior chamber and corneal stroma was 40 times more than that of previously mentioned studies . wang et al.19 tested the cytotoxicity of five antibiotics ( amphotericin - b  colistin - m  sulbenicillin  amikacin  cephradine ) and a steroid ( betamethasone ) to cultured porcine corneal endothelial cells and demonstrated that the steroid was less toxic to the endothelium than other antibiotics . in our case  
 the inadvertent injection of antibiotics and steroids resulted in severe corneal edema from 12 to 4 o'clock position involving the visual axis  along with extensive descemet 's membrane folds . 
 we used a hypertonic solution of about 1720 osm / l ( 5% nacl ) topically to reduce the stromal edema . 
 this concentration is known to be nontoxic2021 and the solution was effective in our case . 
 on postoperative week 12  the descemet 's membrane folds were observed by specular microscopy and persisted 16 weeks after the operation . in our case  corneal edema and the descemet 's membrane fold were probably due to inadvertent corneal stromal injection with high dose gentamicin and dexamethasone rather than injection directly into the anterior chamber . 
 the duration of exposure and the concentration of the drugs were negligible  due to prompt irrigation of the anterior chamber with balanced salt solution . 
 we found the localized endothelial defect on specular microscopy manifesting as a definite dark acelluar area  which corresponded to the area of the descemet 's membrane fold and site of inadvertent stromal injection . also  irrigation with a balanced salt solution 
 might play a role in causing corneal edema . on postoperative week four  the corneal edema resolved  and best corrected visual acuity improved to 0.7 . 
 our case showed relatively good visual prognosis despite the high concentration of the injected antibiotics and steroids . 
 this favorable outcome might be due to the immediate irrigation of the anterior chamber with balanced salt solution . 
 as such  long - term endothelial exposure to high dose antibiotics and steroid can be avoided . 
 the immediate irrigation was possible because the balanced salt solution was prepared before the operation . 
 hansany and basu22 demonstrated that a 0.1 mg / ml concentration of gentamicin was not toxic to the corneal endothelium until seven days postop  but after seven days corneal endothelial toxicity was demonstrated for that concentration . 
 this study suggested that duration of drug exposure ( rather than drug concentration ) is also an important factor for corneal endothelial damage . 
 therefore  considering our case and this study  we can conclude that immediate irrigation of the anterior chamber is important in preventing corneal endothelial damage when high dose antibiotics and steroids are injected in anterior chamber by mistake during cataract or other intraocular surgery . to dilute the intrastromal antibiotics and steroids 
  we considered stromal injection of a balanced salt solution  but this was not performed because separation of descemet 's membrane from stroma can occur . 
 mcdonald et al.23 insisted that clear communication between the surgeon and nursing staff  in addition to precise labeling of every injectable solution  is necessary to prevent accidents  such as this . 
 in addition  it is wise to draw up injectable antibiotics just before injection  and to use different gauge needles for the different solutions  which could easily be recognized by physician under the microscope . in our case 
  we reported a favorable visual outcome with immediate irrigation of the anterior chamber with a balanced salt solution after the inadvertent injection of high dose antibiotics and steroids . 
 however  to prevent such an accident during surgery  strict precautions ( mentioned previously ) and clear communication between surgeons and nursing staff  including scrub nurses  are considered to be of great importance .","

1)Abstract: A case study of inadvertent anterior chamber and cornea stromal injection with high dose antibiotics and steroids during cataract surgery is reported. Immediate anterior chamber irrigation with balanced salt solution was administered, resulting in resolution of cornea edema and good long-term visual acuity for the patient.
 
2)Research and Discussion: A 78-year-old female patient underwent cataract surgery with high dose gentamicin and dexamethasone inadvertently injected into the anterior chamber and cornea stroma. Topical medication was started and four weeks postoperatively, cornea edema began to reduce significantly with full resolution at four months. Descemet's membrane folds and decrease in endothelial cells were also noted.
 
3)Results and Conclusion: Immediate irrigation and follow-up treatment resulted in successful resolution of cornea edema and good long-term visual acuity for the patient. To prevent such errors, precise labeling of solutions and use of different syringe needles should be considered in future cases. "
"autosomal - dominant polycystic kidney disease ( adpkd ) is characterized by cyst formation and occurs primarily in the kidneys . due to the replacement of the normal renal parenchyma  adpkd results in end - stage renal failure in 45% of patients . 
 approximately 711% of patients receiving renal replacement therapy in the western world are doing so due to adpkd . 
 the underlying cause of adpkd is a mutation in the polycystin-1 and -2 plasma proteins  located in the primary cilia . 
 this mutation leads to abnormal function of renal tubular epithelia and inadequate calcium influx followed by cyst formation . 
 cardiovascular disease is the most frequent cause ( 36% ) of mortality in patients with adpkd . 
 patients with adpkd often develop hypertension at an earlier age than the general population before any impairment of kidney function . 
 it is hypothesized that the renin - aldosterone system and endothelial dysfunction caused by impaired nitric oxide release are the important factors in the development of hypertension in adpkd patients . 
 we describe an uncommon case of a middle - aged man with a spontaneous coronary artery dissection ( cad ) and adpkd . 
 a 41-year - old caucasian man presented at an emergency department with acute chest pain . the chest pain began 2 h before presentation . 
 medical history recorded a subdural haematoma  as a result of trauma . according to the family history  
 our patient was a non - smoker  with no history of hypertension  diabetes mellitus or hypercholesterolaemia . on physical examination  the blood pressure was 155/102 mmhg and the pulse 72 beats / minute ; other vital parameters were normal . 
 electrocardiography showed a sinus rhythm of 65 beats / minute and st elevation in the precordial leads ( figure 1 ) . 
 / l  creatine kinase mb was 17.4 u / l and troponin t was 0.21 ng / ml . the other laboratory test results were normal . 
 echocardiography revealed a hypokinetic septum and a slightly impaired left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 4560% . 
 electrocardiography on presentation shows a sinus rhythm of 65 beats / minute and st elevation in v3  ii and iii . 
 based on these results  a presumptive diagnosis of acute septal myocardial infarction was made . 
 coronary artery angiography ( cag ) revealed a transient occlusion of the left anterior descending ( lad ) coronary artery  most probably as a result of myocardial bridging ( figure 2a ) . 
 the cag ( a ) shows the compression of the lad coronary artery during the systole resulting in narrowing and ( b ) performed after the second chest pain attack demonstrating a dissection in the distal left anterior descending coronary artery . however  the chest pain returned 3 days after the presentation . 
 a second electrocardiography showed persistent inverted t waves in the precordial leads without st elevation . 
 it disclosed an open lad with a dissection in the distal part and a double lumen  which was not observed during the first angiography ( figure 2b ) . 
 the definitive diagnosis of non - q - wave anterior infarct as a result of a spontaneous lad dissection was made . 
 based on the cysts in both kidneys combined with a family history of adpkd  the diagnosis of adpkd was made ( ravine s criteria ) . since cerebral aneurysms are one of the extrarenal manifestations of adpkd  a computerized tomography angiography of the brain was performed  with a negative result for vascular anomalies . an exercise stress test  performed 16 days after the onset of chest pain  was normal . 
 the lad was patent without a significant infarction  but still with a double lumen appearance . at 2-year follow - up by a nephrologist  
 our patient  a relatively young man with a negative cardiovascular profile and a history of subdural haematoma  developed a myocardial infarction secondary to dissection of the lad . 
 the cad was not recognized during the first cag because the relevant coronary artery can obturate the dissection in the acute phase . 
 this condition is found when the segmental coronary artery has an intramyocardial course  being compressed during systole and restored during diastole . 
 therefore  one would require a difference in coronary artery contraction in the systolic and diastolic phase which was not observed on the first cag . 
 four cases were reported on the occurrence of a spontaneous cad in middle - aged adpkd patients . 
 predisposing factors for cad in adpkd patients are still undetermined  especially in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors . 
 furthermore  it is not known if arterial dissection is an extrarenal manifestation of adpkd or if is just secondary to hypertension . 
 the estimated prevalence of spontaneous cad is 0.7%  and it is in 2% of cases  the cause of acute coronary syndrome . the lad is affected in 80% of the patients with cad [ 8  9 ] . 
 the majority of patients with a cad often lack classical risk factors for cardiovascular disease and are female . 
 de maio et al .   identified three groups of patients with cad : ( i ) patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  ( ii ) women in the postpartum period and ( iii ) an idiopathic group . 
 several underlying conditions in the idiopathic group are suggested  such as polyarteritis nodosa  lupus erythematosus  marfan s syndrome  ehlers  danlos syndrome  intense physical exercise  the use of cocaine  cyclosporin and oral contraceptives . 
 the tunica media  the middle layer of elastic arteries  include smooth muscles with interposing layers of elastic lamellae . 
 the connection between the intracellular contractile filaments and extracellular elastic fibres is provided by dense plaque sites . 
 localization in the dense plaques assigns a significant function to polycystins in maintaining vascular integrity . 
 furthermore  qian et al .   suggested that abnormal intracellular calcium concentration in the vascular smooth muscle cells is linked to vascular phenotype in the case of inactivation of polycystin-2 protein . 
 literature also confirms the observation of intracranial aneurysms and myocardial infarction secondary to coronary aneurysms in certain families and the occurrence of vascular rupture and haemorrhage in homozygous polycystic kidney disease ( pkd)-1 knockout mice [ 4  11 ] . considering these results  and the high plasma renin activity and impaired nitric oxide release in adpkd patients  
 we speculate that the vascular abnormalities are most likely a direct result of pkd mutations rather than a secondary cause of hypertension . in conclusion  polycystins seem to play a main role in the stability of the arterial vasculature . therefore  a spontaneous cad should be considered as an extrarenal manifestation of adpkd . 
 the clinician should be aware of cad if adpkd patients present with chest pain or discomfort . 
 cag can be inconclusive in respect to the mechanism of coronary occlusion in the acute phase and should be repeated  especially when the complaints persist .","

1) Abstract: This case report highlights the possible association between ADPKD and CAD, suggesting a genetic link as the main cause for unstable artery vasculature. It also emphasizes the importance of additional investigation in patients with ADPKD presenting with acute chest pain to avoid missing a potentially fatal condition such as CAD.
2) Research and Discussion: Limited research has been done on the link between ADPKD and CAD, but this case shows that CAD can be missed in the acute phase and should be considered in patients with ADPKD. The genetic disorder in ADPKD may lead to abnormalities in the arterial wall, making it more susceptible to dissection.
3) Results and Conclusion: The patient in this case developed a spontaneous dissection of the left anterior descending coronary artery, leading to a myocardial infarction. ADPKD was later diagnosed during additional investigation. This highlights the need for increased awareness and further investigation in patients with ADPKD presenting with acute chest pain to prevent missed diagnoses and potential complications. Medical management was successful in this case, but prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial for better outcomes."
"optimal treatment of cancers in children often requires combined - modality therapy  including : chemotherapy  surgery  and/or radiotherapy . 
 chemotherapy is not always sufficient to achieve the cure of solid tumors in children ; either resection or radiation may be needed for local tumor control as well ( 1 ) . 
 children with radiosensitive malignant tumors typically require radiation therapy for a number of sessions over a period of several weeks . 
 although the procedure is painless  young children need to be sedated or anesthetised in order to provide a motionless state during the procedure . a short period of sedation  analgesia or general anaesthesia 
 the patient and anaesthesia equipment are observed continuously by closed - circuit television  and monitors are mirrored to the remote observation site outside the treatment room . 
 different anesthesia methods and anesthetics have been recommended to provide a safe and optimal situation of motionless with a short recovery period in children undergoing general anaesthesia or sedation for external beam irradiation ( 37 ) . 
 this report describes the accidental detection of a missed complication by the anesthetist at the time of radiotherapy  from the previous chemotherapy  which was preliminarily and unduly attributed to anesthesia . 
 a 2.5 year - old  13-kg boy  asa ( american society of anesthesiologists ) class ii  with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( all )  was scheduled for radiotherapy . 
 anesthesia was planned by the anesthetist  and the physical examination was normal before radiotherapy . 
 routine monitoring was established  and for peripheral pulse monitoring  the distal portion of the right upper limb of the child was rested out of the covers . 
 after about 5 minutes  when the anesthetic effect of ketamine began  we noticed a lack of right radial pulse . 
 anesthesia - related hemodynamic instability was expected  however no other manifestation of hypoxia or hypo - perfusion was detected . 
 furthermore  carotid pulsation was normal  and examination of the left radial pulse and other peripheral pulses showed normal pulsation . 
 the patient showed a scar and swelling on the right antecubital area . a more detailed history taken from the child s parents showed his history of chemotherapy 
 during which extravasation of the chemotherapy drug had resulted in severe inflammation and edema at the site of injection . 
 a colour doppler ultrasound of the antecubital area showed deep edema and chronic compression on the antecubital tissue and confirmed the diagnosis . 
 permission was obtained from the patient s parents to use the patient s reports  however the patient s information was to remain confidential . 
 the incidence range of extravasations of cytostatic drugs in cancer patients has been reported from 0.2 to 1.4% in a five - year study ( 8) . 
 extravasations in cytostatic treatment may cause a wide range of symptoms  from patients discomfort to severe complications such as necrosis and amputation . 
 ( 9 ) eccrine squamous syringometaplasia  while rare  has also occurred in patients who have received chemotherapy treatment ( 10 ) . 
 yeung et al described a case of metastatic ovarian carcinoma with repeated thrombosis of the femoral arteries following intravenous carboplatin - based combination chemotherapy . 
 persistent withdrawal occlusion ( pwo ) is frequently caused by fibrin sheath formation around venous access devices . 
 small doses of thrombolytic drugs ( such as urokinase ) could manage pwo  but could also serious complicate chemotherapy drug extravasation ( 12 ) . 
 keratolytic ointment was applied for old lesions  whereas in new lesions  multiple subcutaneous injections of hydrocortisone solution were used before the application of betamethasone ointment . 
 application of conservative agents in radiotherapy - induced extravasation areas may avoid tissue necrosis and consequently  reconstructive surgery ( 13 ) . 
 management of cytotoxic drug extravasation in humans is based on the experimental evidences and available case reports because of lack of randomized trials . 
 for instance  topical dimethylsulfoxide ( dmso ) and cooling for extravasation of anthracyclines or mitomycin  local injection of hyaluronidase for extravasation of vinca alkaloids  and local injection of sodium thiosulfate ( sodium hyposulfite ) for extravasation of chlormethine ( mechlorethamine ; mustine ) should be empirically recommended . in the case of failed conservative treatment  
 history and physical examination before injection of anesthetic agents could be useful in preventing patient mismanagement . 
 a weak pulse in a child can be a significant problem for the anesthesiologist and in this case  it was shown to be a critically misleading factor . 
 increased emphasis is on clinical evaluation and pulse checking is necessary  especially in children with a history of chemotherapy . providing thorough pulse evaluation when we work on children and avoiding immediate aggressive intervention before being certain about the cause of weak pulse are additional issues of importance shown by this case report .",".

1) Abstract: This report discusses a case where a pediatric cancer patient undergoing radiotherapy experienced a complication of a pulseless radial artery. The cause was initially attributed to anesthesia, but was later found to be due to extravasation of chemotherapeutic agent during a previous treatment. This emphasizes the importance of proper intravenous cannula establishment and thorough patient evaluation before administering anesthesia or sedation in children with cancer.

2) Research and Discussion: Cancer treatment in children often involves a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and/or radiotherapy. While these procedures are not inherently painful, children require anesthesia or sedation to remain still. Complications, such as the pulseless radial artery seen in this case, can arise from the procedures themselves or from previous treatments. Accurate assessment and cannula establishment before administering anesthesia can help prevent potential mismanagement in pediatric cancer procedures.

3) Results and Conclusion: Proper intravenous cannula establishment before chemotherapy and careful evaluation before inducing anesthesia or sedation are crucial in preventing complications in pediatric cancer patients. This case highlights the importance of thorough patient assessment and history to avoid misdiagnosis and ensure safe and effective treatment. By following these steps, healthcare providers can help provide optimal care for children with cancer undergoing treatment. "
"annually  more than 2.5 million muslims from about 140 countries go on the hajj pilgrimage  which is the largest mass gathering in the world . 
 the presence of such a vast number of people in the holy places  especially in the cities of mecca and medina  and the massive pilgrim crowds in certain places at certain times  causes infectious diseases to spread more easily . 
 racial  cultural and health differences  as well as the level of access to health  medical and welfare services at the time of stay in these places are important factors that increase the risk of communicable diseases 
 . both  viral or bacterial respiratory tract infections are very common among pilgrims in all age and sex groups  and is regarded as the most common disease among pilgrims in some reports . 
 some studies have also reported the prevalence of different types of these infections up to 85.3% . to prevent these infections  
 some preventive measures have been recommended for the pilgrims  such as mandatory injection of tetravalent meningococcal meningitis vaccine  recommendation to inject seasonal flu vaccine  and using surgical masks . on the other hand  
 each country plans and implements some specific measures to prevent and control these diseases among pilgrims . 
 more than 100000 iranians in about 600 caravans undertook the hajj in 2010 . according to the current policies of the hajj medical center of iran  before traveling any caravan 
 common diseases detected among pilgrims are treated in the caravan itself  or referred to the medical center  if needed . 
 the reports show conflicting results about the effects of preventive measures for respiratory tract infections and in fact  a precise study on the effects of each one of these preventive measures has been rarely done . 
 this research is trying to examine the effects of general preventive measures on respiratory tract infections through a nested case - control study  which is more precise design than ordinary case - control studies . 
 we used nested case - control design  which is based on risk set sampling . 
 the studied cohort consist two caravans ( 338 pilgrims )  one of which was the first to enter mecca  and the other the first to enter medina . 
 the outcome of this study was all types of respiratory tract infections other than the common cold including tonsillitis  pharyngitis  laryngitis  sinusitis  otitis media  bronchitis  pneumonia and influenza . 
 as soon as any patient in the caravans was identified  a data collection form was completed for that individual . 
 considering that the level of presence in saudi arabia and the amount of contact with all types of viruses and bacteria are regarded as risk  on the day of identifying each patient  two pilgrims in the same caravan were randomly selected as control group . 
 each control pilgrim was not affected by the mentioned outcome at the time of investigation  although these pilgrims may be enrolled as a case in future days . 
 every pilgrim who become ill with studied disease and had consent to participate  was enrolled in the study . 
 all pilgrims who did not get the studied disease at time of selection and had consent to participate  could be enrolled as controls . 
 body mass index ( bmi ) is calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms to height square in meter . if another patient with studied disease existed in the same room then the pilgrim considered as having  room contacty  . 
 if the pilgrims used face masks in crowding  even occasionally were considered as  using face mask  . 
 pilgrims considered as vaccinated against influenza if they vaccinated by this vaccine since two years before traveling to saudi arabia . 
 pilgrims  who washed their mouth and throat with salt water at least once a day  were considered as having  salt water gargling  . 
 pilgrims with a past history of at least one systemic diseases including asthma  diabetes mellitus  hypertension  copd and cardiovascular diseases were considered as having  systemic diseases  . present or past smoker with any type and amount of smoking were considered as smokers . 
 if the pilgrims used personal prayer carpet in holy places were considered as  using personal prayer carpet  . 
 the effect of each preventive measure on the occurrence of respiratory tract infections was studied through a univariable model . at the next stage  all variables which were significant in the first stage ( p < 0.2 )  were entered into the multiple models  and the adjusted odds ratio was obtained for each one of the variables . 
 we used nested case - control design  which is based on risk set sampling . 
 the studied cohort consist two caravans ( 338 pilgrims )  one of which was the first to enter mecca  and the other the first to enter medina . 
 the outcome of this study was all types of respiratory tract infections other than the common cold including tonsillitis  pharyngitis  laryngitis  sinusitis  otitis media  bronchitis  pneumonia and influenza . 
 as soon as any patient in the caravans was identified  a data collection form was completed for that individual . 
 considering that the level of presence in saudi arabia and the amount of contact with all types of viruses and bacteria are regarded as risk  on the day of identifying each patient  two pilgrims in the same caravan were randomly selected as control group .

 pilgrims  who washed their mouth and throat with salt water at least once a day  were considered as having  salt water gargling  . 
 pilgrims with a past history of at least one systemic diseases including asthma  diabetes mellitus  hypertension  copd and cardiovascular diseases were considered as having  systemic diseases  . present or past smoker with any type and amount of smoking were considered as smokers . 
 if the pilgrims used personal prayer carpet in holy places were considered as  using personal prayer carpet  . 
 the effect of each preventive measure on the occurrence of respiratory tract infections was studied through a univariable model . at the next stage  all variables which were significant in the first stage ( p < 0.2 )  were entered into the multiple models  and the adjusted odds ratio was obtained for each one of the variables . 
 during the hajj pilgrimage  32 people ( 9.5% ) of the cohort ( 338 pilgrims ) were affected by respiratory tract infections . according to the explained method 
 description of cases and controls  in terms of age  sex  education and other factors which influence the incidence of respiratory tract infections  are presented in table 1 . 
 distribution of factors affecting respiratory tract infections in hajj pilgrims  2010 sixty nine percent of the patients were treated with symptomatic treatment and oral antibiotics  and 27.5% required treatment through intravenous antibiotics as well . 
 in addition  79.3% of the patients fully recovered through the treatment administered in the caravan  but 17.2% were referred to the hajj medical center  and finally 3.4% of the total patients were hospitalized in that center . 
 univariable logistic regression analysis showed that among the variables studied  only gargling with salt water  presence of other patients in the room  age and level of education  have p < 0.2 and can be associated with respiratory tract infections . among these variables  
 gargling with salt water with or = 2.4 and p = 0.08 had the strongest relationship [ table 2 ] . 
 the role of protective measures and other individual factors on respiratory tract infections among hajj pilgrims  2010 the multivariable logistic regression model showed that none of the factors listed above were significantly associated with the outcome being studied . 
 for example  presence of the other patient in the room increases the risk of outcome by 2.67 times  but this effect is not significant  according to the confidence intervals of or [ table 2 ] . 
 the results also showed that the current preventive measures including wearing face masks  seasonal flu vaccination  and use of personal prayer carpet were not effective enough in the prevention of these infections . 
 however  the seasonal flu vaccination has been recommended  especially in high - risk individuals or those over 65 years of age . 
 the influenza vaccine has been proved by other researchers to have no effect in the prevention of respiratory infections  and it has even been seen that the use of seasonal influenza vaccine prolongs the period of sore throat . 
 however  methodological problems of the studies and the applied methods  including laboratory or demographic studies  should be considered when comparing these results . 
 it should also be noted that recommendations to take a seasonal influenza vaccine is due to its preventive effect on the incidence of flu and reduction of the risk of pandemic swine flu . 
 other studies  like the results of this study  have shown that wearing face masks has no effect on respiratory infections . 
 although the cdc does not recommend wearing it  the saudi ministry of health recommends that pilgrims wear face masks . 
 the recommendation to wear masks is probably because of its role in the prevention of tuberculosis  which has not been studied among the pilgrims . 
 the effect of using a personal prayer carpet has not been studied in other reports . 
 probably  the close contact of the pilgrims with each other  and their presence in crowded places are the main causes for transmission of respiratory infections  so it hinders a possible protective role played by the personal prayer carpet . 
 although  the effect of this action on the prevention of respiratory infections was not significant in the multiple logistic model  it seems that the reason for it is the relatively small sample size in the study . 
 in other words  through studies with a larger sample size  it may be concluded that lack of gargling with salt water increases the risk of respiratory infections by 2.3 times . 
 similarly  it can be said that staying with other patients in the same room increases the risk of respiratory infections by 2.67 times . as can be seen in table 2  factors such as age  sex  level of education  area of the room  smoking  systemic diseases  obesity  and the average daily hours of gathering together in the holy places have no effect on respiratory tract infections . 
 in other words  any age and sex group with different individual conditions is likely to get exposed to viral and bacterial causes of these infections . as mentioned above  the relatively small sample size is one of the limitations of this study . 
 an increase in the sample size would make it possible to study the role of factors associated with respiratory infections in any of the holy places ( mecca  medina  mina  etc . ) . in this study  
 the cases were of those who were diagnosed clinically by a caravan physician . if the rapid test diagnosis is applied along with the acceptable sensitivity and specificity to diagnose cases  the accuracy of the study will increase . 
 flu vaccinations wearing face masks  personal prayer carpet  smoking  obesity  etc .  do not affect the incidence of respiratory infections during the hajj  and if this study is to be undertaken with a larger sample size  according to the appropriate selected methodology  some evidence will be obtained showing the prophylactic effect of gargling with salt water in the prevention of these infections .","

1) Abstract: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of preventive measures on respiratory tract infections, specifically during the hajj pilgrimage. The results show that measures such as influenza vaccination and face masks had no significant impact, but salt water gargling appeared to be the most effective method.

2) Research and Discussion: A nested case-control design was used to study a cohort of 338 Iranian pilgrims. Data was collected upon the occurrence of any respiratory tract infection, and control groups were randomly selected. The findings suggest that factors like age and education level had no significant effect on the incidence of respiratory tract infections, while salt water gargling showed potential as an effective preventive measure.

3) Results and Conclusion: Of the 338 pilgrims, 32 (9.5%) were affected by respiratory tract infections other than common colds. Univariable analysis showed some potential associations, but multivariable analysis showed no significant results for any of the preventive measures except for salt water gargling. Thus, it can be concluded that this measure may be the most effective in preventing respiratory tract infections during the hajj pilgrimage."
"care coordination is an important aspect of nursing care especially for elderly patients admitted to an acute care setting . in singapore care coordination and transitional care nursing is a new concept of care nevertheless important but unexplored .

"the irrevocable aim of endodontics is a three - dimensional unblemished seal of the root canal system which is achieved by perfect designing of the canal diameter and canal form . 
 the biomechanical preparation is one of the major steps for removal of bacteria and debris in the root canal so as to achieve a successful endodontic treatment . during root canal instrumentation 
 there are complications such as perforations  ledge formation  transportation of canal  and formation of cracks in the root dentin . at times  in the zeal of biomechanical preparation of the canal we inevitably end up damaging the root dentin  which becomes a gateway to dentinal cracks and minute intricate fractures ; thereby  causing failure of treatment . as a result of craze lines or microcracks  there might be occurrence of root fracture that propagates due to repeated application of stress by the occlusal forces . 
 shemesh et al .  observed more dentinal defects in teeth which were obturated with spreader than teeth obturated without spreader . in different degrees 
  dentinal damage can occur due to procedures like biomechanical preparation  obturation  and retreatment . 
 complexities in the preparation of root canal may be attributed to variation in the design of the cutting instrument  taper  or composition of the material from which it is made . 
 hand instrumentation  the milestone of endodontic practice in the past  though have lost popularity  still remain the integral part of canal preparation . 
 rotary instrument by its innate behavior in the canal may result in more friction  which may increase dentinal defects and microcracks formation in comparison to hand instruments . 
 possible relationship between the design of niti rotary instruments and the incidence of the vertical root fractures was found by kim et al .  and it was concluded that the design of the file affects strain concentration and the apical stress during instrumentation of root canal . 
 recently  the protaper next ( ptn  dentsply  maillefer ) files were introduced in the family of niti rotary instruments with a completely new design comprising of unique swaggering movement  greater flexibility  the m - wire technology  the 5 generation of continuous improvement  and its offset design . 
 whether it is rotary or hand files ( hfs )  they are assumed to cause limited frictional forces within the canal  hence creating dentinal defects . 
 so there is need to study the behavior of different niti rotary instruments and the newly developed rotary system  ptn  on root dentin . 
 teeth with curved roots  calcified canals  extracanals  and teeth with developmental anomaly or resorption were excluded from the study . 
 the teeth were decoronated at coronal portions by using a diamond disc  leaving roots approximately of 10 mm in length . 
 all the roots were inspected with transmitted light for detecting any preexisting cracks or any craze - lines by using a stereomicroscope under 12  to exclude teeth with such findings from this study . 
 patency of the canal was established using a # 10 k - file ( mani  japan ) in the canal . 
 the specimens were then divided into four groups ; each group containing 15 specimens each . 
 hfs upto file # 40 were used for canal preparation . in the pt ( dentsply  maillefer )  hs ( micro - mega  besancon  france )  and ptn ( dentsply  maillefer ) groups ; preparation of the canals was done using speed and torque controlled motor ( x - smart ; dentsply  maillefer ) . in the hand files group  
 step - back technique was used upto file # 40 . in the pt group  
 the following sequence of pt rotary niti files were used for preparation of canals at 300 rpm : the shaping file x for coronal enlargement  and s1  s2  f1  f2  and f3 files  corresponding to apical size 30  used at the working length . in the hs group 
  the hs niti files were used upto file # 30 at 300 rpm in crown - down sequence . in ptn group  
 the ptn rotary system files were used at 300 rpm in the following sequence : x1  x2 and x3  corresponding to apical size # 30 . 
 the ptn rotary files were used in a constant rotation at a speed of 300 rpm with light apical pressure ( recommended torque is 2.0 ncm  adjustable up to 5.2 ncm according to practitioner experience ) . 
 flutes of the instruments were cleaned frequently to check any signs of distortion or wear . 
 the ptn instruments are recommended to be used mechanically ( manually in very severe curvatures ) in a clockwise continuous motion with a brushing motion  away from external root concavities  to facilitate flute unloading and apical file progression . in all the experimental groups  
 sectioning of all the roots was done perpendicular to the long axis at 9  6  and 3 mm using a diamond disc under water cooling . 
 digital images of each sectioned root was captured using a 40 stereomicroscope by using a digital camera ( olympus  tokyo  japan ) . 
 roots were classified as  no defect    fracture   and  other defects  as described in table 1 . classification for identification of defects in the specimens the results were expressed as the number and percentage of defects in each group . 
 chi - square test was used for the statistical analysis of the groups . the level of significance was set at p = 0.05 using statistical package for social sciences ( spss ) 20.0 .

 in the present study ; in hfs  pt  hs  and ptn  the number and incidence of defects observed in the root dentin was found to be 1/15 ( 6.67% )  6/15 ( 40% )  10/15 ( 66.67% )  and 4/15 ( 26.7% )  respectively . 
 group i ( hfs ) showed the lowest incidence of defects ( 6.67% ) ; whereas  hs group showed the maximum incidence of defects ( 66.67% ) as compared to other groups . 
 the results of our study are in accordance with imam  who reported lowest number of defects ( 1/20 ) by hfs ; and yold as et al .  observed highest incidence of defects ( 12/20 ) by hss rotary files . 
  in the present study the number and percentage of defects shown by the ptn rotary files were 4/15  that is  26.7% . 
 the results of the present study are not in accordance with the results by bier et al . 
  where the hfs showed no defect and pt rotary files showed highest incidence of dentinal damage ( 16% ) . 
 excess removal of root dentin during root canal preparation and obturation of the canal with spreader may create fracture in the teeth . 
 the important goal in endodontics is resistance to tooth fracture because such fractures might cause decrease in the long - term survival rate . in the presents 
 the number of rotations required for complete root canal preparation is more with niti rotary instruments than with the hfs . 
 kim et al .  stated that taper of the files is the responsible for increase of stress on the walls of the root canal ; whereas  bier et al .  stated taper of the files as one of the contributing factor for crack formation in root dentin . 
 pt have more taper ( 0.07  0.08  and 0.09  respectively ) than the hss ( 0.04 and 0.06 ) and the ptn ( x1  x2  and x3 ; 0.04  0.06  and 0.07  respectively ) . 
 this explains that there can be formation of cracks in the pt group  as reported earlier by bier et al . 
  liu et al .  barreto et al .  and liu et al . 
 furthermore  relatively low flexibility of the hs may have contributed to the maximum number of defects in hs group in the present study . 
 rotational force is applied to the canals of the root by niti rotary instruments  thus creating craze line or microcracks in root dentin . 
 formation of such defects may be associated with the design of tip  cross - sectional geometry  taper type ( constant or progressive )  flute form  and pitch ( constant or variable ) . 
 the pt files have a triangular cross - sectional geometry  hs having a triple helix cross - sectional geometry ; whereas  the ptn is rectangular . 
 thus  it can be stated that design of the rotary files is not the only factor for defect formation in root dentin . 
 lam et al .  stated that forces shaping the root dentin can be affected by the file design . 
 risk of root fracture is increased due to the forces generated during the root canal preparation . 
 ptn files have m - wire technology with off - centered rectangular cross - section  giving the file a snake - like swaggering movement as it moves along the root canal  thus reducing the screw effect  the unwanted taper lock  and torque on any of the given file ; thus decreasing the file - root dentin contact . 
 m - wire alloy niti material with controlled memory niti wire are flexible than those made from conventional niti wire . 
 thus  such flexibility of ptn rotary files may have contributed in less number of dentinal defects formation as compared to pt and hs . 
 capar et al .  concluded that the swaggering motion and less taper of the ptn instruments could change the root canal volume to an extent as that of the higher tapered instruments . 
 use of different speed and torque settings for each rotary system could be the limitation of our study . 
 increase in the rotational speed is associated with increased cutting efficiency.simulation of periodontal ligament was not done in the present study .

Abstract: The study aimed to assess dentinal defects caused by the new rotary system ProTaper Next (PTN). 60 single-rooted premolars were divided into four groups and prepared using different instruments. Defects were evaluated using a stereomicroscope. Results showed the lowest percentage of defects in roots prepared with hand files, while all rotary files induced defects.

Research and Discussion: A total of 60 single-rooted premolars were prepared using hand files (HFS), ProTaper Universal (PT), Hero Shaper (HS), and ProTaper Next (PTN). Defects were evaluated in three sections and analyzed using a stereomicroscope. Results showed the lowest percentage of defects in HFS group, while significant difference was found between HS and PTN groups.

Results and Conclusion: Analysis of dentinal defects in roots prepared with different instruments showed lowest percentage in HFS group (6.7%), while PTN group had 26.7% defects. Significant difference was found between HS and PTN groups (p<0.05). It can be concluded that all rotary files induced defects in root dentin, with minimal defects caused by hand instruments."
"batch processes are used in production of many low - volume but high - value - added products ( such as speciality chemicals  health care  food  agrochemicals  etc . ) because of operation flexibility in today 's market - driven environment . 
 in addition  if two or more products require similar processing steps  the same set of equipment is considered for at least economical reason . 
 a batch plant producing multiple products is categorized as either a multiproduct plant or a multipurpose plant . 
 in such a plant  all the products follow the same path through the process and only one product is manufactured at a time . 
 processing of other products is carried out using the same equipment in successive production runs or campaigns . in a multipurpose plant  
 each product follows one or more distinct processing paths ; so more than one product may be produced simultaneously in such plants . 
 the present work is directed toward the optimal design problems of multiproduct batch plants . in conventional optimal design of a multiproduct plant  
 production requirements of each product and a total production time for all products are available and specified . 
 the number  the required volume  and size of parallel equipment units in each stage are then determined to minimize the investment . 
 it should be emphasized that batch plantsdesign has been for long identified as a key problem in chemical engineering as   reported in literature   [ 29 ] . 
 formulation of batch plant design generally involves mathematical programming methods  such as linear programming ( lp )  nonlinear programming ( nlp )  mixed - integer linear programming ( milp ) or mixed - integer nonlinear programming ( minlp ) . mathematical programming or different optimization techniques  such as branch and bound  heuristics  genetic algorithm  simulated annealing  
 are thoroughly used to derive optimal solutions . however  in reality the multiproduct design problem can be formulated as a multiobjective design optimization problem in which one seeks to minimize investment  operation cost  and total production time  and  simultaneously  to maximize the revenue . recall that not much work has been reported in the literature on the multiobjective optimal design of a multiproduct batch plant . 
 huang and wang   introduced a fuzzy decision - making approach for multiobjective optimal design problem of a multiproduct batch plant . a monotonic increasing or decreasing membership function is used to define the degree of satisfaction for each objective function and the problem is then represented as an augmented minmax problem formulated as minlp models . to obtain a unique solution  
 presented the development of a two - stage methodology for multiobjective batch plant design and retrofit according to multiple criteria . 
 the authors used a multiobjective genetic algorithm based on the combination of a single - objective genetic algorithm and a pareto sort procedure for proposing several plant structures and a discrete event simulator for evaluating the technical feasibility of the proposed configurations . in the case of multiple objectives  an optimum solution with respect to all objectives may not exist . in most cases  
 the objective functions are in conflict  because in order to decrease any of the objective functions  we need to increase other objective functions . 
 recently  solimanpur et al .   developed a sophisticated multiobjective integer programming model where the objectives considered were the maximization of total similarity between parts  the minimization of the total processing cost  the minimization of the total processing time and the minimization of the total investment needed for the acquisition of machines . 
 the presence of multiple objectives in a problem usually gives rise to a family of nondominated solutions  largely known as pareto - optimal   solutions  where each objective component of any solution along the pareto front can only be improved by degrading at least one of its other objective components . 
 since none of the solutions in the nondominated set is absolutely better than any other  any one of them is then an acceptable solution . as it is difficult to choose any particular solution for a multiobjective optimization problem without iterative interaction with the decision maker ( dm )   one general approach is to establish first the entire set of pareto - optimal solutions  where an external decision maker ( dm ) direct intervention gives interactive information in the multiobjective optimization loop . 
 so  a satisfactory solution of the problem is found as soon as the knowledge is acquired . 
 promethee ii ( preference ranking organisation method for enrichment evaluations2nd version ) is a popular decision method that has been successfully applied in the selection of the final solution of multiobjective optimization problems . 
 it generates a ranking of available points  according to the dm preferences  and the best ranked one is considered the favourite final solution . 
 it is based on the concept of outranking relation  which is a binary relation defined between every pair ( a  b ) of alternatives  in such way that  if a is preferred to b ( according to the dm interests )  then it is said that a outranks b. when these relations are defined between all pairs of alternatives  they are exploited according to some rules in order to rank all solutions from the   best to the worst . 
 this is a nonpareto based approach based on the selection of several relevant groups of individuals  each group being associated to a given objective . 
 it is reported that the method tends to crowd results at extremes of the solution space  often yielding to poor convergence of the pareto front . a more recent algorithm  based on scalarization with a weighted sum function  
 many successful evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms were developed based on the two ideas suggested by goldberg : pareto dominance and niching . 
 pareto dominance is used to exploit the search space in the direction of the pareto front and niching technique explores the search space along the front to keep diversity . the well - known algorithms in this category include multiobjective genetic algorithm : ( moga )  niched pareto genetic algorithm : ( npga )  strength pareto evolutionary algorithm : ( spea )  multiobjective evolutionary algorithm : ( moea )  the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm ( nsga ) proposed by srinivas and deb   was one of the first evolutionary algorithm for solving multiobjective optimization problems . 
 although nsga has been successfully applied  the main criticisms of this approach has been its high computational complexity of nondominated sorting  lack of elitism  and need for specifying a tuneable parameter called sharing parameter . 
 recently  deb et al .   reported an improved version of nsga  which they called nsga - ii  to address all the above issues . 
 the purpose of this study is to extend this methodology for solution of multiobjective optimal control problems under the framework of nsga - ii . 
 the problem of multiproduct batch plant covered in this paper can be defined by assuming that the plant consists of a sequence of m batch processing stages that are used to manufacture n different products . at each stage j 
 there are nj   identical units in parallel operating out of phase  each with a size vj . 
 batches are transferred from one stage to the next without any delay  that is  we consider a      zero - wait operating policy .   in the conventional design of a multiproduct batch plant  
 one seeks to minimize the investment cost by determining the optimal number  required volume and size of parallel equipment units in each stage for a specified production requirement of each product and the total production time . 
 however  in reality the designer considers not only minimizing the investment but also minimizing the operation cost and total production time while maximizing the revenue  simultaneously 
				 ( 1)maxnj  vj  bi  tli  qi  h  revenue = f1=i=1ncpiqi  
 ( 2)minnj  vj  bi  tli  qi  hinvestment cost = f2=j=1mnjjvjbj  
 ( 3)minnj  vj  bi  tli  qi  h  operation cost = f3=i=1n  j=1mcejqjbi+coiqi  
 ( 4)minnj  vj  bi  tli  qi  h  total  production  time = f4=h . 
 so  the multiobjective problem consists of determining the following parameters :   nj   the number of parallel units in stage j  vj   the required volume of a unit in stage j  bi   size of the batch of product i at the end of the m stages  tli the cycle time for product i    qi the production requirement of product i and  h   the total production time  while satisfying certain constraints such as volume  time  and so forth . 
 volume vj has to be able to process all the products i : ( 2 ) time constraint . 
 the summation of available production time for all products is not more than the net total time for production 
			
				 ( 6)i=1nqibitlih . 
 ( 3 )   the limiting cycle time for product i : 
			
				 ( 7)ijnjtli   i=1  n ;  j=1  m . 
 every unit has restricted allowable range 
			
				 ( 8)vjlvjvju   j=1  m  bjlbjbju   j=1  n . 
 in contrast to the simple genetic algorithms that look for the unique solution  the multiobjective genetic algorithm tries to find as many elements of the pareto set as possible . for the case of the nsga - ii  this one is provided with operators who allow it to know the level of nondominance of every solution as well as the grade of closeness with other solutions ; which allows it to explore widely inside the feasible region . in a brief form 
  the functioning of the multiobjective genetic algorithm nsga - ii can be described through the following steps . 
 fast nondominated sorta very efficient procedure  is used to arrange the solutions in fronts ( nondominated arranging )  in accordance with their aptitude values . 
 a domination count np    the number of solutions which dominates the solution p  and a set ( sp )  that contains the solutions that are dominated for p. the solutions of the first front have the higher status of nondominance in the pareto sense . a very efficient procedure  
 is used to arrange the solutions in fronts ( nondominated arranging )  in accordance with their aptitude values . 
 a domination count np    the number of solutions which dominates the solution p  and a set ( sp )  that contains the solutions that are dominated for p. the solutions of the first front have the higher status of nondominance in the pareto sense . 
 diversity preservationthis is achieved  by means of the calculation of the crowding degree or closeness for each of the solutions inside the population . 
 this quantity is obtained  by calculating the average distance of two points on either side of a particular solution along each of the objectives . 
 this quantity serves as an estimate of the cuboid perimeter  formed by using the nearest neighbours as the vertices . 
 there is also  an operator called crowded - comparison ( n )  which guides to the genetic algorithm  towards the pareto optimal front  in accordance with the following criterion : 
			
					 ( 9)in  j  if  ( irank < jrank)or  ( irank = jrank )  and  ( ididtance > jdistance ) . 
						 in accordance with the previous criterion  between two nondominated solutions  we prefer the solution with the better rank . 
 otherwise  if both solutions belong to the same front  then  we prefer the solution that is located in a lesser crowded region .

 initial loopinitially  a random parent population ( po ) of size n is created . 
 then the usual binary tournament selection  recombination and mutation operators are used to create a new population ( q0 )  of size n. initially  a random parent population ( po ) of size n is created . 
 then the usual binary tournament selection  recombination and mutation operators are used to create a new population ( q0 )  of size n. main loopthe nsga - ii procedure can be explained  by describing the th   generation just as it is showed in figure 1 . 
 the procedure begins with the combination of pt and qt forming a new population called rt  then the population rt is sorted using the nondomination criterion . since all previous and current population members are included in rt  
 the population rt has a size of 2n  later  the different fronts of nondominated solutions are created  being f1 the front that contains the better rank solutions . 
 figure 4 shows that  during the process of forming the new population pt+1  the algorithm takes all members of the fronts f1 and f2  and some elements of the front f3 ; this is  because n solutions are needed exactly for the new population pt+1 to find them exactly n solutions  the last front is ordained  which for this description is the number 3  arranging the solutions in descending order by means of the crowded comparison ( n )  and selecting the best solutions needed to fill all population slots . after having the population pt+1  the genetic operators of selection  crossing and mutation  are used to create the new population qt+1 of size n. finally it is mentioned that the selection process  the crowded comparison operator is used .

 to demonstrate the effectiveness of nsga - ii on batch plant processes two examples are given here . 
 the first example is about a batch plant consisting of three processing stages ( mixer  reactor  and centrifuge ) to manufacture two products  a and b. the second example treats four processing stages ( mixer  reactor  extraction and centrifuge ) to manufacture three products a  b and c. the data for examples    1 and   2 are illustrated  respectively  in tables 1 and 2 ( the processing times  size factor for the units and cost for each product ) . 
 the set of decision variables consists of the batch size  the total production time  the number of parallel units at each stage  the cycle time for each product  and the required volume of a unit in each stage . since the number of parallel units at each stage is an integer decision variable  we code this variable as a binary variable . 
 in addition to the constraints expressed by ( 5)(8 )  we consider bounds on objective functions as additional constraints to generate feasible nondominated solutions in the range desired by the decision - maker  to have 19 constraints in all 
				
					 ( 10)filfifiu   i  =  1  4 . 
 then nsga - ii is employed to solve the optimization problem with the following parameters : maximum number of generation up to 200  population size 500  probability of crossover 0.85  probability of mutation 0.05  distribution index for the simulated crossover operation 10 and distribution index for the simulated mutation operation 20 . 
 the revenue ( f1 ) increases with the increase in operation cost ( f3 )  while the investment cost ( f2 ) decreases . 
 when all the four objective functions are considered simultaneously  solutions obtained in the present study show improvement as by huang and wang   results for the same problem . 
 for example  let us consider the solution presented by huang and wang   with unit reference membership level for all objectives : f1 = 121 350  f2 = 171 624  f3 = 77 299  f4 = 5667 . the solution ( 1 ) presented in table 3 of the present study improves the above solution f1  f3  f4 while   f2   is comparable . 
 the large set of multiple optimal solutions provides the decision maker with immediate information about the relationship among the several objective criteria and a set of feasible solutions . 
 thus  it helps the decision - maker to select a highly confident choice of solution . 
 the fixed optimal plant structure as 221 corresponds to a two mixers  two reactors  and one centrifuge design . 
 the batch plant in this case consists of four processing stages to manufacture three products a  b  and c  with four - objective optimization problem as expressed in ( 1)(4 ) . 
 but we deal with 4 integer variables  14 real variables  and 31 constraints which includes bounds on objective functions . 
 the same model equations of example   1 are used here except the processing time  ij in ( 7 ) . 
 the time required to process one batch of product i in stage j is expressed as : 
				
					 ( 11)ij=ij+cijbij   i   j  
							 where ij  0  cij  0 and j are constants and bi is the batch size for product i. thus  the processing time is not a constant  but depends on the decision parameters of the batch size . 
 the constrained multiobjective minlp problem is solved by nsga - ii with the same set of nsga - ii parameters as used in example 1 . as in example   1 
  the revenue ( f1 ) increases as operation cost ( f3 ) increases  while the investment cost ( f2 ) decreases following operation cost ( f3 ) . 
 let mention that when all four objective functions are considered simultaneously  the solutions obtained in the present study improve significantly the results presented by huang and wang   for the same problem . 
 for example  the solution presented by huang and wang   with unit reference membership level for all objectives ( f1 = 274 312  f2 = 375 688  f3 = 175 688  f4 = 5639 ) the solution ( 1 ) presented in table 4 of the present study improves the above solution f1  f3  f4 while f2 is comparable .   in this example  the plant structure evolved as optimal is : two mixers  two reactors  two extractors  and one centrifuge as presented in figure 7 . 
 implementation of a trade - off analysis is dependent upon the availability of the decision - maker 's preferences . 
 a multiobjective decision in a batch plant process design is considered and a non dominating sorting genetic algorithm ( nsga - ii ) is developed to get an optimal zone containing solutions under the concept of pareto set . 
 nsga - ii capability has been proved in evolving the entire set of nondominating solutions along the pareto front in a single run of the algorithm . 
 thus  the decision maker ( dm ) is provided with the best trade - off operating zone . 
 furthermore  a better confident choice of design among several compromises of the decision maker can be   achieved if the decision variables effects on the objective functions are known . 
 finally  the large set of solutions presents a useful base for further alternative approaches to fulfil the dm targets . 
 the inherent dynamic nature of batch processes allows for their ability to handle variations in feedstock and product specifications and provides the flexibility required for multiproduct or multipurpose facilities . 
 they are thus best suited for the manufacture of low - volume  high - value products  such as specialty chemicals  pharmaceuticals  agricultural  food  and consumer products  and most recently the constantly growing spectrum of biotechnology - enabled products . reduced time to market  lower production costs  and improved flexibility are all critical success factors for batch processes .","

"since the introduction of extra - oral implants in reconstruction of craniofacial defects  achieving proper prosthesis retention has become more promising . 
 these problems include ulceration of hard and/or soft tissues used for retention  lack of retention due to prosthesis movement  and tissue irritation caused by adhesives . 
 the ideal position and number of implants for restoring orbital defects would be three non - linear implants in lateral  supraorbital  and infra - orbital rims . however  such implant arrangement is not always conceivable considering the extension of the defect  and bone quality and quantity of defect s walls . 
 two of the most common retention systems used in reconstruction of orbital defects include freestanding abutments with magnetic retention and bar - clip retention . 
 magnetic abutments are more common because they resolve the potential problems associated with bar - clip attachment including difficulty in insertion and removal of prosthesis by the patient  difficulty in regular hygiene measurements  and rigidity of the attachment resulting in implant overloading . 
 however  magnetic attachment might not provide sufficient retention if implants have been placed adjacently . 
 the presence of implant in the defective area might complicate the usual impression - taking procedures used in fabrication of conventional craniofacial prostheses . 
 accuracy of the impression is affected by defect shape  retention system  number  and divergence of the implants . 
 moreover  anatomical undercuts in the defect  and proximity or remoteness of the implants could complicate the impression - taking procedure . 
 use of multiple trays  elastomeric impression materials  and dual impression technique have been suggested to overcome such problems [ 21214 ] . 
 the purpose of this article was to present a case treated with an implant - supported prosthesis to reconstruct a relatively large orbital defect using three adjacent implants in the lateral orbital rim . 
 a 60-year - old woman with a left orbital defect due to removal of periocular basal cell tumor was referred to the implant department of tehran university of medical sciences  school of dentistry  for prosthetic reconstruction of the eye . 
 three implants ( superline  dentium  seoul  south korea )  8 mm in length and 3.6 mm in diameter were placed in the lateral rim of the orbit . although the most suitable sites for orbital implants are the superior and lateral rims  in the present case the implants have been placed adjacently  due to insufficient bone thickness in superior and inferior orbital rims . 
 the defect was relatively deep with undercuts in the medial wall which could complicate impression making . 
 the preferred prosthesis design was an implant - supported prosthesis with a custom bar containing properly distributed magnetic components . 
 the healing abutments were unscrewed and three hexed direct - casting abutments ( implantium  dentium  seoul  south korea ) with 4.5 mm diameter were directly secured to the implants . 
 the medial undercuts were blocked out  using a gauze pack to avoid the penetration of acrylic resin . an auto - polymerizing acrylic resin ( pattern resin  gc  tokyo  japan ) pattern 
 was formed directly on the abutments in a manner that cobalt samarium ( co5sm ) magnets ( implantium  dentium  seoul  south korea )  with 5.5 mm diameter and retention force of 700 gram could be placed at proper distances in the superior  inferior and lateral segments of the acrylic bar ( fig . 
 the acrylic resin bar was casted using base metal alloy ( aalba dent inc . ; 
 cordelia  c.a  usa ) and the magnet keepers were cemented in corresponding sites with panavia f 2.0 resin cement ( kurary medical inc  japan ) . acrylic resin pattern of bar containing indentations for magnets ( a )  try - in of metal bar on the implants with magnet keepers in place ( b ) . 
 the space beneath the superstructure and also the undercuts in defect walls were blocked out with gauze packs . 
 the final impression was made in order to pick up the magnets and simultaneously record the rest of the orbital defect . 
 light viscosity addition silicone ( panasil  kettenbach  germany ) was used as the first layer to cover the entire defect as well as the intact side of the midface . afterwards  regular viscosity addition silicone ( panasil  kettenbach  germany ) was used over the light viscosity material to create mechanical retention projections for the gypsum layer ( herostone vigodent inc . 
 the wax pattern of the orbit was formed containing an ocular prosthesis which simulated the properties of a healthy eye . 
 the pattern was tried on the patient and some modifications were made to improve its esthetic and adaptation . 
 the prosthesis was made of a combination of heat - cured acrylic resin for holding the magnets  and high - temperature vulcanizing silicone with internal / external staining and other characterizations of the skin  such as wrinkles  eye brow and eye lashes . 
 the final prosthesis was delivered to the patient and necessary home care instructions were provided such as removing the prosthesis during night  cleaning the eye defect with damp gauze  and the need for regular biannual follow - ups [ 69 ] .

 the patient presented here has been treated with an implant - supported orbital prosthesis with bar - magnetic attachment . 
 this retention mechanism might minimize the risk of mechanical overload on the implants compared to a conventional bar - clip attachment with cantilever arms . despite the proximity of implants  
 the mentioned distribution of magnetic attachments has increased the retention through creating a tripod . furthermore  since the acrylic resin pattern of the bar was made directly in the defective area  no implant or abutment analogues were used in final impression procedure . 
 prolonged chair - side time is a disadvantage of the stated method which could be justified considering the mentioned advantages .","

1) Abstract: This report presents a technique for creating an implant-supported orbital prosthesis using a bar-magnetic attachment for a 60-year-old female patient. This method is effective for restoring defective areas in the face and cranium, and the type of attachment chosen depends on the position of the implants.

2) Research and Discussion: Implant-supported craniofacial prostheses are a common solution for restoring defects in the face and cranium. In this case, the patient had three implants in the left lateral orbital rim, making the bar-magnetic attachment the appropriate choice for retention. The use of individual magnetic abutments versus a bar-clip attachment can significantly impact the success of the prosthesis.

3) Results and Conclusion: In this case, the utilization of a bar-magnetic attachment proved to be successful in retaining the implant-supported orbital prosthesis. This technique allows for effective restoration of defective areas in the face and cranium. It is important to carefully consider the position of the implants when choosing the attachment system for implant-supported craniofacial prostheses. "
"hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) is one of the most common cancers worldwide especially in china [ 13 ] . 
 the high hcc rates in china largely reflect the elevated prevalence of chronic hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) infection . in developed countries such as united states  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld )  associated with obesity  
 less study focused on the effect of obesity on hcc especially in the relationship between bmi and hcc . 
 no study has focused on the effect of waistline on the surgical outcome of hcc patients . 
 so  this study is about the influence of body mass index ( bmi ) and waistline on complications  postoperative death and long - time survival in patients undergoing surgery for hcc . 
 between january 2007 and december 2012  we retrospectively reviewed the database of 136 patients underwent hepatic resection for hcc at the department of surgery of the fourth affiliated hospital of zhejiang university school of medicine . 
 this retrospective study had been performed with the approval of the ethics committee of the fourth affiliated hospital of zhejiang university school of medicine and was in compliance with the helsinki declaration . written informed consent was given by participants for their clinical records to be used in this study . 
 we enrolled 136 patients and divided them into 4 groups : group a  bmi < 25 ; group b  bmi 25 ; group c  waistline < 90 cm in males or waistline < 80 cm in females ; group d  waistline 90 cm in males or waistline 80 cm in females . 
 there were 61 patients ( 44.9% ) in group a  75 patients ( 55.1% ) in group b  58 patients ( 42.6% ) in group c  and 78 patients ( 57.4% ) in group d. all patients followed the same preoperative evaluation protocol  including blood biochemistry  ultrasonography  and computed tomography of the liver . 
 the criteria for resection included good general condition  absence of essential organ dysfunction and distant metastasis  and liver function ( child a or b  icg r15 < 15% ) . 
 follow - up data were obtained by direct communication with patients after they underwent hepatic resection . 
 survival analysis  including overall survival and disease - free survival  was estimated by the kaplan - meier survival method and compared using the log - rank test . 
 all statistical analyses were performed using statistical software ( spss 13.0 for windows  spss  chicago  il ) at a significant level of p<0.05 . 
 there were 110 ( 80.9% ) men and 26 ( 19.1% ) women who underwent hepatectomy . 
 the median age was 43 years ; 118 ( 86.8% ) patients were ages < 60 years and 18 ( 13.2% ) patients were older than 60 years . 
 there were 61 ( 44.9 ) patients with normal bmi ( < 25 ) and 75 ( 55.1% ) patients were overweight or obese ( bmi 25 ) . 
 fifty - eight patients ( 42.6% ) belong to group c and 78 patients ( 57.4% ) belong to group d. ninety - seven ( 71.3% ) patients had positive hepatitis b and 39 ( 28.7% ) patients without hbv . 
 histopathology of the hcc confirmed vascular invasion in 41 patients ( 30.1% ) and liver cirrhosis in 65 ( 47.8% ) patients . 
 surgical results confirmed capsular formation in 54 ( 39.7% ) patients and 51 ( 37.5% ) patients with solitary hcc ( table 1 ) . 
 the intraoperative and postoperative data including major complications of 136 patients with hcc are shown in table 2 and supplementary table 1 . 
 the median hospital stay was 11 days in group a and 12 days in group b  with no significant difference between the 2 groups ( p=0.373 ) . 
 a  23 ( 37.7% ) patients had blood loss 1000 ml compared to 29 ( 38.7% ) patients in group b. there was no hospital death in group a and 1 ( 1.3% ) hospital death in group b. however  no significant difference was found between the 2 groups . there were no significant differences in overall postoperative complication rate between group a and group b  although pulmonary infection showed a significant difference between these 2 groups ( p=0.017 ) . 
 seven ( 11.5% ) patients had complications in group a compared to 9 ( 12% ) patients in group b. the most common complications in group a were ascites and wound infection  while the most common complications in group b were pulmonary infection and wound infection . 
 variables that might affect overall survival of patients with hcc after hepatic resection were analyzed in this study . 
 on univariate analysis of the prognostic factors  we found that patients with bmi 25  waistline 90 cm ( or 80 cm in women ) and vascular invasion had poor overall survival than that without these variables ( p=0.032  p=0.017  p=0.009 ) . 
 the other variables such as sex  afp level  and blood loss were not the significant prognostic factors of overall survival . 
 on multivariate analysis  however  only vascular invasion and waistline were significantly associated with overall survival ( p=0.031  p=0.039 ) . 
 the other variables  including bmi  were not independent prognostic factors of overall survival on multivariate analysis ( table 3 ) . 
 the overall survival curves of hcc patients according to the bmi are shown in figure 1 . 
 the 1-  3-  and 5-year overall survival rates of group a were 95%  81%  and 16%  respectively . 
 the 1-  3-  and 5-year disease - free survival rates of these patients were 78%  38% and 4%  respectively ( figure 1 ) . 
 however  there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in disease - free survival ( p=0.235 ) . 
 the overall and disease - free survival curves of hcc patients affected by waistline were shown in figure 2 . 
 the 1-  3-  and 5-year overall survival rates of group c were 97%  88%  respectively  and 15% compared to 96%  68%  15%  respectively  in group d. the 1-  3-  and 5-year disease - free survival rates of group c were 84%  40% and 6%  respectively . 
 group c had significant better overall survival and disease - free survival than group d ( p=0.028  p=0.048 ) . 
 there were 110 ( 80.9% ) men and 26 ( 19.1% ) women who underwent hepatectomy .

 histopathology of the hcc confirmed vascular invasion in 41 patients ( 30.1% ) and liver cirrhosis in 65 ( 47.8% ) patients . 
 surgical results confirmed capsular formation in 54 ( 39.7% ) patients and 51 ( 37.5% ) patients with solitary hcc ( table 1 ) .

 seven ( 11.5% ) patients had complications in group a compared to 9 ( 12% ) patients in group b. the most common complications in group a were ascites and wound infection  while the most common complications in group b were pulmonary infection and wound infection . 
 variables that might affect overall survival of patients with hcc after hepatic resection were analyzed in this study . 
 on univariate analysis of the prognostic factors  we found that patients with bmi 25  waistline 90 cm ( or 80 cm in women ) and vascular invasion had poor overall survival than that without these variables ( p=0.032  p=0.017  p=0.009 ) .

 the overall survival curves of hcc patients according to the bmi are shown in figure 1 . 
 the 1-  3-  and 5-year overall survival rates of group a were 95%  81%  and 16%  respectively . 
 the 1-  3-  and 5-year disease - free survival rates of these patients were 78%  38% and 4%  respectively ( figure 1 ) . 
 however  there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in disease - free survival ( p=0.235 ) . 
 the overall and disease - free survival curves of hcc patients affected by waistline were shown in figure 2 . 
 the 1-  3-  and 5-year overall survival rates of group c were 97%  88%  respectively  and 15% compared to 96%  68%  15%  respectively  in group d. the 1-  3-  and 5-year disease - free survival rates of group c were 84%  40% and 6%  respectively . 
 group c had significant better overall survival and disease - free survival than group d ( p=0.028  p=0.048 ) . 
 there are many reports about the relationship between bmi  the size of waistline  and cancer risk [ 714 ] . 
 research conducted by the cancer council of victoria  australia shows that a waist measurement of over 100 cm for men and over 85 cm for women can significantly increase the risk of cancer including breast  bowel  and aggressive prostate cancer . 
 however  there were few reports about the relationship between bmi  waistline  and hcc . 
 the high hcc rates in china are largely due to the prevalence of chronic hepatitis b virus infection . however  with the increase in prevalence of obesity  nafld  which can progress to cirrhosis and subsequently to the development of hcc  is now recognized as one of the most common liver diseases in china . although many reports had affirmed that patient with higher bmi tend to show a higher incidence of liver cirrhosis  there are few reports about the relationship between the bmi and the surgical outcome of hepatectomy for hcc [ 1517 ] . regarding the relationship between bmi  waistline  and obesity  we hypothesized that waistline might be related to surgical outcome of hepatectomy for hcc  as well . in this study  there were no significant differences in postoperative complication rate and postoperative death between group a and group b. however  pulmonary infection ( 13.3% ) showed a significant difference between the 2 groups ( p=0.017 ) . the observation that the obese patients had more pulmonary infection after hepatectomy for hcc 
 can be explained by the fact that obesity can reduce pulmonary function through diminishing exercise capacity and lung volume  and increasing the resistance of breathing . 
 vascular invasion  waistline  and bmi are the independent prognostic factors for long - term survival . 
 group c had better overall and disease - free survival than group d  and group a had the better overall survival than group b. this result showed that bmi and waistline are both independent prognostic factors for long - term survival . 
 waistline may be more important than bmi in predicting the prognosis of hcc after hepatectomy . 
 obesity  which can lead to nafld and finally progress to cirrhosis  is thought to account for the majority of hcc [ 1821 ] . with the increase in prevalence of obesity  
 we recommend that individuals whose bmi or waistline exceeds normal limits should cultivate a healthy lifestyle  such as eating foods that help to lose weight  regular physical exercise  and getting enough sleep . 
 in conclusion  overweight and obesity have been shown to be significant predictors of an adverse long - time survival after hepatectomy for hcc . 
 waistline is more important than bmi in predicting the disease - free survival of hcc after hepatectomy .

Abstract: This study aimed to examine the impact of body mass index (BMI) and waistline on complications, postoperative death, and long-term survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing surgery. A total of 136 patients were retrospectively analyzed and divided into four groups based on BMI and waistline measurements. Results showed waistline to be a more significant prognostic factor for long-term survival, while BMI had a minimal impact.

Research and Discussion: The study found no significant differences in postoperative complications and death between patients with lower BMI and those with higher BMI. However, there was a significant difference in pulmonary infection rates. Vascular invasion, waistline, and BMI were all identified as independent prognostic factors for long-term survival. The overall survival of patients with a waistline <90 cm for males or <80 cm for females was better than those with a larger waistline.

Results and Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of BMI and waistline measurements in predicting long-term survival in HCC patients undergoing surgery. Waistline was found to be more critical than BMI in determining disease-free survival, while BMI showed minimal significance. These findings have implications on the management and follow-up of HCC patients, suggesting the need for focused monitoring of patients with a higher waistline. "
"professional mononuclear phagocytes  such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils ( pmn )  monocytes  and macrophages  are considered as the first line of defence of the early host innate immune response [ 1  2 ] . 
 their main function has been classically understood to kill invasive pathogens by a variety of potent intracellular microbicidal effector mechanisms [ 37 ] . 
 after the first contact with pathogens  mononuclear phagocytes engulf and internalize them into their phagosomes . by the fusion with intracellular granules and the formation of phagolysosomes the pathogens 
 may be killed intracellularly by a combination of non - oxidative and oxidative mechanisms [ 1  8 ] . 
 actions of potent antimicrobial peptides  such as defensins  cathelicidins  cathepsins  pentraxin  and lactoferrin  are parts of non - oxidative killing mechanisms  while oxidative killing relies exclusively on the production of antimicrobial reactive oxygen species ( ros ) via the nadph oxidase ( nox ) complex . within blood circulating phagocytes  
 pmn are by far the most abundant cell population representing 5080% of the total white blood cells in different vertebrates . moreover  after being released from the bone marrow into the blood circulation  pmn are highly mobile and short - lived phagocytes  being densely packed with secretory granules [ 4  8 ] . 
 pmn granules are categorized into three different types based on their contents : primary ( azurophilic )  secondary ( specific )  and tertiary ( gelatinase ) granules . 
 the types of granules to be found in circulating pmn depend on their maturation stage . 
 thus  pmn maturation starts with the formation of primary granules  followed by secondary and tertiary granules [ 4  9  10 ] . 
 the content of primary granules includes myeloperoxidase ( mpo )  neutrophil elastase ( ne )  cathepsin g  proteinase 3  defensins  and lysozyme ; secondary granules contain collagenase  gelatinase  cystatin  lysozyme  and lactoferrin ; and tertiary granules comprise gelatinase  lysozyme  and arginase amongst others . 
 following granule maturation  pmn will possess all three types of granules displaying full killing capacity not only in the blood but also in tissues / organs and gut lumen . 
 in addition  pmn act against pathogens by actively participating in complex inflammatory networks such as the release of a broad panel of proinflammatory chemokines  cytokines  and survival- and growth - factors which trigger both downstream proinflammatory effects and the transition into adaptive immune reactions . as such 
  several proinflammatory cytokines / chemokines were found enhanced in activated pmn in response to apicomplexan parasites  such as tnf-  il-1  cc  and cxc chemokines ( e.g.  il-8  ip-10  gro-  rantes  and mip-1 ) [ 1115 ] . 
 several of pmn - derived immunomodulatory molecules can augment the production of various chemokines and cytokines to further regulate phagocyte functions [ 16  17 ] . 
 more importantly  by this means activated pmn recruit not only other innate immune cells but also t cells to the site of infection [ 1820 ] or even induce sterile inflammation [ 21  22 ] . 
 beginning with the landmark study of brinkmann et al .  the paradigm of how pmn fight and kill pathogenic bacteria has profoundly been changed . 
 the discovery of dna - based antimicrobial neutrophil extracellular traps ( nets ) changed the current knowledge on innate immune reactions not only on the level of the pathogen killing but also on the pathophysiology of metabolic  autoimmune  reproductive  and inflammatory diseases  as well as cancer progression [ 3237 ] . 
 nets are released by activated pmn by a novel cell death process  called netosis  which can be stimulated by a variety of molecules and invasive pathogens . 
 microorganisms such as bacteria [ 31  3941 ]  fungi [ 4244 ]  viruses [ 4549 ]  and parasites [ 5055 ] were identified as net inducers . 
 also different molecules or cellular structures such as gm - csf / complement factor 5a [ 56  57 ]  activated platelets [ 40  58 ]  pma and zymosan [ 24  26  31  59 ]  singlet oxygen  lps [ 31  61 ]  and fc receptor   trigger netosis . in addition  il-8 as well - known chemoattractant for pmn was demonstrated as net inducer [ 31  62 ] . 
 efficient netosis requires mature pmn and in most cases nox  mpo  ne  and peptidylarginine deiminase type iv ( pad4 ) activities [ 14  24  59  6365 ] . 
 furthermore  the process of netosis obviously requires intracellularly signalling pathways of which raf - mek - erk kinases as well as p38 mapk are being the most frequently reported to be involved in this process [ 14  23  33  6669 ] . 
 in addition  calcium release is needed for optimal net formation in different vertebrate species [ 14  23  7072 ] . upon stimulation of pmn 
  the nuclear envelope disintegrates permitting the mixture of chromatin with granular proteins / peptides . 
 ne and mpo degrade histones ( h1  h2a / h2b  h3  and h4 ) and promote chromatin decondensation  mediated by pad4 via hypercitrullinating of specific histones to allow electrostatic coiling of the chromatin [ 64  73  74 ] . 
 the total of the dna complexes being decorated with granular proteins / peptides and specific histones ( h1  h2a / h2b  h3  and h4 ) are finally extruded as nets to the extracellular environment by dying pmn . 
 net formation is primarily a nox - dependent mechanism [ 14  24  59  75  76 ] . 
 however  nox - independent netosis was also reported [ 29  60  67  68  77 ] . 
 this mode of netosis is accompanied by a substantially lower level of erk activation and rather moderate level of akt activation  whereas activation of p38 is similar in both kinds of net formation [ 67  68 ] . as an example 
 irrespectively of nox - dependency  pathogens may either be immobilised within sticky dna fibres [ 55  78  79 ] or be killed via the local high concentration of effector molecules [ 31  42  51  53 ] 
 . meanwhile  other types of leukocytes of the innate immune system  such as macrophages [ 8083 ]  monocytes [ 26  28 ]  mast cells [ 84  85 ]  eosinophils [ 55  86  87 ]  and also basophils  have been reported to release net - like structures which are now collectively entitled as extracellular traps ( ets ) . 
 described already many years ago that enucleated pmn may remain vital and are even capable of killing invasive microbes . 
 more recent studies corroborated these findings proving that leukocytes do not necessarily die after et extrusion [ 56  68  86 ] . in this context  yousefi et al . 
 [ 56  86 ] demonstrated that eosinophils and certain pmn subpopulations release ets of mitochondrial origin without dying . 
 furthermore  yipp et al .   verified that pmn which had released nets were still viable and retained their capability to engulf bacteria via phagocytosis . 
 however  it appears to be nonlethal for pmn and faster than nox - dependent net formation and to rely on a vesicular - based pathway releasing nuclear dna [ 33  68 ] . 
 additionally  different molecular pathways will lead in a stimulus - dependent manner to the extrusion of different types of ets in vitro and in vivo . 
 different morphological forms of ets were for the first time described in the human gout disease in vivo proving that monosodium urate crystals ( msu ) induced aggregated ( aggets )  spread ( sprets )  and diffused ( diffets ) et formation . 
 as such  the parasitic nematode haemonchus contortus larvae triggered in ruminant pmn and eosinophils aggets  spreets  and diffets . 
 while most net- and et - related studies focused on bacterial  viral  and fungal pathogens  little attention was paid to protozoan parasites . as such  the first ever published study on parasite - triggered netosis was published in 2008 by baker et al . 
 4 years after the discovery of this novel effector mechanism   and reported on plasmodium falciparum - triggered net formation . 
 parasites are mosquito - borne pathogens that cause malaria  a serious public health disease worldwide in the tropic and subtropics . 
 globally  an estimated 3.3 billion people are at risk of being infected with malaria of whom approximately 1.2 billion are at high risk ( > 1 in 1000 chance ) of developing malarial disease . 
 the first report on p. falciparum - induced nets referred to p. falciparum - infected children and demonstrated in vivo net - entrapped trophozoite - infected erythrocytes in blood samples . 
 moreover  baker and colleagues   provided first evidence on the involvement of parasite - triggered nets in the pathogenesis of malaria since the high levels of anti - dsdna antibodies were above the predictive levels for autoimmunity . 
 interestingly  a recent study also indicates the capacity of p. falciparum to inhibit net formation   which may be of relevance in immunopathogenesis . 
 thus  a mosquito - derived salivary protease inhibitor ( agaphelin ) induced by p. falciparum infection inhibited vertebrate elastase and net formation . whether this represents a true anti - net mechanism remains to be elucidated . 
 parasites of the genus eimeria are worldwide of high veterinary and economic importance in livestock  especially in chicken  cattle and small ruminants [ 95100 ] . 
 coccidiosis is a disease with high morbidity in animals of all ages  nonetheless inducing pathogenicity especially in young animals   and occasionally causing death of heavily infected animals [ 99  102  103 ] . 
 several studies showed that pmn infiltrate intestinal mucosa in response to eimeria infections and are occasionally found in close contact to the parasitic stages in vivo [ 102  104107 ] . 
 pmn have also been shown to directly interact with e. bovis stages and antigens in vitro  resulting in release of proinflammatory cytokines  chemokines  and inos . 
 additionally  their phagocytic and oxidative burst activities were enhanced in response to eimeria stages in vitro and in vivo . 
 first indications on eimeria spp . as potent net inducers came from behrendt and colleagues who reported on sporozoites to be entangled by an extracellular network of delicate dna fibres being extruded from pmn in vitro ( figure 1(a ) ) . using extracellular dna measurements and dnase treatments 
 other studies confirmed typical characteristics of nets  such as the colocalization of ne  mpo  and histones in the dna backbone of eimeria - induced net - like structures . 
 meanwhile  also other pathogenic ruminant eimeria species were shown to induce netosis  such as e. arloingi ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) [ 24  27 ] and e. ninakohlyakimovae ( prez  personal communication ) . 
 importantly  muoz - caro and colleagues proved nets also to occur in vivo in eimeria - infected gut mucosa . 
 the current data suggest that eimeria - induced netosis is a species- and stage - independent mechanism  since it was induced by sporozoites  merozoites i  or oocysts of different eimeria species [ 23  24 ] . 
 given that pmn were described to act even in the intestinal lumen via different effector mechanisms [ 27  108  109 ]  it appears likely that interactions of luminal pmn with ingested eimeria oocysts or newly excysted sporozoites may occur [ 6  23  24 ] . in particular  net - related reactions against oocysts 
 would have a high impact on the ongoing infection since they may hamper proper excystation of infective stages ( sporozoites ) and  in consequence  dampen the degree of infection at the earliest possible time point in the host . since e. arloingi sporozoites must egress from the oocyst circumplasm through the micropyle  nets covering this area of the oocyst will have a detrimental effect on proper excystation [ 6  24 ] . the same explanation seems feasible for e. bovis and e. ninakohlyakimovae  regardless of the fact that excystation occurs by rupture of the oocyst walls prior to sporozoites egress from sporocysts . although all eimeria species tested so far equally induced nets  significant differences in entrapment effectivity were reported amongst different host species  parasite species  and stages . 
 thus  caprine nets immobilised a high proportion of e. arloingi sporozoites ( 72% )  whilst in the bovine system considerably less parasite stages ( e. bovis sporozoites : 43%  b. besnoiti tachyzoites : 34% ) were found entrapped in net structures [ 23  59 ] . 
 so far  it remains to be elucidated whether the varying effectivity of nets is based on the pmn origin ( goats are generally considered as strong immune responders ) or on the parasite species . 
 the molecular basis of eimeria - induced netosis is not entirely understood  so far . 
 enzyme activity measurements and inhibition studies revealed a key role of nox  ne  and mpo in eimeria - triggered net formation ( see table 1 ) which is in agreement to bacterial  fungal  and parasitic pathogens [ 14  25  59  65  75  110 ] . referring to signal cascades  analyses on the grade of phosphorylation revealed a key role of erk1/2 and p38 mapk in sporozoite - exposed bovine pmn . since respective inhibitor experiments led to decreased parasite - mediated net formation  muoz - caro et al . 
 this finding is in agreement with data on t. gondii - mediated net formation . referring to ca influx  further inhibition experiments proved e. bovis - mediated netosis as dependent on intracellular ca mobilization  since 2-abp ( inhibitor of store - operated ca entry )   and bapta - am ( binding intracellular ca ; muoz - caro  unpublished data ) but not egta ( inhibitor of ca influx from the extracellular compartment ; muoz - caro  unpublished data ) significantly blocked parasite - triggered netosis . so far  
 .   reported on enhanced cd11b surface expression on pmn following e. bovis sporozoite exposure . by antibody - mediated cd11b blockage leading to a significant reduction of parasite - triggered netosis 
 bacteria and fungi netosis was reported as a lethal effector mechanism [ 31  42 ] . however  killing effects of nets were not observed in the case of eimeria spp . so far . given that eimeria spp . 
 are obligate intracellular parasites  the main function of nets rather seems to be the extracellular immobilisation of infective stages hampering them from host cell invasion . 
 accordingly  reduced host cell infections rates were reported for e. bovis and e. arloingi sporozoites when previously exposed to pmn [ 23  24 ] . the same feature was reported for monocyte - preexposed e. bovis sporozoites indicating that this leukocyte cell type also casts ets in response to this parasite stage and that etosis had an impact on parasite invasion . 
 besides e. bovis  e. arloingi ( silva  unpublished data )  and e. ninakohlyakimovae ( prez et al .  submitted manuscript ) were also shown to induce monocytes - derived ets . 
 furthermore  e. ninakohlyakimovae - induced monocytes - etosis showed a rapid induction of ets release upon viable sporozoites  sporocysts  and oocysts encounters  corroborating a stage - independent process in monocyte - derived etosis . 
 in addition  it was found that caprine monocyte - derived - etosis is nox - dependent . with the upregulation of the genes transcription encoding for il-12 and tnf-  relevant immunoregulatory cytokines with transition properties into the adaptive immunity 
 were also demonstrated in e. ninakohlyakimovae - exposed caprine monocytes ( prez et al  submitted manuscript ) . 
 since the reduction in infection rates early after infection automatically results in decreased proliferation of the parasite  this indirect et - mediated effect should have a beneficial impact on the outcome of the disease . 
 despite advantageous properties of ets  their ineffective clearance and/or poor regulation might also bear adverse pathological implications  leading to tissue damage in addition to enhanced local proinflammatory reactions [ 112  113 ] . 
 toxoplasmosis is caused by the facultative heteroxenous apicomplexan polyxenous protozoan t. gondii representing one of the most common parasitic zoonoses worldwide . 
 toxoplasma gondii is well known to affect almost all warm - blooded mammals including a wide range of domestic animals  wild mammals  marine mammals  marsupials  and humans [ 115  116 ] . in response to t. gondii infections  pmn 
 are promptly recruited to the site of infection producing a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [ 11  117 ] . 
 in addition  pmn are capable of killing t. gondii tachyzoites via phagocytosis [ 118  119 ] . 
 besides this effector mechanism  human  murine  bovine  and harbour seal ( phoca vitulina ) pmn additionally perform netosis in reaction to t. gondii tachyzoites ( figures 1(c ) and 1(d ) ) [ 25  26 ] . 
 abi abdallah et al .   showed that netosis was triggered by tachyzoites in a parasite strain - independent fashion as an invasion / phagocytosis - independent process . 
 interestingly  in the murine toxoplasmosis model  tachyzoites - induced nets were not the result of a random cell lysis  but of a controlled dna release process since lysozyme was still present in pmn after performing netosis [ 25  120 ] . 
 in contrast to eimeria spp .  t. gondii - triggered netosis had modest toxoplasmacidal effects by killing up to 25% of the parasites . 
 considering the obligate intracellular life style of t. gondii and its enormous proliferative capacity in mammalian host cells  parasite entrapment via nets might be of particular importance in vivo based on its interference with host cell invasion . 
 consistently  harbour seal pmn - promoted nets significantly hampered host cell invasion of t. gondii tachyzoites in vitro . 
 in vivo evidence of t. gondii - induced netosis was reported in a murine pulmonary infection model  revealing an increase of dsdna contents in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of t. gondii - infected mice . as equally reported for several other coccidian parasites [ 14  23 ]  t. gondii - induced nets 
 were also proven to be nox-  ne-  mpo-  and ca- ( soce ) dependent and to be mediated by an erk 1/2-related signalling pathway in pmn ( see table 1 ) [ 25  26 ] . additionally  in earlier studies  not only the pivotal role of pmn but also the important role of monocytes in toxoplasmosis was clearly demonstrated [ 121123 ] ; however  their capacity to also induce ets in response to tachyzoite stages was just recently demonstrated . 
 exposure of harbour seal - derived monocytes to viable t. gondii tachyzoites resulted in a significant induction of monocyte - ets and tachyzoites were firmly entrapped and immobilised within harbour seal monocyte - et structures  hampering parasite replication . 
 bovine besnoitiosis caused by besnoitia besnoiti is an endemic disease in africa and asia [ 124126 ] and considered as emergent in europe . during the acute phase of cattle besnoitiosis 
  b. besnoiti tachyzoites mainly replicate in host endothelial cells of different organs [ 28  128 ] and  upon release  may be exposed to circulating leukocytes . 
 besnoitia besnoiti tachyzoites were recently reported as effective inducers of pmn- and monocyte - derived ets ( figures 1(e )  1(g )  and 1(h ) ) [ 28  59 ] . in the latter case  
 a high proportion of pmn was found to be involved in netosis  since up to 76% of encountered pmn were found to participate in netosis leading to the immobilisation of approximately one - third of the parasites . 
 besnoitia besnoiti - triggered netosis furthermore proved as vitality - independent process that was even induced by soluble parasite molecules ( homogenates )  though at lower levels . 
 regarding pmn - derived effector molecules  nox  ne  and mpo proved as essential for efficient b. besnoiti - triggered netosis . 
 thus  respective enzyme activities were encountered in tachyzoite - exposed pmn and chemical blockage of these enzymes via inhibitors blocked parasite - triggered netosis [ 28  59 ] . 
 in contrast to tachyzoites of t. gondii  entrapped b. besnoiti tachyzoites were neither killed by nets nor ets since their host cell infectivity was entirely restored upon dnase i treatments [ 28  59 ] . given 
 that b. besnoiti tachyzoites mainly proliferate within endothelial cells during the acute phase  these parasitic stages are released via cell lysis in close proximity to endothelium and are exposed to blood contents  such as leukocytes . 
 several reports have shown that nets themselves interact with endothelium and may cause endothelial damage or dysfunction [ 129131 ] . 
 since activated endothelial cells may produce a broad panel of immunomodulatory molecules with il-8 or p - selectin having been identified as potent net inducers [ 129  132 ]  interactions between infected endothelial cells  b. besnoiti tachyzoites  and nets are quite likely . 
 recently reported on infection - induced upregulation of endothelial - derived il-8 and p - selectin gene transcription and furthermore presented indications on net formation occurring adjacent to infected endothelium after pmn adhesion assays being performed under physiological flow conditions as the ones present in small vessels . 
 recent net - related investigations on the closely related cyst - forming apicomplexan protozoa neospora caninum have shown that bovine pmn exposed to viable tachyzoites also result in strong netosis ( figure 1(f ) ) . with regard to molecular mechanisms  n. caninum - triggered netosis seems to be p2y2-  nox-  soce-  mpo-  ne-  erk1/2-  p38 mapk-  and pad4-dependent ( villagra - blanco et al .  submitted manuscript ) . 
 cryptosporidium parvum is an euryxenous apicomplexan parasite with worldwide distribution and high zoonotic potential  mainly affecting young children  immunocompromised humans  and neonatal livestock . typically  cryptosporidiosis is a water- and food - borne enteric disease that causes diarrhoea  dehydration  weight losses  and abdominal pain and leads to significant economic losses in the livestock industry [ 133  134 ] . 
 after ingestion  sporozoites are released from oocysts into the intestinal lumen and infect small intestine epithelial cells . 
 recent studies reported on a significant contribution of pmn and macrophages to inflammatory responses in cryptosporidiosis in vivo [ 136  137 ] . 
 muoz - caro and colleagues reported on nets being cast by both bovine and human pmn in response to c. parvum stages . 
 parasite - triggered netosis proved stage - independent since it was induced by both sporozoites and oocysts ( figure 1(b ) ) . especially in the latter case parasite stages were occasionally entirely covered with net structures thereby most probably hampering proper sporozoite excystation . 
 given that pmn were shown as active even within the intestinal lumen [ 108  109  138  139 ]  these reactions should have a significant impact on ongoing in vivo infection . in vitro infection experiments additionally showed the negative impact of nets on host cell invasion since infection rates were significantly reduced when using pmn - preexposed c. parvum stages . 
 the fact that these reactions were entirely reversible via dnase i treatments rather argued against any cryptosporidicidal effects of nets . 
 the colocalization of ne  histones  and mpo with dna in parasite - mediated extracellular fibres proved classical characteristics of nets and inhibitor experiments emphasized the key role of ne  nox  and mpo in efficient net formation . in agreement with findings on eimeria - induced netosis  inhibition experiments revealed c. parvum - triggered net formation as dependent on intracellular ca release and erk 1/2 and p38 mapk - mediated signalling pathways . 
 interestingly  c. parvum sporozoite - exposed bovine pmn showed increased gene transcription of proinflammatory molecules  some of which were recently shown as potent net inducers ( e.g.  il-8 and tnf- ) [ 140  141 ] and may have potentiated net reactions . 
 infections with leishmania spp . represent a major health problem and according to the who   10% of the human world population is at risk of infection  meaning that approximately 12 million people in 98 countries are infected  and 2 million new cases occur each year [ 142  143 ] . 
 leishmaniasis is a vector - transmitted zoonosis caused by more than 25 different obligate intracellular protozoan leishmania species [ 142144 ] . 
 particularly pmn have been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of leishmaniasis [ 145149 ] and recent studies examined the potential role of nets during the early phase of the disease of different leishmania species . 
 .   showed for the first time that promastigotes of leishmania amazonensis  l. major  and l. chagasi were capable of triggering net formation . 
 additionally  leishmania - triggered netosis seems not entirely stage - specific  since both promastigotes ( l. amazonensis  l. major  l. chagasi  l. donovani  l. mexicana  and l brasiliensis ) and amastigotes ( l. amazonensis  l. braziliensis ) promoted net formation in vitro and in vivo [ 51  147  150152 ] . more importantly  guimares - costa et al . 
 provided first indications on possible parasite - specific ligands being responsible for leishmania - mediated netosis . 
 thus  leishmania - derived lipophosphoglycans ( lpg ) were suggested as the main trigger of net release since these molecules also induced nets in a purified form . 
 the former authors showed that nets possessed detrimental effects on parasites as net - entrapped l. amazonensis promastigotes exhibited decreased viability . 
 authors also demonstrated that the extracellular dna and histones found on nets were involved in the parasite inactivation / killing process . 
 the leishmanicidal effects of histones were proven in promastigotes cocultures with purified h2a histones leading to the killing of parasites and by a significant reduction of leishmanicidal effects when cocultured in the presence of anti - histone antibodies . 
 demonstrated that also the histone h2b could directly and efficiently kill promastigotes of l. amazonensis  l. major  l. braziliensis  and l. mexicana . in case of l. donovani  gabriel et al . 
 reported netosis as a ros - dependent process which was equally triggered in human and murine pmn ( see table 1 ) . 
 however  leishmania - lipophosphoglycan- ( lpg- ) dependent net induction reported by guimares - costa et al . 
 was not observed with l. donovani . when using genetically modified l. donovani promastigotes gabriel et al 
 nonetheless  in this infection system  lpg appeared to be involved in the resistance to nets - mediated killing  since the wild type of l. donovani maintained its viability in the presence of nets  whilst mutant parasites lacking lpg were efficiently killed by these extracellular structures . 
 a more recent study revealed that leishmania parasites trigger not only the classical ros - dependent netosis as previously demonstrated but also a ros - independent form  named as early / rapid vital netosis . during this early / rapid leishmania - triggered netosis  
 in which net formation takes place after 515  min of activation without affecting pmn viability [ 29  68 ]  the parasites are also being efficiently entrapped . regarding net - related evasion strategies of trypanosomatidae parasites  leishmania spp . 
 seem capable of evading net killing by firstly blocking the oxidative burst activity of pmn or even by resisting microbicidal activity of nets [ 145  150 ] . moreover  guimares - costa et al 
 .   showed that l. infantum promastigotes express the enzyme 3-nucleotidase / nuclease which was previously described to be involved in parasite nutrition and infection and was proven to be part of the ability of promastigotes to escape net - mediated killing . 
 a recent investigation has shown that a salivary component of the sand fly insect that transmits leishmaniasis may also play a role in the survival of leishmania in the definitive hosts  by modulating their innate immune system . 
 a molecule named lundep from the salivary gland of lutzomyia longipalpis was recently described as an endonuclease with net - destroying properties in humans . in the presence of lundep  
 measured the ne release from nets as an indicator of net destruction  since ne is normally decorating nets backbone structures and found at low concentrations in culture supernatants  as previously demonstrated . 
 lundep was responsible for the significant increase of ne concentration in the supernatants when compared to negative controls . 
 in conclusion  these experiments showed degradation of dna scaffold of nets  destroying their functional integrity  and increasing promastigote survival and exacerbating l. major infection . 
 approximately eight million people are affected by this tropical disease in the americas and an average of 12000 deaths per year is known to occur due to american trypanosomiasis . 
 it is well known that macrophages  eosinophils  monocytes  and pmn are implicated in the control of early infection [ 30  155 ] . 
 .   demonstrated in vitro that t. cruzi is able to trigger nets in a dose-  time-  and ros - dependent manner . in agreement with reports on eimeria spp . and b. besnoiti [ 23  24  59 ] but in contrast to observations on t. gondii and leishmania spp . 
 [ 25  51 ]  the viability of t. cruzi stages was not affected by nets  but netosis significantly impaired the parasite host cell infectivity . 
 in fact  nets components as ne may affect t. cruzi infectivity  since this enzyme appears to be involved in increased trypanocidal activity and in the reduction of trypomastigote release by prestimulated infected macrophages [ 30  156 ] . additionally  the authors showed via antibody - mediated blockage that t. cruzi - triggered netosis is a tlr2- and tlr4-dependent process . 
 moreover  the study showed that not only viable t. cruzi trypomastigote forms but also soluble antigens and killed t. cruzi parasites induced net release in human pmn . 
 in vivo murine studies indicated the relevance of netosis for the outcome of trypanosomiasis since significantly decreased parasites numbers were found in the blood system of those animals which had previously been infected with nets - pretreated parasites . 
 during the last years a vast amount of data on protozoan - mediated etosis was published strengthening the role of this effector mechanism in the defence of parasitic infections . 
 several in vivo data have now proven the existence and importance of this early host innate effector mechanism . 
 however  there is still a total lack of information on parasite - derived ligands triggering etosis . 
 taking into account that in most cases et formation is considered as a species- and stage - independent process  rather ubiquitary occurring molecules may represent parasite - derived target molecules of ets . 
 moreover  recent data revealed that other leukocytes such as monocytes  macrophages  basophils  mast cells  and eosinophils also perform etosis upon pathogen encounter . 
 furthermore  et - related research mainly focused on the leukocytes aptitude to impact the parasites life cycle  but not on the propensity of parasitic stages to develop counter mechanisms for ets avoidance . while a bunch of data is available on bacterial nucleases or other counter mechanisms  
 taken together  we call for more parasite - related studies in the exciting field of etosis .","

1) Abstract: Mononuclear phagocytes form extracellular traps (ETS) to combat microbial infections. Recent evidence shows that ETS play a crucial role in the innate immune response of both vertebrates and invertebrates. This review discusses the role of ETS in trapping and killing protozoan parasites.
2) Research and Discussion: ETS are released in response to protozoan parasites or their specific antigens, forming a sticky matrix of nuclear DNA, histones, and antimicrobial compounds. This process, known as etosis, is a controlled cell death mechanism utilized by phagocytes to fend off invasive pathogens.
3) Results and Conclusion: Protozoa-induced etosis is a widespread effector mechanism for both vertebrates and invertebrates. It hinders the parasites' successful reproduction and life cycle completion. Further research on the molecular mechanisms of etosis may offer new insights into strengthening our first line of defense against pathogens. "
"the national tb prevalence survey in eritrea was conducted from february through october 2005 ( 6 ) . in 40 selected villages  
 a census ( which included information about sex and age ) was taken of 875 persons in each village . 
 all persons > 15 years of age were asked to provide a morning and a spot sputum sample . 
 persons who had 2 positive sputum samples were informed about the test results and referred for treatment . 
 those who had 1 positive sputum sample were referred to a nearby healthcare facility for further smear examination . 
 if results of smear examination were negative  thoracic radiographs were taken and evaluated by 2 experienced radiologists . the case definition for a sputum smear  positive case was at least 2 sputum specimens positive for acid - fast bacilli by ziehl - neelsen staining and microscopy or at least 1 sputum specimen positive for acid - fast bacilli and radiographic abnormalities consistent with active pulmonary tb ( classification of the national tuberculosis control program in eritrea ) . 
 using the prevalence estimate obtained from the survey and 2 different models  we calculated the cdr for 2004 . in model 1  
 described by styblo  cdr = ( notification rate / prevalence rate ) / ( 0.5 + 0.83  [ notification rate / prevalence rate ] ) ( 78 ) . in model 2  described by dye et al . 
  cdr = ( notification rate / prevalence rate ) / ( [ notification rate / prevalence rate ] + 0.5 ) ( 910 ) . 
 we then compared the calculated cdr with the cdr estimated by the world health organization ( who ) to evaluate whether comparable conclusions about tb case detection would be obtained . 
 a total of 38047 persons were included in the prevalence survey . of those > 15 years of age  18152 ( 94.6% ) provided at least 1 sputum sample ( figure ) . 
 the prevalence of new smear - positive tb was estimated at 90/100000 ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] 35145/100000 ) in persons > 15 years of age . in 2005  44.7% of 
 the eritrean population was < 15 years of age ( 11 )  which resulted in an overall new smear - positive tb prevalence of 50/100000 ( 95% ci 1980/100000 ) under the assumption of no cases in persons < 15 years of age . 
 summary of tuberculosis prevalence survey in eritrea  2005 . in 2004  17/100000 new smear - positive cases were reported ( 2 ) . 
 for eritrea  the cdr provided by who is considerably lower than that calculated from the results of the national tb prevalence survey . both estimates indicate that eritrea has not reached the 70% target for case detection . however  the who estimate suggests that the program needs to improve case detection by a factor of 5  whereas the survey estimate suggests that case detection needs to be improved by a factor of 1.6 . 
 two explanations may account for the large difference : 1 ) the cdr derived from the tb prevalence survey is too high because of an underestimation of the prevalence of smear - positive tb  or 2 ) the cdr estimate published by who is too low because of an overestimation of the incidence of smear - positive tb . in the national tb prevalence survey  measures were taken to ensure high quality of the results ; e.g.  training of data collectors  repeat census taking  reexamination of all slides found positive on fluorescence microscopy  and reexamination of a 5% random sample of the negative slides . 
 persons who had smear - positive tb may have been missed because they did not provide a specimen ; however  because only 5% of eligible persons did not provide a specimen  this can explain only a slight underestimation . furthermore  recorded reasons for not providing a specimen seem to be unrelated to a higher chance of having tb . 
 the quality of the provided specimens may have been suboptimal because instructing and motivating persons to provide a sputum sample is challenging . for diagnosis of tb  microscopic examination of saliva 
 is less sensitive than examination of sputum ; however  in 50% of saliva samples from patients with a positive sputum sample  bacilli can be demonstrated ( 1213 ) . for 27647 samples that appeared to be saliva  smear 
 assuming that only 50% were detected  a maximum of 12 smear - positive tb patients may have been undetected . 
 taking this into account results in a prevalence of 87/100000 . using this estimate  model 1 provides a cdr of 30% and model 2 a cdr of 28% 
 the possibility that persons who provided a saliva sample were not able to produce a sputum sample because they did not have pathologic pulmonary changes should also be taken into consideration . 
 estimation of the incidence of smear - positive tb in eritrea is complicated by the fact that no data from tuberculin or prevalence surveys were available . 
 the only data available for eritrea were reporting data  which experts assessed as being of low quality ( 14 ) . 
 use of this limited information will result in an uncertain incidence estimate  which may result in an unreliable cdr . for most countries in africa  
 little information is available for estimating the prevalence of disease and progress towards the millennium development goals ( http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mi/mi_goals.asp  accessed 2006 aug 30 ) . on the basis of case reporting  
 tb was rightly declared an emergency by african health ministers at the who africa regional committee in maputo in 2005 ( 15 ) . to be able to fight this emergency  more reliable information about the prevalence of tb in africa is needed . 
 furthermore  for global tb control  reliable information about the tb epidemic in africa is needed because 28% of the incident smear - positive cases occurred in the who african region in 2004 ( 2 ) . in conclusion 
  the example of eritrea shows that a large gap may exist between available estimates of tb prevalence and actual tb prevalence in africa . 
 national tb prevalence surveys in africa would help provide better information on tb prevalence and case detection .","1) Abstract:
A national tuberculosis prevalence survey in Eritrea found a case detection rate (CDR) of 40%, compared to the published CDR of 14% by the World Health Organization. This suggests a significant gap in accurately detecting and reporting tuberculosis cases in the country.

2) Research and Discussion:
The study highlights the need for improved efforts in detecting and diagnosing tuberculosis in Eritrea. Factors such as lack of access to healthcare and inadequate resources may contribute to the low reported CDR. Future research could focus on identifying and addressing these barriers to improve tuberculosis control in the country.

3) Results and Conclusion:
The study reveals a significant disparity between the actual CDR and the published CDR in Eritrea. This highlights the need for improved surveillance and reporting systems for tuberculosis in the country. Addressing these issues could lead to better control and prevention of the disease, ultimately improving overall public health in Eritrea."
"spermatogenesis is a complex process of development that occurs in most mammals throughout adulthood period . 
 this process happens in seminiferous tubules  lined with epithelial tissue that contains sertoli cells . 
 sertoli cells are surrounded by a thin septum of peritubular cells that hold keep germ cells ( 1  2 ) . the spermatogonia undergo mitotic divisions  meiotic alternations  and morphologically transform to highly developed cells  spermatozoa  with a unique function and structure ( 3 ) . 
 such a complex process needs a unique program to control and regulate the involved genes . 
 this gene regulation is accomplished by cell surface molecules which participate in cell to cell and cell to extracellular matrix interactions ( 4  5 ) . on the other hand  
 when sperm is passing through the male and female genital tracts  it gains fertilization ability ( capacitation ) and adopts maturity characteristics . 
 maturity is initiated in the epididymis  where sperm communicates with the cell surface molecules of the pathway ( 6 ) . 
 therefore  the investigation of stage and/or cell - specific molecular expression in testis or post - testicular maturation system can improve our understanding of germ cell differentiation and sperm formation ( 7 ) . 
 first identified a 38kda protein ( mtex101 ) in adult mouse testis which is detectable on the surface of spermatocytes and spermatids in testis that it is absent on somatic cells  including sertoli or interstitial cells  like leydig cells ( 3 ) . 
 there is a temporary expression of mtex101 on oogonia  but the molecule disappears in the mature ovary . in embryonic testis  mtex101 is detected on the prosperm - atogonia ( 8) . upon puberty  mtex101 mrna is expressed in spermatocytes and in steps 1 - 9 spermatids during spermatogenesis  but not during spermatogonia . 
 the tex101 protein remains on the cell surfaces in steps 10 - 16 spermatids and testicular sperm  but hides from epididymal sperm after passing the caput epididymis ( 6 ) . 
 the expression of mtex101 homologous protein has been reported in a leukemia cell line and lung cancer in rats and humans  respectively ( 9  10 ) . 
 the exact structure and function of mtex101 is not completely understood yet  but it has been speculated that this protein is associated with several transmembrane proteins like ly6k 
 ( 11 ) and cellubrevin ( 12 ) that transduce the extra - cellular signals to the intracellular molecules . 
 the present study was undertaken to produce recombinant mtex101  which might pave the way for the production of specific antibodies for further structural and functional characterization of the molecule . 
 total rna was isolated from male gonadal organs ( four to 6 week - old mice from pasteur institute of iran ) . 
 rna concentration was measured by a biophotometer ( eppendorf  hamburg  germany ) at 260 nm . 
 one microgram of the total rna was reversetranscribed to cdna by using 200u of molony murine leukemia virus ( rtm - mulv ) reverse transcriptase enzyme ( fermentas  vilnius  lithuania )  and 20pmol of random hexamer primers ( cybergene  stockholm  sweden ) .

 the recombinant plasmids were isolated from confirmed colonies by miniperp kit ( qiagen ) and then digested by ecori and noti restriction enzymes . 
 plasmid dna ( 800ng ) was used in 25l of the total volume  including noti ( 15units )  ( invitrogen  carlsbad  ca  usa )  ecori ( 15 units )  ( invitrogen )  and 2.5l of 10 x reaction buffer 3 ( invitrogen ) and incubated for 1.5 hr at 37c . the mtex101 fragment in pgem - t 
 easy was extracted form agarose gel and then subcloned into a pet-28a ( + ) expression vector ( merck  darmstadt  germany ) and was digested by the same restriction enzymes above .

 ligation products were used for transformation of e. coli jm109 strain by heat shock method ( 17 ) . after a recovery time of 1 hour in lb broth  the transformed bacteria were cultured on lb agar and kanamycin ( 50g / ml ) ( sigma  usa ) containing plates for 16 hrs at 37c . 
 the obtained colonies were screened by colony pcr and one of them was confirmed by dna sequencing . 
 recombinant plasmid was purified and was then used for transformation of bl21 ( de3 )  which is a protease deficient strain of e. coli . 
 a single transformed colony was inoculated into 50ml of lb broth  including kanamycin ( 50g / ml ) ( sigma  usa ) and untransformed bl21 ( de3 ) bacteria were cultured into 50 ml of lb medium . 
 incubation was performed under shaking at 37c until the optical density ( od ) at 600 nm reached 0.6 . 
 iptg ( sigma ) was added to the remainder with the final concentration of 1 mm and incubation continued for 2 - 3 more hours . 
 cell lysates were prepared by sonication of pellets in pbs buffer including 1% protease inhibitor ( roche ) . 
 protein solutions were obtained from bacteria by boiling them in a sample buffer that contained tris - hcl ( ph=6.8  0.5 m )  sds ( 10% w / v )  glycerol ( 50% v / v )  and bromo phenol blue ( 0.5% w / v )  for 5min . 
 samples ( 50l of each ) were separated by sds - page ( 8% ) ( bio - rad  hercules  ca  usa ) under non - reducing conditions . 
 the protein constituents were then electro - phoretically blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) membrane ( millipore  billerica  ma  usa )  as described by towbin et al . 
 ( 
 the membrane was blocked in 5% skim milk / 0.1% tween 20 in pbs ( ph 7.4 )  and then the reactivity of the transferred protein(s ) with 1g / ml of anti mtex101 pab ( avicenna research institute  iran ) was assessed using sheep anti rabbit ig hrp ( avicenna research institute  iran ) .

 the researchers immunized female mice with 8-week old testis lysates and obtained 12 monoclonal antibody producing clones ( tes101 - 112 ) . 
 immunohisto - chemistry analyses revealed that only tes101 was able to recognize a novel testicular protein as determined by searching the expressed sequence tag ( est ) database ( 3 ) . all studies on mtex101 protein are performed solely by tes101 antibody and presently  no commercial antibodies are available to carry out research on this protein . in this study  we produced mtex101 recombinant protein that is useful for antibody development for further investigations . 
 mtex101 mrna contains 750 bases  which encodes 250 amino acids . after the removal of the putative 25-amino acid signal peptide at n - terminus 
 reported a 38kda band by western blot analysis under non - reducing conditions and no 24 kda band was observed ( 3 ) . 
 this large difference in the molecular mass was speculated to be due to glycosylation of the peptide and it was proved to be true by jin et al . 
 glycosylation is known as the prime cause of post - translational modifications ( ptm ) in proteins ( 16 ) . 
 the asn - x - ser / thr is the basic sequence for n - linked glycosylation  however  the secondary structure of the protein can affect the final addition . 
 no consensus sequence has been established for o - linked glycosylation yet ( 17 ) . 
 jin et al  found four putative sites for n - glyco - sylation and several possible sites for o - glyco - sylation in mtex101 amino acid sequence ( 15 ) . 
 in fact  mtex101 is a highly glycosylated protein and it has been clarified that most of the oligosaccharide chains on this peptide are n - linked carbohydrates ( 12 ) . de - n - glycosylation of mtex101 created an 20kda band which is close to or even smaller than estimated molecular weight of mtex101 amino acid backbone ( 15 )  confirming glycosylation as the cause for the higher mass of native mtex101 . 
 the cellular role of glycoprotein sugar components can be investigated via several methods  like protein production in a host lacking oligo - saccharide addition system  such as prokaryotes ( 18 ) . 
 we succeeded to produce mtex101 recombinant protein in a prokaryotic system  which may be useful in clarifying the role of sugar components in protein structures . 
 however  proteins which are produced by this method may vary in their structures and functions ( 19 ) . 
 western blot analysis showed that this protein had a molecular mass of approximately 27kda under non - reducing conditions that is concordant with the various post - translational modification processes in prokaryotic systems as compared to those in eukaryotes . 
 the size of the recombinant protein ( 27kda ) is in conformity with the backbone protein ( 24kda ) and a 3kda peptide derived from the digested vector by noti and ecori restriction enzymes . 
 in this study  we successfully cloned mtex101 into a his - tagged expression vector ( pet-28a(+ ) )  followed by an efficient production of the relevant recombinant protein . 
 this protein can be used in antibody production to find out the role of mtex101 in spermatogenesis  egg fertilization and further investigation about the critical role of glycosylation in the function of this protein .","

Abstract: 
Production of antibodies against specific testis germ cell proteins, such as murine testis specific recombinant protein 101 (mtex101), is crucial for understanding spermatogenesis and infertility. Using RNA extraction and cloning techniques, we successfully produced recombinant mtex101 protein for the development of antibodies.

Research and Discussion: 
Our study focused on producing mtex101 recombinant protein through RNA extraction and cloning techniques. This protein, potentially involved in signal transduction, was produced in a 27kDa form in E. coli. The use of mono and polyclonal antibodies against this protein could aid in studying spermatogenesis and potential cancer-testis antigen roles.

Results and Conclusion: 
Upon induction, we successfully produced recombinant 27kDa mtex101 protein using RNA extraction and cloning techniques. Western blot analysis showed the presence of the protein using anti-mtex101 antibodies. These results demonstrate the potential for further investigation and development of antibodies for studying spermatogenesis and cancer-testis antigens."
"most malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract ( figure 1 )  comprising the naso-  oro-  hypo-  and laryngopharynx  are squamous cell carcinomas . 
 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( hnsccs ) are the primary tumor type in head and neck cancer ( hnc )  characterized by local tumor aggressiveness  high rate of early recurrences  metastasis  and development of second primary tumors  which are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in hnscc ( details in [ 14 ] ) . more than 90% of hnc cases are induced by chronic exposure to carcinogens enclosed in all forms of tobacco  synergized by heavy alcohol consumptions and poor diet ( see [ 5  6 ] ) . 
 it is estimated that about 5%10% of suspicious lesions arising in the mucous membranes of the mouth  pharynx  and larynx undergo malignant transformation . 
 cure rates of early disease ( stage i and ii ) range between 70% and 80%  and chemoprevention strategies seem promising to control potentially malignant oral lesions ( reviewed in [ 13 ] ) . 
 however  long - term survival rates  especially for advanced hnc  have not improved significantly over the last decades . despite modern therapeutic strategies and sophisticated surgical management of the tumor  
 the estimated five - year survival rate for advanced disease ( 30%40% ) remains poor ( [ 13 ] and references therein ) . 
 currently  rational therapeutic strategies targeting growth factor receptors by specific antibodies or kinase inhibitors have gained increasing clinical relevance in particular for the treatment of locally advanced cancer with the intent of preserving speech and swallowing ( see [ 13 ] ) . 
 thus  developing new therapeutic strategies and defining novel target proteins for the treatment of advanced hnc is of particular importance . in this respect  
 nuclear receptors ( nrs ) are transcription factors implicated in cancer development and are recently attracting major interest as therapeutic targets ( see [ 7  8 ] ) . 
 as nrs modulate cell proliferation  apoptosis  invasion  and migration  clearly representing hallmarks of cancer cells  several highly successful cancer drugs target this receptor family [ 811 ] . since several nrs 
 have been shown to be expressed also in head and neck cancer cells  nrs are most likely also contributing to hnscc development and progression [ 12  13 ] . 
 nrs belong to a large superfamily of transcription factors and based on sequence comparison are currently classified into seven subfamilies ( table 1 ) . 
 these transcription factors are able to modulate transcription of a variety of target genes by several distinct mechanisms  including both transcriptional activation and repression [ 7  8  14  15 ] . 
 transcriptional regulation can either be ligand - dependent or -independent  genomic or nongenomic  allowing nrs to mediate gene repression or its release  gene activation  or gene trans - repression ( details in [ 7  8  16 ] ) . 
 in particular  the large group of so - called orphan nuclear receptors  for which natural ligands are still unknown  do not exist at all ( true orphans )  or have only recently been identified ( adopted orphans ) is adding additional complexity to the field ( table 1 ) ( [ 8  17 ]  and references within ) . 
 in contrast to cell surface growth factor receptors  such as the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr )  which activate genetic programs through complex intracellular signaling cascades  nrs are able to directly bind to specific dna - sequences  so - called hormone response elements ( hres ) . 
 thus  nrs are composed of an n - terminal regulatory domain ( activation function 1 = af1 )  followed by a dna - binding domain ( dbd )  a ligand - binding domain ( lbd )  and another c - terminal regulatory domain ( activation function 2 = af2 ) ( figure 2 ) [ 7  8 ] . despite their conserved structural organization  
 nevertheless  two major modes of nr action can be assigned  depending on their intracellular steady - state localization in the absence of ligands ( figure 3 ) . 
 one group of nrs is confined to the cytoplasm within multiprotein - complexes in the absence of ligand . upon ligand binding  they actively enter the nucleus and bind to hres as homo- or heterodimers ( figure 4  details in [ 7  8 ] ) . 
 other nrs already reside in the nucleus in a complex with corepressor proteins  while ligand binding triggers corepressor dissociation allowing the recruitment of coactivators [ 18  19 ] . 
 however  in order to fulfill multiple biological tasks minor to major deviations from these two modes of nr action exist [ 7  8 ] . 
 nrs are not only implicated in a broad spectrum of physiological processes but are associated with many human diseases including metabolic and cardiovascular disorders as well as cancer . beside their proven clinical relevance for hormone regulated malignancies  there is rather limited information on their pathophysiological role as well as their prognostic and therapeutic potential for head and neck cancer [ 7  8  12  2022 ] . 
 most studies were investigating members of two classes of the nr superfamily  the thyroid hormone receptor - like and the estrogen receptor - like receptors ( table 1 ) . 
 thus  we will focus on relevant members of these subfamilies  summarize their potential diagnostic / prognostic value  and discuss their therapeutic potential . 
 within the thyroid hormone receptor - like receptor subfamily  the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors ( ppars ) show the highest disease relevance for hnscc . to date  
 three isoforms of the ppar (   /  and  ) have been identified  all able to form heterodimers with retinoid x receptors ( rxrs ) ( see [ 23  24 ] ) . 
 ppars are expressed in different cell types and activate the transcription of several genes involved in a variety of biological processes  including lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity ( see [ 23  24 ] ) . 
 furthermore  a role in limiting inflammation has also been reported [ 24  25 ] . 
 as tumor cell metabolism and inflammation appear to be critical for tumorigenesis and clinical outcome  nrs may thus directly or / and indirectly modulate malignancies [ 26  27 ] . 
 as such  ppar is overexpressed in many epithelial malignancies [ 22  28  29 ] including oral squamous cell carcinoma . in the absence of ligand  ppars are complexed with corepressor proteins  thus acting as transcriptional repressors . 
 ligand binding induces conformational changes facilitating heterodimerization with rxr    thus leading to the attraction of transcriptional coactivators ( figures 3   and 4 ) ( see [ 19  24 ] ) . 
 natural and synthetic ligands for ppars include lipophilic molecules such as fatty acids and eicosanoids as well as thiazolidinedione ( tzd ) drugs and derivates thereof ( overview in [ 7  24  31 ] ) . 
 ppar ligands seem to exert their effects in a dosage - dependent manner  although the detailed mechanism is currently not yet resolved . 
 the postulated cancer modulating mechanisms are diverse  including effects on wnt signaling  inhibition of nfb    as well as the modulation of cell cycle regulators and pro- and antiapoptotic proteins  which have been linked with head and neck cancer ( see [ 4  23 ] ) 
 . clinical aspects of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors in hnsccin hnscc  overexpression on the protein level has been convincingly demonstrated for ppar and ppar [ 12  30  33 ] . 
 agonist binding to ppar can induce cell differentiation  growth arrest  and apoptosis of cancer cells . 
 additionally  such activating ppar ligands were shown to exert antiproliferative on human colon and breast cancers ( details in [ 23  24 ] ) and were also suggested as potential chemopreventive agents for oral carcinogenesis [ 12  35  36 ] . of note  
 since at least 1.6 million patients take antidiabetic drugs that function as ppar ligands  epidemiological data on their long - term effects on tumor prevention would therefore be of value to rationally design cancer chemoprevention trials . 
 paradoxically  not only ppar agonists are considered as potential therapeutic agents in cancer therapy but also antagonists were studied in this respect . 
 ppar inhibition was shown to induce apoptosis and anoikis and inhibit tumor cell invasion in squamous cell carcinomas . 
 moreover  the results of several studies indicated that the growth - inhibiting activity of ppar ligands in oscc may be ppar independent . 
 others showed that the observed effects were strongly dependent on ppar-expression [ 12  38 ] as well as on the type and concentration of the agonist . in the majority of oscc cases  
 ppar mrna could be detected by rt - pcr . by immunohistochemical analysis of primary tumors 
  ppar was often found in low - grade tumors  especially in tumor endothelium  and a favorable impact of ppar expression on relapse - free survival of the patients could be demonstrated . 
 the beneficial effects of ppar ligands on malignancies were tested in several clinical trials  but outcomes proved to be highly diverse . some trials revealed 40% partial response rates  whereas others could not show any significant beneficial effect [ 41  42 ] . 
 moreover  one may speculate that the tumor modulating effects of ppar ligands are mediated indirectly by affecting the tumor microenvironment  such as cancer - associated fibroblasts or tumor endothelial cells . 
 in fact  ppar ligands have been shown to affect endothelial cell proliferation and migration and hence to regulate angiogenesis . also hypoxia - induced 
 angiogenesis appears to be affected by ppar ligands in cancer therapy  even if the precise mechanisms still remain unclear . 
 as angiogenesis is a crucial aspect for tumor development  therapy resistance and metastasis and inhibition of angiogenesis may hence have contributed to the clinical benefit observed.in sum  ppar ligands appear to be of clinical benefit for the treatment of head and neck cancer  in particular for oscc . nevertheless  a more detailed molecular knowledge on ppar biology is clearly required . 
 increasing knowledge about the mode of action  specificity  and dosage - dependence of ppar agonistic and antagonistic ligands will hopefully allow a better modeling of ppar receptor function and thus lead to a more effective design of combinatorial application schemes for cancer treatment and cancer prevention in the future

 another group of thyroid hormone receptor - like receptors implicated in hnscc is the retinoid acid receptors ( rars ) . 
 rars are characterized by their activation via vitamin a derivatives . upon activation  rars are able to heterodimerize with retinoid x receptors ( rxr ) and to bind to specific hormone response elements ( hres )  thereby modulating transcription of target genes ( figures 3   and 4 ) [ 8  26  46 ] . to date  a variety of coactivator- and corepressor - proteins have been identified  allowing the fine - tuning of target gene transcription  ranging from repression to full activation . 
 however  the molecular details are just beginning to be uncovered [ 8  26  46 ] . 
 rar activation often leads to differentiation  cell - cycle arrest  or apoptosis  culminating in the inhibiting of tumor growth . 
 hence  its ligand retinoid acid ( ra ) or derivates thereof are currently tested as therapeutic agents in several cancer types ( table 2 ) . paradoxically  in some malignancies ra rather promotes cell survival  which may be due to the ability of ra to also activate ppars  and as a consequence expression of prosurvival genes is induced . 
 could also show that the channeling of ra between these two nuclear receptor heterodimers is mediated by the cytoplasmic ra transporters crabp2 and fabp5 and thus is strongly depending on the fabp5/crabp2 ratio . 
 thus  the channeling of ra to different receptor heterodimers appears to be crucial for the regulation of cell - proliferation  positively or negatively affecting tumor growth . 
 interestingly  both proteins were found differentially expressed in metastatic and hpv - associated hnscc  but their biological and clinical effects remain to be investigated [ 51  52 ] . 
 an additional way of biological regulation is epigenetic modulation playing an important role in cancer development ( reviewed in ) . 
 gene silencing caused by aberrant hypermethylation of cpg islands has not only been detected in promoter regions of several tumor suppressor genes  but several studies show hypermethylation of the rar promoter in colon  breast  and lung cancers [ 54  55 ] . in head and neck carcinogenesis  hypermethylation of the rar promoter 
 was found to be indeed associated with rar downregulation and hence appears to be biologically relevant . 
 clinical aspects of retinoid acid receptors in hnsccas outlined above  a rationale for the use of retinoids in chemoprevention and cancer therapy was provided experimentally by different cellular      and animal models . 
 moreover  this strategy was supported by epidemiological data as well as by clinical trial outcomes [ 26  5961 ] . 
 several clinical chemoprevention trials including patients with increased risk for developing cancer have shown that treatment with retinoids resulted in the suppression of precancerous lesions ( see [ 26  60 ] ) . also  certain retinoids inhibited the development of second primary tumors in patients who had been previously treated for an early - stage cancer but remained at high risk to relapse ( [ 26  60 ] and references within ) . 
 however  other studies using isotretinoin or other retinoids ( e.g.  retinyl palmitate ) did not observe any benefit in second primary tumor development  recurrence  or mortality of hnscc or lung cancer [ 26  62 ] . 
 current trials ( table 2 ) are therefore aiming to resolve these controversies by recruiting appropriate study populations as well as by the use of novel drugs and improved treatment protocols.reduced rar mrna levels have been observed not only in several malignant tumors ( [ 26  56 ] and references therein ) but also in premalignant oral lesions ( and references within ) . 
 thus  most of the studies demonstrating rar downregulation were based on in situ hybridization and could therefore only show a decrease in the amount of mrna . 
 were the first to demonstrate decreased expression of the rxr and rar// on protein level correlating with different stages of oscc development and progression . 
 the molecular mechanism leading to downregulation or loss of rar is poorly understood  but it was suggested that expression of rar could depend on the intracellular level of retinoids . 
 several studies demonstrated a decrease in the amount of rar during vitamin a deficiency as well as its upregulation by ra . 
 additionally  there is evidence that retinoic acid induces the expression of rar mrna in certain cell lines  but not in the malignant counterparts of these cells . 
 thus  transformed cells may have developed an aberrant response to retinoic acid due to the deregulated expression of coactivator / repressor proteins . 
 ralhan et al . found a significant association between the increase in rar mrna levels and clinical responses of premalignant oral lesions to isotretinoin [ 65  66 ] . 
 hence  rar indeed seems to contribute to the suppression of the premalignant phenotype and malignancy and may be causally linked to the clinical outcome in chemoprevention trials with retinoids [ 26  67 ] . 
 if so  rar may indeed serve as a useful diagnostic marker in retinoid trials ( table 2 ) for the prevention of oral carcinogenesis . 
 rar modulation by its agonist ligand all - trans retinoic acid ( atra ) represents a successful example of how targeting of an nr contributes to an impressive clinical benefit in liquid tumors ( and references therein ) . 
 lessons learned from these studies clearly show that the therapeutic benefit could be further enhanced by combining atra with chromatin modulating agents  such as histone deacetylase inhibitors . 
 nevertheless  the design of receptor specific drugs as well as an in depth understanding of the molecular regulation of rar biology is required in order to fully exploit its therapeutic benefit and minimize potential side - effects in the area of head and neck cancer [ 7  26 ] . 
 as outlined above  a rationale for the use of retinoids in chemoprevention and cancer therapy was provided experimentally by different cellular      and animal models . 
 moreover  this strategy was supported by epidemiological data as well as by clinical trial outcomes [ 26  5961 ] . several clinical chemoprevention trials including patients with increased risk for developing cancer have shown that treatment with retinoids resulted in the suppression of precancerous lesions ( see [ 26  60 ] ) . 
 also  certain retinoids inhibited the development of second primary tumors in patients who had been previously treated for an early - stage cancer but remained at high risk to relapse ( [ 26  60 ] and references within ) . 
 however  other studies using isotretinoin or other retinoids ( e.g.  retinyl palmitate ) did not observe any benefit in second primary tumor development  recurrence  or mortality of hnscc or lung cancer [ 26  62 ] . 
 current trials ( table 2 ) are therefore aiming to resolve these controversies by recruiting appropriate study populations as well as by the use of novel drugs and improved treatment protocols . 
 reduced rar mrna levels have been observed not only in several malignant tumors ( [ 26  56 ] and references therein ) but also in premalignant oral lesions ( and references within ) . unfortunately  until recently no antibodies convincingly detecting rar were available . 
 thus  most of the studies demonstrating rar downregulation were based on in situ hybridization and could therefore only show a decrease in the amount of mrna . 
 were the first to demonstrate decreased expression of the rxr and rar// on protein level correlating with different stages of oscc development and progression . 
 the molecular mechanism leading to downregulation or loss of rar is poorly understood  but it was suggested that expression of rar could depend on the intracellular level of retinoids . 
 several studies demonstrated a decrease in the amount of rar during vitamin a deficiency as well as its upregulation by ra . 
 additionally  there is evidence that retinoic acid induces the expression of rar mrna in certain cell lines  but not in the malignant counterparts of these cells . 
 thus  transformed cells may have developed an aberrant response to retinoic acid due to the deregulated expression of coactivator / repressor proteins . 
 found a significant association between the increase in rar mrna levels and clinical responses of premalignant oral lesions to isotretinoin [ 65  66 ] . 
 hence  rar indeed seems to contribute to the suppression of the premalignant phenotype and malignancy and may be causally linked to the clinical outcome in chemoprevention trials with retinoids [ 26  67 ] . 
 if so  rar may indeed serve as a useful diagnostic marker in retinoid trials ( table 2 ) for the prevention of oral carcinogenesis . 
 rar modulation by its agonist ligand all - trans retinoic acid ( atra ) represents a successful example of how targeting of an nr contributes to an impressive clinical benefit in liquid tumors ( and references therein ) . 
 lessons learned from these studies clearly show that the therapeutic benefit could be further enhanced by combining atra with chromatin modulating agents  such as histone deacetylase inhibitors . 
 nevertheless  the design of receptor specific drugs as well as an in depth understanding of the molecular regulation of rar biology is required in order to fully exploit its therapeutic benefit and minimize potential side - effects in the area of head and neck cancer [ 7  26 ] . 
 this subfamily is composed of the estrogen receptors ( er and er )  the estrogen - related receptor  and the 3-ketosteroid receptors .   besides the estrogen receptors themselves  many of the genes regulated by the er / estrogen - axis are critical for cell proliferation  inhibition of apoptosis  stimulation of invasion and metastasis  as well as for the promotion of angiogenesis ( see [ 10  11 ] and references within ) . since these processes clearly state hallmarks of cancer cells  it is well accepted that ers are implicated in various cancer types [ 9  21 ] . 
 sex hormone receptors are expressed not only in sexual organs but  amongst others  also in the vascular epithelium  the lung epithelium  and the larynx . 
 the expression of sex hormone receptors could also be demonstrated in hnscc by several studies [ 12  13 ] . 
 both er isoforms as well as the progesterone receptor ( pr ) were detectable in cancer cells of the oral cavity  the salivary gland  and in laryngeal / hypopharyngeal cancers  whereas the tumor stroma was mostly negative [ 12  13 ] . 
 expression of er inversely correlated with that of er in esophageal carcinoma  and a correlation of er levels with tumor dedifferentiation and staging was suggested [ 73  74 ] . 
 clinical aspects of estrogen receptors in hnsccconsidering the impressive benefit of endocrine therapy in breast cancer  targeting sex steroid hormone receptor as a potential therapeutic strategy is also discussed for hnscc [ 12  75 ] . 
 currently  two main strategies are pursued in endocrine therapy of er - positive tumors . 
 one is based on steroidal antiestrogens like tamoxifen  which bind to the er  block its function  and ultimately induce receptor degradation [ 8  11 ] . 
 the other is based on aromatase inhibitors and luteinizing hormone - releasing hormone agonists  which reduce the level of circulating estrogen  thereby inhibiting er activation by depriving the receptor of its ligand . 
 tamoxifen was already shown to inhibit proliferation and invasion of hnscc cell lines  resulting in apoptosis  which could be further enhanced upon combination with cisplatin [ 7678 ] . 
 thus  a therapeutic role of antiestrogens or aromatase inhibitors in the clinical management of hnscc is currently under investigation  and the results of just completed clinical trials ( table 2 ) are eagerly awaited.however  the precise molecular roles and impact of estrogen receptor - like receptors for the onset and/or progression of head and neck cancer remain to be clarified 
 . this knowledge will be required  in order to rationally decide whether to further investigate the potential of modern endocrine therapy also for this tumor entity .

 nrs are associated with head and neck cancer and hence seem to be at least partially amenable for prevention and/or treatment strategies . 
 so far  three nr groups have mainly been linked with hnscc  the retinoic acid and the peroxisome proliferator - activated and the estrogen receptors . 
 also  target genes activated by these nr subfamilies ( table 3 ) have been implicated as key elements in the molecular circuits involved in head and neck cancer development and progression . 
 reports on other members of the nr superfamiliy are rather scarce for this tumor entity  suggesting that they have not been investigated so far . taking the thyroid hormone receptor as an example  
 many studies on its relevance for various malignancies have been conducted  whereas its role in head and neck cancer  including even thyroid carcinomas  has not been analyzed in detail . 
 likewise  data on the cancer - related biological functions of orphan nrs are still missing for this tumor entity [ 7  8 ] . 
 cancer 's achilles ' heel   it may be conceivable to speculate that molecules present in diet  tobacco  or beetle nut might deregulate the cell 's metabolism by affecting nrs and as such contribute to head and neck carcinogenesis [ 27  80 ] . of note  the development of novel nr ligands with improved specificity and activity is currently intensively pursued in the area of metabolic diseases ( see [ 7  8  81 ] ) . 
 hence  an interdisciplinary exploitation of the existing knowledge of nr pharmacobiology may result in novel hnscc treatment approaches . in sum  keeping in mind the enormous success of nr targeting therapeutics in several malignancies  a systematic investigation of nr biology as well as of its clinical relevance is highly desirable also for head and neck cancer . 
 together with the outcomes of current clinical trials ( table 2 )  such improved knowledge will hopefully result in strategies with improved benefit for the patient .","

1) Abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas are a common and aggressive type of cancer, with high rates of recurrence and metastasis. Despite current treatments, survival rates remain stagnant, highlighting the need for new approaches. Nuclear receptors, known to play a role in cancer development, are being targeted in preclinical and clinical studies for head and neck cancer treatment. 

2) Research and Discussion: Uncontrolled changes in genetic programs are a key factor in cancer development. In this review, we will discuss how nuclear receptors, a type of transcription factor, have been linked to head and neck cancer. Their mode of action and potential prognostic/therapeutic relevance will be explored, along with current research targeting these receptors. 

3) Results and Conclusion: Despite advancements in treatment strategies, head and neck cancer survival rates have not significantly improved. This highlights the need for new treatment options, such as targeting nuclear receptors. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown promising results, making them a potential target for therapeutic intervention in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas."
"alcoholic liver disease ( ald ) represents a spectrum of clinical illness and morphological changes that range from fatty liver  hepatic inflammation  and necrosis ( alcoholic hepatitis ) to progressive fibrosis ( alcoholic cirrhosis ) . 
 many of the toxic effects of ethanol in the liver have been associated with its metabolism . 
 ethanol oxidation generates toxic products such as acetaldehyde  and reactive oxygen species result in oxidative stress that initiates apoptosis and cell injury [ 25 ] . 
 it is activated by endotoxin  cytokines  and oxidative stress . in unstimulated cells  
 nf-b is a heterodimeric complex that is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its interaction with ib family of inhibitors . 
 when these cells are stimulated  ib is phosphorylated with subsequent release of nf-b resulting in the translocation of nf-b from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it activates the expression of target genes [ 7  8 ] . 
 activation of nf-b increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that were key factors in ethanol - induced liver injury rats [ 912 ] . 
 peroxisome proliferators activated receptors gamma ( ppar ) is a family of ligand - activated nuclear transcriptional factor which regulates cell differentiation  apoptosis  lipid metabolism  and inflammation . more recently  decreased expression of ppar has been found in rats with alcoholic liver fibrosis . 
 these suggested that ppar may play an important role in the development of hepatocellular inflammation  necrosis  and fibrosis in rats with ethanol consumption . 
 curcumin ( diferuloylmethane )  an antiinflammatory and antioxidant compound  is isolated from the rhizomes of the plant curcuma longa   linn . 
 importantly  it has been showed that curcumin suppressed the activation of nf-b in ethanol - induced liver injury in rats . 
 activation of ppar by curcumin resulted in inhibition of nf-b trans activating activity and increased expression of ppar at both the transcriptional and translational levels in activated hepatic stellate cells ( hscs ) . 
 however  it is unclear whether curcumin had any effect in early stage of ethanol - induced liver injury . therefore  the present study determined the effect of curcumin on early stage of ethanol - induced liver inflammation and improved pathology in rats . 
 female sprague - dawley rats  weighing 180220 grams  purchased from the national laboratory animal center  mahidol university  salaya  nakorn pathom  were used . 
 the rats were kept in a controlled temperature room at 25  1c under standard conditions ( 12-hour day - night rhythm ) . 
 all rats were received well care in accordance with the ethical committee  faculty of medicine  chulalongkorn university  thailand . 
 curcumin in powder form ( cayman chemical company  usa ) is dissolved in 50% ethanol that freshly prepared for the experiment . 
 all rats were fed with the controlled diet which contained 35% of energy from fat  18% from protein  and 47% from carbohydrate for 4 weeks ad libitum . 
 group 1 ( control  n = 8) : rats were fed distilled water ( 2.0 ml ) orally via an intragastric tube once per day for 4 weeks . 
 group 2 ( ethanol  n = 8) : rats were fed 50% ethanol ( 7.5 g / kg bw a day ) orally via an intragastric tube twice a day for 4 weeks . 
 group 3 ( ethanol + curi  n = 6 ) : rats were fed curcumin ( 200 mg / kg bw ) dissolved in 50% ethanol ( 7.5 g / kg bw a day ) via intragastric tube twice a day for 4 weeks . 
 group 4 ( ethanol + curii  n = 7 ) : rats were fed curcumin ( 600 mg / kg bw ) dissolved in 50% ethanol ( 7.5 g / kg bw a day ) by using intragastric tube twice a day for 4 weeks . at the end of the study 
 three small pieces of livers were collected  frozen in liquid nitrogen  and stored at   80c for mda analysis  sod activity  and ppar protein expression . 
 the remaining of liver was fixed in 10% formalin solution to determine histopathology  nf-b activation  and hepatic apoptosis . 
 after the liver samples were fixed in 10% formalin solution at room temperature  they were processed by the standard method . 
 briefly  tissues were embedded in paraffin  sectioned at 5 m  and stained with hematoxylin - eosin  and then picked up on glass slides for light microscopy . 
 all fields in each section were examined for grading of steatosis and necroinflammation according to colantoni et al . 
 steatosis was scored as the percentage of parenchymal cells containing fat ( micro- or macrosteatosis ) :    0 = no parenchymal cells containing fat    1 =   < 20% of parenchymal cells containing fat    2 = 2039% of parenchymal cells containing fat    3 = 4050% of parenchymal cells containing fat  
 inflammation and necrosis were scored by the number of foci of inflammation and necrosis identified under low - power field of light microscope :     0 = no inflammation and necrosis    1 = 1 focus per low - power field of inflammation and necrosis    2 = 2 foci per low - power field of inflammation and necrosis    3 = 3 or more foci per low - power field of inflammation and necrosis . 
 mda was assayed by determining the rate of production of thiobarbituric acid - reactive components . 
 an aliquot of 0.2 ml was mixed with solution containing 20% acetic acid  0.8% thiobarbituric acid  and 8.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate  heated in water bath at 95c for 60 minutes . 
 the solution was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4 000 rpm  and the absorbance of the supernatant fraction was determined at a wavelength of 546 nm . 
 sod was determined using the method of winterbourn  in which the light - triggered release of superoxide radicals from riboflavin leads to the formation of a blue complex through reaction with nitroblue tetrazolium . 
 one gram of the liver was homogenized in 0.1 m phosphate buffer ph   7.4 on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 3 000 rpm at 4c for 15 minutes . 
 the supernatant fraction was incubated in solution containing 0.067 m phosphate buffer ph   7.8  0.1 m edta  1.5 mm nbt and 0.12 mm riboflavin for 10 minutes in an illuminated chamber with an 18 w fluorescent lamp . 
 absorbance was recorded at 560 nm  and sod activity was expressed as units / mg protein . 
 apoptosis was measured by the identification of apoptotic nuclei in sections of liver by fragment end labeling of dna ( apoptosis detection kit  chemicon  usa ) . in brief  
 the dna fragments were allowed to bind an antidigoxigenin antibody that was conjugated to a peroxidase . 
 diaminobenzidine ( dab ) was applied to develop dark brown color and then the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin . 
 the results were expressed as the number of positive stained cells per high - power field . 
 the liver sections were deparaffinized with xylene and ethanol for ten minutes . after water washing  sections retrieved the antigen ( nf-b p65  santa cruz  usa ) with citrate buffer ph   6.0 in microwave for thirteen minutes . 
 next  3%   h2o2 and 3% normal horse serum were performed on the slides to block endogenous peroxidase activity for five minutes and blocked nonspecific binding for twenty minutes  respectively . 
 then  the primary antibody used for nf-b p65  a polyclonal antibody against the p65 subunit  was applied at a dilution of 1:150 for one hour at room temperature and incubated with the secondary antibody for thirty minutes . 
 when the development of the color with dab was detected  the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin . under light microscopy  the positive stained cells presented dark brown in nucleus . 
 the results were expressed as the number of positive stained cells per high - power field . liver sample ( 0.1 g ) 
 was homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer for 30 minutes on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4c . 
 a 60 g of protein was applied to 10% sds - page gel  and the fractionated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane . 
 membrane was blocked in tbst containing 5% dry nonfat milk for 1 hour and then incubated with ppar monoclonal antibodies ( 1:400  santa cruz  usa ) overnight at 4c . 
 then washed three times and incubated with secondary antibody  goat antimouse igg horseradish peroxidase ( 1:4000  cayman  usa ) for 1 hour . 
 all data were presented as means and standard deviation ( sd ) . for comparison among all groups of animals  one way analysis of variance ( one - way anova ) and 
 the histologic appearance of the liver in the control group was normal ( figure 1(a ) ) . in the ethanol - treated group  the histologic features showed mild to moderate steatosis and mild necroinflammation ( figure 1(b ) ) . 
 rats treated with ethanol and curcumin 400 mg / kg bw a day improved the liver histopathology that showed only mild steatosis but not necroinflammation ( figure 1(c ) ) . the high dose of curcumin treatment ( 1200 mg / kg bw a day ) also improved the liver histopathology that showed mild steatosis and mild necroinflammation ( figure 1(d ) ) . the summary of steatosis and necroinflammation score were shown in table 1 . 
 the level of hepatic mda  a marker of lipid peroxidation  increased significantly in ethanol - treated group as compared with control group ( 3.42  1.36 versus 1.44  0.24 nmol / mg protein  p < .05 ) . 
 curcumin treatment ( 400 or 1200 mg / kg bw a day ) decreased the elevation of hepatic mda level significantly when compared with ethanol - treated group ( 1.43  0.14 versus 3.42  1.36 and 1.43  0.29 versus 3.42  1.36 nmol / mg protein  resp . ; 
 our results showed that the level of hepatic sod activity of the control group was 1081.36  145.01 units / mg protein  while that of the ethanol - treated group was 1135.86  209.48 units / mg protein . in rats treated with ethanol and curcumin ( 400 or 1200 mg / kg 
 bw a day )  the levels of hepatic sod activity were 966.28  139.44 and 967.84  116.66 units / mg protein  respectively . 
 the number of apoptotic nuclei in the liver of control group was very low ( 0.38  0.28 cells / high - power field ) . 
 in contrast  the numbers of apoptotic cells were observed frequently in centrilobular area in ethanol - treated group when compared with control group ( 2.43  2.68 versus 0.38  0.28 cells / high - power field  p < .05 ) ( figures 4   and 5 ) . there was a trend of decreased apoptosis in low dose of curcumin treatment  but the difference did not reach a statistical significance ( figure 4 ) . 
 the number of positive stained cells in the liver of ethanol - treated group was significantly higher than control group ( 1.08  0.52 versus 0.04  0.04 cells / high - power field  p < .05 ) . 
 in contrast  curcumin treatment ( 400 or 1200 mg / kg bw a day ) decreased the number of positive stained cells significantly when compared with ethanol - treated group ( 0.15  0.02 versus 1.08  0.52 and 0.17  0.09 versus 1.08  0.52 cells / high - power field  resp . ; 
 p < .05 ) ( figures 6   and 7 ) . in order to examine the change of ppar protein expression in early stage of ethanol - induced liver injury 
 the ppar protein expression in control group was 0.57  0.19  and ethanol group was 0.68  0.16 . rats treated with ethanol and curcumin ( 400 or 1200 mg / kg bw a day ) had 0.44  0.03 and 0.54  0.23  respectively . 
 these data did not show a significant change in ppar protein expression in the liver in all groups ( figure 8) . 
 ethanol oxidation generates toxic metabolites  free radicals ; and induces a state of oxidative stress which contributes to the pathogenesis of ald . 
 importantly  oxidation of ethanol through the cytochrome p450 2e1 ( cyp 2e1 ) generates superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide [ 2  21  22 ] . 
 these free radicals are capable of damaging many cellular components such as dna  protein  and lipid . 
 one of the characteristic features of oxidative stress is enhancement of lipid peroxidation . a number of studies 
 have been demonstrated that ethanol intake increased the formation of lipid peroxidation product  such as mda [ 2426 ] . 
 we found that an increase in hepatic mda level as well as pathological changes were observed in ethanol - treated group .   to counteract this oxidative stress  
 cells have a variety of antioxidant enzymes  including sod  catalase  and glutathione peroxidase . 
 the effects of chronic ethanol exposure on activity of sod are controversial  with reports of decrease or no changes [ 25  28 ] . 
 these studies may reflect variations in experimental design  diet  and duration of ethanol feeding . 
 decreased sod activity in ethanol fed rats was associated with enhancement of lipid peroxidation and severe pathology of liver . 
 therefore  the sod activity in liver did not change in early ethanol - induced liver injury . 
 oxidative stress can also initiate or amplify inflammation through upregulation of several genes involved in the inflammatory response . 
 one such gene is nf-b  whose activation results in the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines . 
 activation of nf-b and upregulation of cytokine production occurred in ethanol - induced liver injury and are associated with lipid peroxidation [ 9  10 ] . 
 evidence was presented that curcumin prevented ethanol - induced liver injury in rats by inhibiting the expression of nf-b - dependent genes . 
 although  a high dose of curcumin treatment ( 1200 mg / kg bw ) was not better than low dose ( 400 mg / kg bw )  the present study showed that curcumin improved ethanol - induced liver injury by reduction of oxidative stress and inhibition of nf-b activation . 
 ethanol - induced liver injury has been linked to oxidative stress caused by the production of reactive oxygen intermediates that cause mitochondrial dysfunction  leading to a release of proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c that can activate caspases and initiate the apoptotic cascade in hepatocytes . 
 jin and coworker observed the pathological changes and investigated the correlation of hepatocyte apoptosis with cyp2e1 expression and oxygen free radical in rats with ald . using the tunel assay  we detected a difference in apoptosis between the control and ethanol - treated group that was similar to human alcoholic hepatitis and experimental rat model of ald [ 3335 ] . 
 cells in centrilobular area are low o2 and nutrient supply thus the distribution of apoptotic cells is observed frequently in centrilobular area . in this study curcumin treatment 
 did not detect a difference in hepatocyte apoptosis ; however  this was a trend of decreased apoptosis in low does of curcumin treatment . 
 this stage showed severe liver injury and hsc activation . in normal liver  hscs undergo a process known as activation  which upregulate cytokines and growth factor . 
 for instance  platelet - derived growth factor is capable of inhibiting ppar expression via mitogen - activated protein kinase - mediated phosphorylation of ppar . 
 also  tnf-  inflammatory cytokine  is known to inhibit ppar expression in adipocytes and an early phase of hsc activation in liver fibrosis [ 38  39 ]  thus alcoholic liver fibrosis rats could decrease ppar expression . 
 our model showed only mild steatosis  necroinflammation  and no hsc activation ; therefore  no change of ppar protein expression was found in ethanol - treated group . 
 further studies should be determined roles of ppar in different stages of ald . in conclusion 
  our study demonstrated that curcumin  a representative phenolic antioxidant and antiinflammmation  could improve histopathology of liver in early stage of ethanol - induced liver injury by reduction of oxidative stress and inhibition of nf-b activation . 
 for hepatocyte apoptosis  curcumin treatment might have a trend of decreased apoptotic cells in ethanol - fed rats .","

Abstract: In this study, female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with ethanol or curcumin for 4 weeks to investigate the mechanism of curcumin in attenuating inflammation and liver pathology in early stage of alcoholic liver disease. Results showed that curcumin treatment improved liver histopathology by reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting NF-B activation. 

Research and Discussion: Female rats were divided into four groups and treated with different doses of curcumin and ethanol for 4 weeks. Results showed a decrease in liver pathology, MDA levels, and NF-B activation with curcumin treatment. No significant differences were found in SOD activity and PPAR protein expression among the groups. 

Results and Conclusion: Ethanol treatment showed mild-to-moderate steatosis and increased levels of MDA, hepatocyte apoptosis, and NF-B activation. However, curcumin treatment resulted in improved liver pathology and a decrease in MDA levels and NF-B activation. Further studies are needed to explore the potential of curcumin in treating early-stage alcoholic liver disease."
"this study provides class iii evidence that more patients are seizure - free and have stopped aed treatment in the long term after resective epilepsy surgery than nonoperated epilepsy patients . 
 in sweden  all epilepsy surgery procedures are reported to the snesur  which was initiated in 1990 . 
 an internal control system rejects certain impossible combinations of data and regular external quality controls are performed by an independent controller . 
 since 2005  the follow - up has been extended from 2 years to 5  10  and 15 years postoperatively . 
 snesur contains baseline information on patient 's epilepsy history  preoperative seizure types and syndromes  mean monthly seizure frequency during the year preceding the presurgical investigation  aeds  preoperative investigations  psychosocial data  surgical data ( type and location of surgery )  histopathologic diagnoses  and postoperative complications . 
 two - year follow - up data cover seizure situation  aeds  and psychosocial data . 
 the 5-  10-  and 15-year follow - ups are structured telephone interviews regarding seizure situation  aeds  psychosocial aspects  and driving . in this study  we analyzed seizure outcome and aed medication 5 and 10 years after resective epilepsy surgery in patients who had 5- and 10-year follow - ups in 2005 to 2007 ( and hence were operated on in 2000 to 2002 and 1995 to 1997 ) . 
 the cohort comprises the 327 patients who had resective surgery during these time periods . in 2005 to 2007  144/176 patients operated on in 1995 to 1997 ( 98/116 adults and 46/60 children 18 years ) had a 10-year follow - up  and 134/151 patients operated on in 2000 to 2002 ( 92/103 adults and 42/48 children 18 years ) had a 5-year follow - up . 
 seventeen patients were reoperated before long - term follow - up and there were 11 deaths . 
 twenty - one patients ( 6.4% ) were lost to follow - up ( for details  see figure e-1 on the neurology web site at www.neurology.org ) . as a control group  
 consecutive patients who underwent presurgical investigations during the same time periods but were not operated were identified at 3 of the 6 operating centers ( gteborg  uppsala  and lund ) . 
 eighty adults and 13 children out of 94 adults and 13 children underwent a cross - sectional long - term follow - up in 2008 after a mean of 9.3 years ( adults ) and 8.8 years ( children ) using the same structured telephone interview as for the surgical group . 
 thirteen adult patients had died ( 4 epilepsy - related deaths ) and 1 was lost to follow - up ( 1% ) . 
 reasons for not having surgery were nonconclusive workup ( n = 41 )  multifocality ( n = 27 )  patient declined surgery ( n = 12 )  seizure onset within eloquent cortex ( n = 11 )  and neuropsychological reasons ( n = 2 ) . 
 seizure freedom ( without or with aura  international league against epilepsy [ ilae ] class i and ii ) is reported for the year preceding the follow - up except for patients with sustained seizure freedom since surgery  which is separately reported . for patients with continuing seizures or seizure relapse 
 postoperatively  the mean monthly seizure frequency in the last year of follow - up is categorized as follows : 75% reduction in seizure frequency ; 50%74% reduction in seizure frequency ; 0%49% reduction in seizure frequency ; and increased seizure frequency . for comparison between 2 groups  
 fisher exact test was used for dichotomous variables  mann - whitney u test for continuous variables  and mantel - haenszel  test for ordered categorical variables . 
 logistic regression analysis was performed for each independent variable to predict seizure - free outcome . 
 a forward stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to select independent predictors to outcome . only univariate predictors attaining a p value of < 0.10

 table 1 shows baseline characteristics of the operated patients and the controls  children ( 18 years ) and adults . 
 the only adult who underwent hemispherectomy at age 20 was added to the pediatric hemispherectomy group . 
 none of the baseline characteristics differed between operated and nonoperated patients  except for number of previously tried aeds in adults ( p < 0.001 ) and iq in children ( p = 0.042 ) . 
 baseline data of operated patients and nonoperated controls there was no significant difference in seizure outcome between the operated patients who had follow - up after 5 years compared to 10 years . in order to enable comparison with the nonoperated group  who had a mean long - term follow - up of 9.1 years ( range 514 )  the results from 5- and 10-year follow - ups in the operated patients were merged ( figure 1 ) . 
 two - year and long - term ( mean follow - up time 7.6 years  range 510 ) seizure situation for patients after resective epilepsy surgery compared to long - term follow - up of nonoperated controls ( mean follow - up time 9.2 years  range 514 ) . 
 seizure - free patients include those with sustained seizure freedom with or without aura since surgery ( blue ) and patients seizure - free at least the last year before follow - up ( green ) . 
 overall  117 ( 62% ) of the operated adults were seizure - free at long - term follow - up compared to 11 ( 14% ) of the controls ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 fifty percent ( n = 93 ) of the operated adults had sustained seizure freedom at the 2-year and 41% ( n = 78 ) at the long - term follow - up . none of the controls was seizure - free for the whole time period . 
 for the children  44 ( 50% ) in the operated group were seizure - free the year before long - term follow - up  compared to 5 ( 38% ) in the control group ( not significant ) . 
 fifty - three percent ( n = 46 ) of the operated children had sustained seizure freedom since surgery at the 2-year and 44% ( n = 39 ) at the long - term follow - up  compared to none in the control group . for both adults and children  the proportion with sustained seizure freedom at long term was significantly higher compared to the nonoperated patients ( p < 0.0005 ) . 
 details on seizure outcome for the operated patients at 2  5  and 10 years after epilepsy surgery are shown in table e-1 . 
 eighty - seven percent of the adults as well as of the children who were seizure - free after 2 years were seizure - free at the 5- or 10-year follow - ups ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] 7794 and 8095  respectively ) . 
 seizure outcomes for adults and children after different resection types are illustrated in table 2 . 
 the most common resection type was tlr ( 81% in adults  43% in children ) followed by frontal lobe resection ( flr ) in adults ( 12% ) and multilobe resection in children ( 20% ) . in adults  
 the best long - term seizure outcome was after tlr ( 63% seizure - free  sustained seizure freedom since surgery in 44% ) . 
 in children the tlr outcome ( 60% seizure - free  55% with sustained seizure freedom ) was matched by the long - term hemispherectomy results ( 60% seizure - free  all with sustained seizure freedom ) . 
 if the extratemporal procedures are summed up  31% of adults had sustained seizure freedom at long - term follow - up  compared to 36% of the children . 
 seizure outcomes in the long term related to resection type the main histopathologic diagnoses were categorized as follows : hippocampal sclerosis ( hs  n = 45 )  neurodevelopmental tumors ( n = 34 )  low - grade astrocytomas ( n = 21 )  cavernous hemangiomas ( n = 21 )  malformations of cortical development ( n = 52 )  gliosis ( n = 65 )  and other ( n = 40 ) . 
 highest seizure freedom rates were seen in hs ( 60%  47% sustained since surgery ) and epileptogenic lesions ( 72%  57% sustained since surgery ) ( table e-2 ) . the univariate relationship between long - term seizure freedom and the following baseline variables 
 was explored for both operated patients and controls : epilepsy duration in percent of life length ( relative epilepsy duration  in odds ratio [ or ] increment units of 10% )  30 seizures / month  and presence of secondarily generalized tonic - clonic seizures ( sgtcs ) . for the operated patients  additional variables were positive mri  resection types  and histopathology ( figure 2 ) . for the controls  
 the univariate associations were nonsignificant although in the same direction as for the operated patients ( relative epilepsy duration  or 0.89 [ 95% ci 0.731.09 ]  30 seizures / month  or 0.88 [ 95% ci 0.223.47 ]  and sgtcs  or 0.56 [ 95% ci 0.181.68 ] ) . in the surgical group  
 multivariate analysis was performed  where 30 seizures / month  or 0.40 ( 95% ci 0.230.69 )  and relative epilepsy duration  or 0.91 ( 95% ci 0.831.00 )  were negative predictors  while positive mri  or 1.96 ( 95% ci 1.083.55 )  was a positive predictor of seizure - free long - term outcome . 
 the auc value ( goodness of fit ) for the final multiple model was 0.66 . for the categorical variables with more than 2 categories ( resection type and histopathology )

 none of the baseline characteristics differed between operated and nonoperated patients  except for number of previously tried aeds in adults ( p < 0.001 ) and iq in children ( p = 0.042 ) . 
 there was no significant difference in seizure outcome between the operated patients who had follow - up after 5 years compared to 10 years . in order to enable comparison with the nonoperated group  who had a mean long - term follow - up of 9.1 years ( range 514 )  the results from 5- and 10-year follow - ups in the operated patients were merged ( figure 1 ) .

 seizure outcomes for adults and children after different resection types are illustrated in table 2 . 
 the most common resection type was tlr ( 81% in adults  43% in children ) followed by frontal lobe resection ( flr ) in adults ( 12% ) and multilobe resection in children ( 20% ) . in adults  
 the best long - term seizure outcome was after tlr ( 63% seizure - free  sustained seizure freedom since surgery in 44% ) .

 seizure outcomes in the long term related to resection type the main histopathologic diagnoses were categorized as follows : hippocampal sclerosis ( hs  n = 45 )  neurodevelopmental tumors ( n = 34 )  low - grade astrocytomas ( n = 21 )  cavernous hemangiomas ( n = 21 )  malformations of cortical development ( n = 52 )  gliosis ( n = 65 )  and other ( n = 40 ) . 
 highest seizure freedom rates were seen in hs ( 60%  47% sustained since surgery ) and epileptogenic lesions ( 72%  57% sustained since surgery ) ( table e-2 ) .

 the auc value ( goodness of fit ) for the final multiple model was 0.66 .

 at baseline  183 ( 66% ) of the patients had 2 aeds  85 ( 31% ) had 1 aed  and 8 ( 3% ) had no aeds . 
 the number of aeds used by the operated seizure - free patients decreased over time ( figure 3 ) .

 more children than adults had stopped aeds ( 86% of the children and 43% of the adults  p = 0.002 ) . 
 there was no significant association between the proportion of seizure - free patients who stopped aeds and resection type . among patients with seizures  the proportion with 2 aeds had increased from 77% preoperatively to 82% 10 years after surgery . 
 number of antiepileptic drugs at the start of preoperative investigations  and after 2  5  and 10 years for patients who were seizure - free at 5- or 10-year follow - up . 
 since long - term results of epilepsy surgery can not be obtained from rcts  observational studies with defined quality criteria are needed . a number of requirements for studies on the prognosis after epilepsy surgery have been suggested . 
 studies based on snesur meet many of these requirements  with a prospective design  representative study populations  a standard protocol for outcome measures  and prolonged longitudinal follow - up with few patients lost to follow - up . 
 we found 63% of adults and 60% of children to be seizure - free after tlr at the long - term follow - up and most had continuous seizure freedom since surgery ( adults 41%  children 44% ) . as expected  the results were not as good after flr  with 44% of adults seizure - free ( sustained in 35% )  and in children 27% seizure - free ( all sustained ) . 
 this is still substantially better than for the patients who could not be operated ( 14% seizure - free adults  none sustained and 38% seizure - free children  none sustained ) . 
 the adults who underwent other types of resections ( posterior or multilobar ) were few  and only 3 had sustained long - term seizure freedom . 
 children who had undergone posterior resections or hemispherectomies had long - term seizure freedom in 55% and 60%  respectively ( sustained in 46% vs 60% ) . 
 long - term outcome after resective epilepsy surgery is often reported cross - sectionally . in a meta - analysis from 2005 
 based on 78 studies  66% of tlr patients  46% of parietal or occipital lobe resection patients  and 27% of flr patients were seizure - free at follow - up 5 years postsurgery  but the authors point out that few studies reported sustained seizure freedom from surgery . 
 a number of recent longitudinal long - term outcome studies report sustained seizure freedom after tlr . 
 sustained seizure freedom is reported as engel 1  engel 1a  or engel 1a+b and in a few studies as ilae class i and ii . sustained seizure freedom around 
 5 years postoperatively varies between 46% and 55% and 60% to 80% . among the studies with moderate rates of sustained seizure freedom  2 of 4 are prospective  and our prospective study with 41% sustained seizure freedom at long - term follow - up after tlr in adults and 44% in children supports these results . 
 a number of studies report cross - sectional long - term follow - up of pediatric epilepsy surgery  with seizure freedom in 50% to 82% of patients 5 to 12 years after tlr . 
 only one study is longitudinal and reports sustained seizure freedom ( engel 1 ) in 54% of patients 5 years after tlr . 
 there are few retrospective reports of long - term outcomes in patients after flr or other extratemporal resections 
 . sustained seizure freedom 5 years after surgery varies in these studies from 15% and 27% to 52%  which can be compared to 31% ( adults ) vs 36% ( children ) in our cohort of 86 patients with varying extratemporal resections . 
 long - term reports from population - based cohorts are sparse . in a retrospective cross - sectional comprehensive audit from ireland  national long - term seizure outcome data were reported . 
 forty - four percent of patients were seizure - free 10 years after resective surgery  but the total number of operated patients could not be accounted for . a recent norwegian retrospective questionnaire study in children with 
 a response rate of 70% reported 58% seizure - free after a mean of 7 years . 
 however  sustained seizure freedom was not reported in these studies . in a recent systematic review  
 20 studies comparing surgical results to those of a nonsurgical control group were identified ; 13 had a follow - up of at least 4 years . 
 the controls were in general patients evaluated for surgery who for various reasons were not operated . 
 overall 44% of surgical patients were seizure - free at follow - up ( in 90% of the studies  seizure freedom was reported at last follow - up or last year ) compared to 12% of medically treated patients . 
 this is well in line with our findings of 58% seizure - free at last year of follow - up in the surgical group and 17% in the nonsurgical group  children and adults together . 
 it must be remembered that patients who after preoperative investigations are considered ineligible for epilepsy surgery are not comparable to surgically treated patients  and they may have another disease course . 
 it is difficult though to identify other reasonable controls for long - term follow - up studies  and from a clinical point of view they match the operated patients in many baseline variables . 
 predictors for seizure freedom in the long term ( 4 years ) have been sought by several investigators . while some found no remaining predictors in multivariate analysis  the most commonly identified predictors are sgtcs at baseline and epilepsy duration or age at surgery . 
 we found high baseline seizure frequency and relative epilepsy duration to be negatively and positive mri to be positively related with long - term seizure freedom . 
 epilepsy duration before undertaking presurgical investigation  has repeatedly been shown not to have shortened significantly over the years . 
 these results from long - term outcome studies underline the importance of earlier identification of good candidates for resective epilepsy surgery . 
 there is no common swedish protocol for discontinuation of aeds in seizure - free patients . 
 most adults continue aeds the first 2 postoperative years ; further decisions about withdrawal are taken individually . 
 we found that 43% of seizure - free adults and as many as 86% of seizure - free children had discontinued aeds after 10 years . 
 the reasons for this difference are unknown ; possibly  social consequences of seizure relapse are of greater importance to adults ( e.g.  driving or occupation )  who therefore may choose to continue aeds . 
 by contrast  more concern about adverse effects of aeds on the developing brain in children may lead to earlier decisions about withdrawal . 
 the proportion of seizure - free adults and children in whom aeds have been withdrawn after successful epilepsy surgery varies widely across studies . in a meta - analysis from 2007  9 studies were identified and a pooled analysis showed that 27% of seizure - free children and 19% of seizure - free adults had discontinued aeds at a mean follow - up of 7 years . however  in an indian study  aed withdrawal was systematically planned for all seizure - free patients after tlr and was successful in 63% of 258 patients who were followed for 5 years . very similar to our results in children  a canadian study found that 82% of seizure - free children had stopped aeds 10 years after surgery . 
 possible reasons for these differences in patient decisions about aed cessation may include socioeconomic and cultural differences  as well as how doctors inform their patients  which partly depends on their own assessment of recurrence risk . 
 the timetostop study showed that early withdrawal of aed in children did not influence the long - term seizure outcome but could unmask incomplete surgical success sooner  and the authors suggest that it is now time to plan an rct of aed withdrawal after epilepsy surgery in children . 
 like most  if not all  observational outcome studies after epilepsy surgery  we had no masking in seizure outcome assessment . 
 our nonoperated control group was recruited from the 3 largest of the swedish epilepsy surgery centers and is hence not a national sample . on the other hand 
  we have a regional referral system and it is reasonable to assume that this sample is representative of the population of patients who are evaluated for surgery in sweden but not operated . patients need detailed counseling before deciding to undergo irrevocable brain surgery . 
 realistic expectations concerning long - term outcomes are part of the information they need to consider . 
 this prospective population - based study contributes to this knowledge and supports seizure outcome data from prospective single - center studies  and also shows that a greater proportion of seizure - free patients than in most studies had stopped aed treatment 10 years after surgery .

Abstract:
This population-based, prospective study investigates the long-term outcomes of resective epilepsy surgery in Sweden. Follow-ups for 10 and 5 years were conducted for patients who underwent surgery and a control group. Results showed that a majority of operated patients were seizure-free, and many of them successfully discontinued antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

Research and Discussion:
The study found that 62% of operated adults and 50% of operated children were seizure-free after a mean follow-up of 7.6 years, compared to only 14% of non-operated adults. In addition, 41% of operated adults and 44% of operated children had sustained seizure freedom since surgery, compared to none of the controls. Factors such as high seizure frequency and long epilepsy duration were found to be negative predictors, while a positive MRI predicted a successful seizure-free outcome.

Results and Conclusion:
After 10 years, 86% of seizure-free children and 43% of seizure-free adults were able to discontinue AEDs, compared to none of the controls. This prospective study provides Class III evidence that resective epilepsy surgery can lead to better long-term outcomes compared to non-operated patients. The majority of patients who achieve seizure freedom after surgery maintain it, and children have a higher success rate at discontinuing AEDs compared to adults."
"the prevalence of obesity among adolescents in the united states has increased dramatically in the past 30 years  with particularly high rates among hispanic  african american  and native american youth [ 14 ] . 
 currently 33.6% of all adolescents 1219 years of age in the united states are either overweight or obese . 
 although the causes of obesity are complex  it is widely recognized that poor nutrition and physical inactivity play important roles . 
 for this reason  public health interventions targeting youths frequently focus on health promotion programs in schools [ 69 ]  as well as calling for nutrition and exercise counseling in the health care setting [ 1012 ] . 
 the potential for physicians to influence behavioral changes among patients through simple nutrition and exercise advice  as opposed to more time - intensive counseling is crucial . 
 some studies have documented the value of physician - counseling either used as a stand - alone strategy   or as part of a coordinated effort to help patients make changes in their diet and physical activity patterns . 
 national health organizations have also recognized the importance of clinician counseling and have called for an increase in the provision of both nutrition and exercise counseling given to adolescents during physician visits [ 15  16 ] . 
 the surgeon general 's recent vision for a healthy and fit nation ( 2010 ) encourages clinicians to recommend healthy eating and increased physical activity to their patients and recommends training for clinicians and health care students on effective ways to counsel patients on lifestyle behavior change .   in california  where adolescent overweight and obesity rates are comparable to national levels  major programmatic and policy responses aimed at obesity prevention in adolescents have been undertaken at schools to limit nonnutritious foods and beverages sold on campus and in communities to increase access to nutritious foods and safer places to exercise [ 8  9  19 ] . 
 however  little is known about the frequency of weight - related counseling given to different racial / ethnic groups or those with limited access to care  over the course of treating or preventing obesity in the health care environment . 
 a recent study   found that race was an important factor that explained the prevalence of nutrition or physical activity counseling among california adolescents : african americans compared to whites were more likely to receive nutrition counseling  while hispanics compared to whites were more likely to receive both nutrition and physical activity counseling . with regards to insurance type 
  data suggests that california adolescents who are uninsured or who qualify for low - cost / free insurance are at greatest risk for overweight or obesity  yet a recent national study found that adolescents with private insurance generally receive more counseling  compared to those who have low - cost insurance . 
 changes in the frequency of obesity - related counseling overtime by race / ethnicity or insurance type are yet to be examined . 
 previous research in california suggests that physician obesity - related counseling has been declining  with overall counseling rates between 2003 and 2007  shifting from 75% to 59% for nutrition and 74% to 60% for physical activity . 
 insufficient time  lack of resources  inadequate reimbursement  and patient noncompliance are typically cited as barriers to provision of routine advice by health care practitioners . 
 the objectives of this current study were to document trends from 2003 to 2009 in either nutrition or exercise counseling or a combination of both among california adolescents by race / ethnicity and by insurance type . 
 these findings can provide guidance for policies and programs in a state with high rates of adolescent overweight or obesity and large ethnic populations at particular risk . 
 further  we hypothesized that physicians would favor dietary counseling over exercise counseling when providing counseling . in an earlier study  
 stafford et al .   found that physicians offered dietary counseling to obese patients 41.5% of the time  while exercise counseling was offered only 32.8% of the time . among healthy weight participants  branner and colleagues found higher rates of nutrition compared with exercise counseling among children and adolescents ( 42.1% and 26.1%  resp . ) . 
 data demonstrating trends in nutrition and exercise counseling by race / ethnicity and by insurance type were obtained using four biennial california health interview surveys ( 20032009 )  the largest state surveys in the united states . the california health interview survey ( chis ) 
 is a two stage sampling  weighted  random digital dialing telephone survey  representative of the california noninstitutionalized population . within households  
 an adult and adolescent were randomly selected and interviewed by trained chis interviewers ; adolescents were directly interviewed . 
 the chis program obtained informed consent from all individuals participating in the survey and this current study was deemed exempt or waived for human subjects review by the university of california  berkeley  institutional review board . 
 in this study  obesity - related counseling refers to simple advice about nutrition and/or exercise practices  as opposed to more time - intensive counseling . 
 adolescents self - reported whether they discussed nutrition or exercise habits with their physician at their last routine exam :  when you had your last routine physical exam  did you and a doctor talk about nutrition or healthy eating ?  and  when you had your last routine physical exam  did you and a doctor talk about exercise or physical activity ? 
 data were analyzed using stata version 10  with the  svy  module to account for weighting and the raking method in variance estimation . 
 obesity - related counseling proportions are presented graphically by race / ethnicity and by insurance type for the period 20032009 . to better represent the obesity - related counseling construct 
  we categorized this variable as respondents having no discussions of nutrition or exercise with their physician  discussing either nutrition or exercise  or discussing both nutrition and exercise with their physician . participants ' self - reported their weight and height  which were used to generate the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) bmi age and gender specific percentiles  categorized into underweight ( < 5th percentile )  normal weight ( 5th<85th percentile )  overweight ( 85th<95th percentile )  and obese ( 95th percentile ) . 
 in addition  insurance type variables ( uninsured  medicaid  healthy families  employer - based  privately owned insurance  and other public insurance ) were collapsed into the categories ( uninsured  low - cost / free  employer - based  and private insurance ) . 
 medicaid is the united states health insurance program for certain low - income individuals and families  which is jointly funded by state and federal governments  while healthy families is a low - cost health insurance program for children and adolescents who do not have health insurance and who do not qualify for medicaid . 
 table 1 presents the study sample characteristics  using the chis ( 2009 ) . 
 participants ranged in age from 12 to 17 years  with 51.0% being male and 49.0% being female . 
 the sample consisted primarily of hispanics ( 49.3% ) and non - hispanic whites ( 33.5% ) . 
 most adolescents had some form of health insurance  with almost 60% being covered through their parents'/guardians ' employer - sponsored health insurance . 
 less than half of all adolescents ( 44.8% ) were at or above 300% of the federal poverty level . 
 based on self - reported data  28.7% of california adolescents were either overweight or obese  while 48.2% of all california adolescents received counseling on both nutrition and exercise subjects ( table 1 ) . 
 the majority of respondents ( 84.7% ) reported having a physical exam within the past year ( table 1 ) . 
 previously published data indicate how california adolescent demographics have changed from 2003 to 2007 . 
 figure 1 and table 2 present data for obesity - related counseling stratified by race / ethnicity . when examining nutrition or exercise counseling separately for the period from 2003 to 2009  african americans generally reported higher levels of nutrition than exercise counseling  while whites generally reported higher levels of exercise than nutrition counseling . 
 hispanics generally reported higher levels of nutrition than exercise counseling during 20032005  after which counseling levels remained consistent . 
 overall  trends show that counseling declined between 2003 and 2009 for all groups  except for hispanics and whites which started to increase again after 2007 ; american indians / alaska natives reported a sharp decline in 2009 . between 2003 and 2009  the proportion of adolescents who reported counseling on both nutrition and exercise decreased from 66.8% to 53.7% among hispanics ; from 60.7% to 15.1% among american indians / alaska natives ; from 61.7% to 33.4% among asians ; from 58.8% to 42.9% among african americans ; and from 60.0% to 46.2% among whites ( figure 1 ) . 
 figure 2 and table 3 present data for obesity - related counseling stratified by insurance type . 
 those who had private insurance generally received exercise counseling more frequently than nutrition counseling over the study time period . 
 there appeared to be no imbalance in frequency of nutrition or exercise counseling for the uninsured  low - cost / free or employer - based groups  except in 2003 when adolescents who were underinsured or had low - cost insurance reported more nutrition than physical activity counseling . 
 counseling appeared to decline from 20032009 among all insurance types  although after 2007  a slight increase was observed for the low - cost / free insurance group . among those who were uninsured counseling declined from 70.8% to 42.2% ; among the low - cost / free group  counseling declined from 64% to 53.4% ; among the employer group  counseling declined from 61.8% to 46.6% and among the private insurance group  counseling declined from 58.9% to 39.8% ( figure 2 ) . 
 as early as the 1950s  the american medical association council on food and nutrition cited the benefits of nutrition counseling  as well as inadequacies in nutrition education in u.s . medical schools . 
 further  counseling has been shown to be valuable in helping patients to change their behavior and to achieve weight loss and can be even more beneficial if used as part of a coordinated approach with health education materials . 
 kreuter and colleagues reported that patients who received a combination of health education materials  followed by physician counseling were 51% more likely to increase their leisure time physical activity  and 35% more likely to reduce fat from dairy sources at follow - up . 
 some groups that need obesity prevention counseling the most may still be missing out  including american indians / alaska natives  african americans  and the uninsured . 
 time trend findings from 2003 to 2009 indicate that nutrition and exercise counseling decreased for all racial / ethnic groups except for hispanics and whites  for whom it started to increase after 2007 . 
 our findings also suggest that counseling levels in california for racial / ethnic groups and for patients with different types of insurance are generally higher compared to national levels . 
 the higher counseling levels reported in this study  compared with national figures  may have been due to fewer barriers or more public health awareness of the obesity epidemic in california and stronger health care leadership . 
 previously reported barriers to counseling include insufficient reimbursement rates  lack of time  lack of training for medical providers in policy advocacy related to improved nutrition and activity environments  and the need for information on evidence - based obesity - related messages and referral networks for nutrition counseling . 
 when examining nutrition or exercise counseling separately during the study period ( 20032009 )  interesting differences were found by race / ethnicity : hispanic and african american chis adolescents generally reported higher levels of nutrition than exercise counseling  while whites generally reported higher levels of exercise  than nutrition counseling . 
 meanwhile  participants who had private insurance generally received more exercise than nutrition counseling during the study period . 
 further research is needed to investigate the underlying factors that may explain the differences in the findings for racial / ethnic groups . 
 the chis surveys were only able to identify the existence of discussions or conversations that adolescents may have had with their physicians regarding nutrition and exercise messages  but were not able to ascertain the depth of these discussions . given the limited time physicians have in working with patients  it is unlikely that any advice given would be in - depth psychological advice . 
 further  it is difficult to ascertain whether these conversations were initiated by the physician or the patient . 
 these data were unable to measure specific evidence - based obesity - related messages ( limiting sugar sweetened beverages  increasing fruit and vegetables  reducing television viewing  and increasing moderate - to - vigorous physical activity ) [ 7  29 ] . 
 the potential for recall bias also exists since adolescents were asked to self - report nutrition and/or exercise data that occurred during their last physical exam  however  most adolescents ( 84.7% ) had a physical exam at their physician visit within the past year . 
 this is the first study to examine trends in obesity - related counseling by race / ethnicity and by insurance type among california adolescents . 
 additionally  this is one of the first studies to examine trends in counseling among american indians / alaska natives  a group that is also disproportionately affected by overweight and obesity [ 3  4 ] . 
 the findings from our study have demonstrated that the downward trend in obesity prevention counseling in california among racial / ethnic groups and health insurance groups has changed course and has begun to increase . 
 future analysis of the biennial chis surveys will indicate if the trend continues in this direction . 
 it is widely accepted that obesity prevention should follow a socioecological approach  combining multiple interventions tailored to specific demographic groups . 
 while a vast amount of work has already been conducted in california to implement population - wide obesity prevention policies in schools   and in low - income communities  this momentum must also be applied to california primary health care settings . however  for physician - based counseling to continue to increase among the general adolescent population and among vulnerable high - risk groups in particular  this will require institutional and policy changes . 
 research on effective ways to support clinicians ' use of the aforementioned evidence - based obesity - related messages is still in its infancy  although preliminary data from clinic - based obesity interventions have begun to show promising results . 
 at least one us state ( washington ) has adopted clinic - based programs to address the childhood obesity epidemic by establishing partnerships with hospitals  health care plans  and community - based organizations . other states may consider adopting such a program in the primary care setting in order to build on obesity prevention programs and policies previously implemented in schools and low - income communities .","


1) Abstract: This study analyzed trends in nutrition and exercise counseling by race/ethnicity and insurance type among 12-17 year olds in California from 2003-2009. Results showed declines in counseling overall, but increases for Hispanics and whites after 2007. 

2) Research and Discussion: Findings suggest a need for counseling for all racial/ethnic groups and insurance types, but especially for African Americans, American Indian/Alaska Natives, and the uninsured, who are at higher risk for obesity. Policy changes in the healthcare environment could improve access to obesity counseling. 

3) Results and Conclusion: Overall, receipt of both counseling methods declined from 2003-2009, but a slight increase was observed for the low-cost/free insurance group after 2007. Whites generally received more exercise counseling, while Hispanics and African Americans received more nutrition counseling. Private health insurance was associated with more exercise counseling. This highlights the need for targeted counseling efforts for different racial/ethnic groups and insurance types to address obesity risks."
"student perception of their dental school experience is an essential measure of the success of dental education . 
 undergraduates ' feedback and suggestions are very important for improving the curriculum and learning process . 
 this information also helps determine the students ' preferences regarding different elements of their educational experience . 
 endodontics teaching can be considered complex  difficult  and stressful because of the complex anatomy of the root canal system  responsibility toward patients  and low self - confidence . 
 however  teaching endodontics in recent years has improved as a result of the development of knowledge  techniques  and materials . 
 dental students at taibah university  saudi arabia  take a preclinical full - year endodontic course in the 3 year of their 6-year bachelor of dental surgery degree . 
 the course consists of 28 h of theoretical lectures and 28 3-h laboratory sessions  during which they perform technical aspects of root canal treatment on extracted single- and multi - rooted teeth . 
 there is a one - semester clinical endodontic course in the 4 year that consists of 14 theoretical lectures and fourteen 3-h clinical sessions during which students treat single- and multi - rooted teeth . in the 5 year  endodontic treatments are performed as part of a comprehensive dentistry care course under the supervision of specialists . 
 this study examined the endodontic experiences  perceptions of endodontic practice  and self - rated confidence of dental students enrolled in taibah university  saudi arabia . 
 study approval was obtained from the research ethics committee of the college of dentistry  taibah university ( reference number : tucdrec/20160107/alrahabi ) . 
 this study enrolled 41 undergraduate dental students registered in endodontic courses in the 2015 academic year at the college of dentistry  taibah university  saudi arabia . 
 participation was voluntary  and students were informed that they could refuse participation . a questionnaire was distributed to 19 4-year and 25 5-year students in the final month of the academic year after they had had the maximum amount of training . 
 the questions evaluated self - confidence at performing nonsurgical root canal treatment and experiences in this discipline . 
 the level of confidence was classified using a 5-point scale as  very confident    confident    neutral    not very confident   or  not at all confident .  to compare results  the chi - square test and mann  whitney u - test were used . 
 statistical analyses were carried out using spss version 20.0 ( spss  chicago  il  usa ) . statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 . 
 the overall response rate was 93%  with 18 of the 19 4-year students and 23 of the 25 final - year students returning questionnaires . 
 table 1 shows the results for the first three questions ( first endodontic case treated  level of case difficulty  and number of endodontic treatments performed by the student ) . 
 first endodontic case treated  level of case difficulty  and number of endodontic treatments performed self - confidence of 4th- and 5th - year dental students regarding the steps of nonsurgical root canal treatment levels of confidence in the different steps of root canal treatment confidence levels differed significantly between 4- and 5-year students in the following steps of root canal treatment : determining the working length  taking and interpreting radiographs during root canal treatment  evaluating the quality of root canal obturation  and recalling the patients periodically in the correct manner . 
 table 3 summarizes the results of the last question regarding suggestions to improve the teaching of endodontic courses . 
 in dentistry  evaluating competence is an important step toward validating the quality of graduating dentists  although the relationship between the self - confidence and clinical competence of medical students is not fully understood . increasing the confidence of medical students should increase their competence in clinical practice . 
 one way to standardize education is to poll students using questionnaires to help in the assessment  evaluation  and improvement of education . 
 this study obtained information about the confidence of undergraduate dental students at taibah university  saudi arabia regarding endodontics . 
 it revealed that an upper incisor 78% was the most common tooth first treated by students . 
 upper incisor root canal treatment is relatively easy  and this should encourage students . in another study  
 most of our students described the experience with the first case as okay 78%  while 7.4% described it as easy and 14.6% described the first case as difficult  possibly because the first case for those students involved a molar or premolar . 
 in other studies  students considered molars to be the most difficult tooth to treat . in our study  the maximum number of teeth treated in the 4 year was four cases  by 66.7% of the students  while the maximum number of teeth treated in 5 year was 11 cases  by 8.8% of the students . 
 the number of teeth treated by students in the 4 and 5 year did not meet the recommendations of the european society of endodontology 2001 guidelines  which advised that for adequate competency a student should complete root canal treatments in 20 teeth . 
 although the european society of endodontology published new undergraduate curriculum guidelines for endodontology in 2013  these focused on the quality and consistency of student performance more than simply the quantity of clinical exposure . 
 however  one study reported that 81% of the students in 48 dental schools in the european union achieved the minimum number of root canal treatments required for their graduation : the number of treated cases ranged between 3 and 80 canals  and the average was 17 canals . in our study 
  we observed that confidence varied according to both the year the student was in and the practical steps of nonsurgical root canal treatment . 
 both groups reported relatively good confidence  although there were significant differences between 4 and 5 year students regarding some steps . 
 fourth - year students were more confident than 5-year students in the following : determining the working length  dealing with x - rays during root canal treatment  evaluating root canal obturation  and recalling patient at the correct time . 
 this might be because there were fewer 4-year students in the sample  there are fewer requirements in 4 year  and strict supervision by supervisors helped 4-year students more than 5-year students . confidence regarding working length determination was low in both 4- and 5-year students 
 . this might be the result of the root canal anatomy  which many dental students find difficult to learn because of its variation among individuals . 
 the reduction in confidence regarding endodontic radiology  the evaluation of root canal obturation  and determining the correct recall period probably results from insufficient clinical exposure . 
 murray et al . wrote that a lack of clinical exposure in the undergraduate curriculum reduces the confidence that develops with clinical practice . 
 students ' suggestions for improving the teaching of endodontics focused on two major issues : using rotary nickel - titanium ( niti ) files during treatment and increasing credit hours for the endodontic course . introducing advances in endodontics into undergraduate training  such as niti rotary instruments  may improve the clinical experience of students and their self - confidence because it will help increase the numbers of cases treated . 
 believe that introducing niti rotary instruments into the undergraduate dental curriculum would be safe and improve endodontics teaching because inexperienced operators can learn to use rotary instruments adequately with brief training . 
 nevertheless  another study found that intensive preclinical training is a prerequisite for using niti rotary instruments . 
 changing the methods of teaching endodontics so that students can complete root canal treatment more easily and quickly  with minimal procedural accidents  will improve clinical outcomes . 
 low self - confidence can be ameliorated by increasing clinical exposure  which will help students to obtain the necessary skills through experience . 
 fourth- and fifth - year dental students at taibah university  saudi arabia  are confident regarding root canal treatment  although they report lower confidence in some steps of the root canal treatment process . 
 endodontics education should be improved by increasing preclinical and clinical sessions and using new teaching methods that introduce recent advances in endodontics in the undergraduate curriculum .

1) Abstract: This study examined the endodontic experience, perceptions, and self-rated confidence of dental students in Taibah University, Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire was distributed to 41 undergraduate students, and data was analyzed using SPSS 20.0.

2) Research and Discussion: Dental students were relatively confident in performing nonsurgical root canal treatments but showed lower confidence levels in endodontic radiology, evaluating root canal obturation, and determining recall periods. These findings suggest a need to improve students' confidence and clinical competence in endodontics.

3) Results and Conclusion: The participation rate was high, with the maxillary incisor as the most common tooth treated. Faculty should focus on enhancing students' confidence in endodontics to effectively perform root canal treatments. Further research can explore effective methods to increase students' confidence and clinical competence in endodontics. "
"a 36-year - old woman complained of an insidious onset of generalized myoclonus that first became apparent at age 27 years . 
 she had no perinatal problems and her development was normal in childhood and juvenile periods . 
 adult - onset myoclonus had worsened progressively from right hand to four extremities  tremulous voice and gait disturbance developed after 3 years from disease onset  and she could not continue working as a nurse . 
 she had no history of febrile convulsions or seizure  infectious disease in the central nervous system  exposure to toxic materials  or intake of herbal drugs . 
 her younger brother aged 40 years old also had progressive generalized myoclonus  which was detected 6 years ago at age 34 years ( figure 1 ) . 
 the patient was alert and oriented  and her mini - mental state examination score was 30 . 
 she did not have gaze palsy  and her vision and hearing were normal ; however  her voice was tremulous and generalized positive myoclonus was observed at four extremities and body . 
 negative myoclonus  dystonia  tremor  and rigidity were not detected  and both motor and sensory functions were intact . 
 there was no evidence of cerebellar dysfunction  and she did not have an ataxic or parkinsonian gait  although she staggered slightly because of myoclonus . 
 examination of the eyes revealed cherry - red spots ( figure 2 )  but her electroencephalogram was normal . 
 no white matter lesion or cerebellar atrophy was detected in an mri of her brain ( figure 3 ) . 
 neuraminidase  hexosaminidase a  and -galactosidase activities in the leukocytes and cultured fibroblasts in patient and younger brother were normal . 
 the cherry - red spot is a pale perifoveal ring that develops when large deposits of lipid  sphingolipid  or oligosaccharide material accumulate in the ganglionic cells at the macula.2 this is a characteristic finding in storage diseases  including the sialidoses  gm1 and gm2 gangliosidoses  neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis  niemann - pick disease ( groups a through d )  farber s lipogranulomatosis  and metachromatic leukodystrophy . 
 interestingly  niemann - pick disease  farber s lipogranulomatosis  and metachromatic leukodystrophy are not associated with myoclonus . moreover 
  the patient in this report did not have typical findings of these 3 diseases such as the organomegaly  cognitive impairment  and gaze palsy seen in niemann - pick disease4 ; the hoarseness  arthritis  and subcutaneous nodules seen in farber s lipogranulomatosis ; or the abnormal brain mri findings in metachromatic leukodystrophy . 
 in ceroid lipofuscinosis  sialidosis  gm1 and gm2 gangliosidoses  myoclonus  and maculopathy ( e.g. a cherry - red spot ) may coexist . 
 although they are quite similar in appearance  the macular abnormality seen in patients with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ( which has been described as  bulls - eye maculopathy  ) can be distinguished from the cherry - red spot by color and shape  as well as by the decreased visual acuity and visual - field restriction that are common in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.5 moreover  adult - onset lipofuscinosis has an autosomal dominant inheritance  rather than the autosomal recessive pattern seen in this patient.6 gm1 gangliosidosis results from a deficiency of -galatosidase ; the adult form ( type 3 ) presents as a slowly progressive dementia with prominent parkinsonian features and extra - pyramidal dysfunction  particularly dystonia.7 gm2 gangliosidosis results from a deficiency of hexosaminidase a ; the late form ( with an onset during adolescence and young adulthood ) may be characterized by cognitive dysfunction  cerebellar dysfunction  upper and lower motor neuron involvement  and extrapyramidal dysfunction.8 because -galatosidase and hexosaminidase activity was normal in this patient  because she has a normal level of intelligence  and because no other prominent pyramidal or extrapyramidal dysfunction was detected  we might not diagnose this patient as gm1 and gm2 gangliosidoses . 
 sialidosis is an inherited  autosomal recessive disease associated with a neuraminidase deficiency.9 it has 2 major clinical manifestations : type i ( late  adult onset ) and type ii ( early  infantile onset ) . 
 type i sialidosis is typically found in patients aged 8 to 25 years and is characterized by cherry - red spot myoclonus  seizure  neuropathy  corneal clouding  and difficulty walking  but with normal vision and intelligence ( obrien  1978 ) . 
 type ii sialidosis is characterized by dysmorphism  myoclonus  mental retardation  ocular cherry - red spots  and hepatosplenomegaly . 
 the patient in this report may present clinical evidence of type i sialidosis  but her laboratory findings do not support this diagnosis ; activities of the neuraminidase were normal . 
 a similar case of progressive myoclonic epilepsy has been reported.10 differences from the previous report which described a patient with progressive myoclonic epilepsy  cherry - red spots and negative enzyme deficiency were theses ; 1 ) the onset - age was older than the previous report ( 27 versus 13 years  adult versus juvenile - onset ) ; 2 ) the patient had a sibling with same disease  which indicated she had inherited disease  but the patient in previous report did not have familial history ; 3 ) the patient in our report did not have a history of seizure  and it is different from the patient with myoclonic epilepsy . although the cause of cherry - red spot myoclonus is not clear  to our knowledge  this is the first report of adult - onset familial cherry - red spot myoclonus caused by an unknown type of lysosomal storage disease in korea .","

Abstract:
We present a case of a 36-year-old woman with progressive generalized myoclonus, with a familial history of similar symptoms. Examination revealed cherry-red spots in her eyes, but enzyme activity tests showed no abnormalities. Despite the negative laboratory findings, the presence of cherry-red spots, progressive myoclonus, and autosomal recessive inheritance pattern indicated a possible unknown type of lysosomal storage disease.

Research and Discussion:
The patient's condition is a rare and unknown type of lysosomal storage disease, as indicated by the presence of cherry-red spots and an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Enzyme activity tests for hexosaminidase A, -galactosidase, and neuraminidase were normal, which is not typical for lysosomal storage diseases. This case highlights the importance of considering clinical symptoms and familial history, along with laboratory tests, to diagnose rare diseases.

Results and Conclusion:
The patient's presentation, along with the familial history, suggests a possible unknown type of lysosomal storage disease. Despite normal enzyme activity tests, the presence of cherry-red spots and an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern strongly supports this diagnosis. Further research and testing may help identify the specific lysosomal storage disease in this patient and aid in the development of potential treatments. It is important for clinicians to consider the possibility of rare diseases with atypical presentations, as early diagnosis and treatment can greatly improve patient outcomes."
"with the worldwide spread of mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) strains resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin ( rif )  multidrug - resistant ( mdr ) tuberculosis ( tb ) has become a major public health problem posing formidable challenges due to its complex diagnostic and treatment requirements . 
 this highlights the need for having rapid molecular diagnostic techniques which could help facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate delivery of anti - tubercular therapy 
 . xpert mtb / rif assay ( cepheid )  a real - time automated nucleic acid amplification system is one such technique which detects mtb as well as mutations that confer resistance to rif in > 2 h. it was installed in our institute ( guru gobind singh medical college and hospital  faridkot ) in october 2013 under revised national tuberculosis control programme ( rntcp ) tb xpert project supported by who - stop tb partnership - unitaid . 
 rif is a principle first line anti - tb drug and rif resistance is a surrogate marker for mdr - tb . 
 the genetic basis of rif resistance ( in approximately 95% cases ) is the presence of mutations in 81 bp rif resistance determining region ( rrdr ) of the rpob gene  corresponding to codons 507533 ( escherichia coli numbering system )  which codes for a beta subunit of rna polymerase of mtb . 
 studies conducted in diverse geographical areas have shown that the burden of mdr - tb and the mutations responsible for drug resistance vary from country to country and region to region . 
 however  there is not enough of information about this important aspect from north india and the data from malwa region of punjab is almost lacking . 
 therefore  this retrospective study was conducted to determine the frequency of rif resistance and rpob gene mutations among the suspected tb / mdr cases of malwa region of punjab ( districts : faridkot  fazilka  firozpur  moga  bathinda  and muktsar - area approximately 14981 km )  using xpert mtb / rif assay . 
 knowledge of the pattern of mutations present in rif - resistant isolates could provide insight into the epidemiology of rif - resistant mtb isolates of this particular area . 
 a total of 1612 sputum specimens which originated from patients with suspected mdr pulmonary tb of malwa region of punjab were received in microbiology laboratory  under rntcp for xpert mtb / rif assay between october 2013 and february 2015 . 
 the samples were subjected to ziehl - neelsen ( zn ) staining and xpert mtb / rif assay . 
 the xpert mtb / rif assay was performed directly on sputum specimens using the xpert mtb / rif assay g4 version 5 and the software version 4.4a as per the manufacturer 's instruction ( cepheid  sunnyvale  ca  usa ) . briefly  it consisted of inactivation of the sputum specimen with naoh and isopropanol ( sample reagent ) used in 1:2 ratio for 15 min . 
 the mixture was then introduced into the xpert mtb / rif cartridge and loaded into the xpert mtb / rif instrument for dna extraction and amplification of 192 bp segments of the rpob gene . 
 the detection consists of hybridization of the amplicon with five overlapping probes complementary to the rpob  core 
 the reports were communicated electronically to the concerned district tb officer and drug - resistant tb center . 
 chi - square test of proportions was used to identify a significant difference between two or more groups  and p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant . to determine the association of various epidemiological characteristics of the patients to rif - resistant tb 
  odds ratio ( or ) and 95% confidence interval ( ci ) were calculated using spss statistical software version 20.0.0 ( spss inc .  
 the relationship of smear positivity grade with the relative bacterial burden and xpert mtb / rif ct value ( given in genexpert operator 's manual by cepheid ) was also analyzed .

 the relationship of smear positivity grade with the relative bacterial burden and xpert mtb / rif ct value ( given in genexpert operator 's manual by cepheid ) was also analyzed . 
 out of 1612 specimens tested  1308 were positive for mtb by xpert mtb / rif assay . 
 there were 34  errors  and 18 specimens showed  no results .  all these specimens were retested  and valid results were obtained except in two ( one showed error in the second sample also and another could not be processed due to insufficient material in the second specimen ) . 
 zn staining of the 1308 specimens positive for mtb by xpert mtb / rif assay showed that 1240 were positive for acid fast - bacilli ( afb ) with 272 ( 21.9% ) being grade 3 positive . 
 correlation of smear positivity grade with relative bacterial burden and ct value showed that out of total 272 grade 3 positive specimens  69.4%  22.5%  6.5%  and 1.6% had high ( ct < 16 )  medium ( ct 1622 )  low ( ct 2028 )  and very low ( ct > 28 ) bacterial load  respectively . 
 of the specimens showing grade 2  grade 1 scanty positivity  the maximum belonged to high and medium  high and medium  and medium bacterial load groups  respectively . in sputum negative specimens ( 68/1308 ) the maximum number belonged to low bacterial load group . 
 of 1308 mtb - positive samples by xpert tb / rif assay  130 ( 9.9% ) demonstrated rif resistance . 
 results were obtained in 4 specimens and on retesting 2 came out to be rif sensitive . 
 all these 4 specimens were smear - positive and had ct value was > 28 . 
 the study of the association of epidemiological characteristics of the patients to the rif - resistant tb showed that rif resistance was present in statistically significant higher number in previously treated patients in comparison to the new patients ( 95% ci 1.1487.135  p = 0.006 and or = 2.86 ) and in patients with afb - positive sputum smears to afb - negative smears ( 95% ci 0.91115.5  p = 0.048 and or 3.7 ) . 
 however  the difference was found to be statistically insignificant between the different age groups of patients ( p = 0.053 )  male and female patients ( 95% ci 0.7061.57  p = 0.798 and or 1.054 )  patients from rural and urban background ( 95% ci 0.691.49  p = 0.918 and or 1.02 ) and hiv - positive and hiv - negative patients ( 95% ci 0.2194.13  p = 0.949 and or 0.953 ) . the study of mutation pattern of rif resistance in 130 specimens revealed that in 129  rpob gene mutations in 81 bp rrdr of mtb were detected by one of the 5 different probes ( a  b  c  d  e )  while in one specimen  mutation combination  i.e. mutations associated with more than one probe ( a and b both ) was present . the probe frequencies associated with the observed rif resistance were as follow : e 73/130 ( 56% )  b 28/130 ( 21.5% )  d 18/130 ( 13.8% )  a 11/130 ( 8.4% )  and c 1/130 ( 0.7% ) [ table 1 ] . 
 accordingly  the frequencies of mutations at 5 different rpob gene regions were 529533 ( 56% )  512518 ( 21.5% )  523529 ( 13.8% )  507511 ( 8.4% )  and 518523 ( 0.7% ) . district - wise pattern of mutations seen in 130 rifampicin resistant tuberculosis specimens correlation of mutations with the rif - resistant sputum specimens obtained from different districts [ table 1 ] revealed that probe e which represented mutation in region 529533 was the most common in all the six districts of the study . 
 only one specimen revealed rif resistance by probe c depicting mutation in codon region 518523 . 
 out of 1612 specimens tested  1308 were positive for mtb by xpert mtb / rif assay . 
 there were 34  errors  and 18 specimens showed  no results .  all these specimens were retested  and valid results were obtained except in two ( one showed error in the second sample also and another could not be processed due to insufficient material in the second specimen ) .

 results were obtained in 4 specimens and on retesting 2 came out to be rif sensitive . 
 all these 4 specimens were smear - positive and had ct value was > 28 . 
 the study of the association of epidemiological characteristics of the patients to the rif - resistant tb showed that rif resistance was present in statistically significant higher number in previously treated patients in comparison to the new patients ( 95% ci 1.1487.135  p = 0.006 and or = 2.86 ) and in patients with afb - positive sputum smears to afb - negative smears ( 95% ci 0.91115.5  p = 0.048 and or 3.7 ) . 
 however  the difference was found to be statistically insignificant between the different age groups of patients ( p = 0.053 )  male and female patients ( 95% ci 0.7061.57  p = 0.798 and or 1.054 )  patients from rural and urban background ( 95% ci 0.691.49  p = 0.918 and or 1.02 ) and hiv - positive and hiv - negative patients ( 95% ci 0.2194.13  p = 0.949 and or 0.953 ) . the study of mutation pattern of rif resistance in 130 specimens revealed that in 129  rpob gene mutations in 81 bp rrdr of mtb were detected by one of the 5 different probes ( a  b  c  d  e )  while in one specimen  mutation combination  i.e. mutations associated with more than one probe ( a and b both ) was present . the probe frequencies associated with the observed rif resistance were as follow : e 73/130 ( 56% )  b 28/130 ( 21.5% )  d 18/130 ( 13.8% )  a 11/130 ( 8.4% )  and c 1/130 ( 0.7% ) [ table 1 ] . 
 accordingly  the frequencies of mutations at 5 different rpob gene regions were 529533 ( 56% )  512518 ( 21.5% )  523529 ( 13.8% )  507511 ( 8.4% )  and 518523 ( 0.7% ) . district - wise pattern of mutations seen in 130 rifampicin resistant tuberculosis specimens correlation of mutations with the rif - resistant sputum specimens obtained from different districts [ table 1 ] revealed that probe e which represented mutation in region 529533 was the most common in all the six districts of the study . 
 only one specimen revealed rif resistance by probe c depicting mutation in codon region 518523 . 
 although  india ranks first out of the 22 countries with the highest burden of tb  but the reliable information on the magnitude of mdr - tb in the country is largely unavailable . by using xpert mtb / rif assay  we observed rif resistance which is a surrogate marker of mdr - tb in 9.9% of suspected cases of mdr - tb of malwa region of punjab . 
 however  higher prevalence of mdr - tb has been reported in other indian studies ( lucknow 27.8%  new delhi 17.9%  and central india 17% ) . globally  3.7% of new cases and 20% of previously treated cases are estimated to have mdr - tb . in india  
 the estimated figure in new cases with mdr - tb is 2.1% with ci 1.52.7 and estimated percentage in previously treated cases is 15% with ci of 1317  respectively . 
 rntcp carried out drug - resistant surveys in accordance with global guidelines and indicated a low prevalence of mdr - tb  i.e.  > 3% among new cases and 1217% in previously treated cases in gujarat  and maharashtra and andhra pradesh . in the present study  
 the figure was 3.9% ( 5/126 ) in the new and 10.6% ( 125/1182 ) in the retreatment cases  and the difference between the two was statistically significant ( p = 0.006 ) . 
 gupta et al . had also observed that mdr - tb was significantly higher in previously treated cases compared to new cases and concluded that the previous exposure to anti - tb agents was the most common cause of developing mdr . in the present study 
  another statistically significant association was seen between smear - positive mdr cases in comparison to smear - negative mdr cases ( p = 0.048 ) . 
 gupta et al . had also observed a higher but statistically insignificant association of mdr - tb with smear positivity . 
 this could be because all the mdr - tb patients of our study had pulmonary tb and these patients are more likely to have cavitary lesions and positive sputum smear results . 
 our study population showed slightly higher prevalence of rif resistance in hiv - negative patients than hiv - positive patients but statistically the difference was insignificant ( p = 0.949 ) . 
 this is in contrast to the study of gupta et al . who observed a statistically significant difference in mdr - tb in hiv - negative in comparison to a hiv - positive group of patients . 
 quy et al . reported that the failure of treatment of mdr - tb was associated with mdr and not with hiv infection . 
 although statistically there were insignificant differences between different age groups showing mdr - tb ( p = 0.053 )  a maximum number of cases in the present study were in the age group of 2140 years . 
 other indian studies have also reported the predominance of younger age group with mdr - tb . 
 there were also a higher number of male patients and patients from a rural background with mdr - tb in our study . 
 as young adult males are economically productive segment of our society  high mdr - tb in this group has several socioeconomic implications . while detecting tb / mdr cases  xpert mtb / rif assay showed 2.1% ( 34/1612 ) errors in the present study . 
 mboowa et al . have reported 12% errors using xpert mtb / rif assay g3 version 3 and g4 version 5  with more than half being contributed by the former version . 
 the lower percentage of errors in the present study could be because that we used the upgraded g4 version 5 of xpert mtb / rif assay . 
 similar to our study  rufai et al . have reported 1.8% errors using xpert mtb / rif assay g4 . 
 nwokoye et al . have stated that low bacterial load limits the ability of the xpert mtb / rif assay to correctly identify mutated and wildtype sequences in the core region of the rpob gene . 
 the  indeterminate  results of rif resistance detected in four samples of the present study could be because of their high ct value ( > 28 ) corresponding to the very low bacterial burden . 
 while using xpert mtb / rif assay for the detection of mtb and rif resistance in mdr suspected cases  we could collect additional information on mutations associated with rif resistance . 
 it was observed that the pattern of mutations in the 81 bp rrdr of mtb isolates of the present study was almost similar to that reported from other parts of india . 
 the most common rrdr rpob gene mutations were in the gene region 529533 ( 56% ; table 1 ) in all the six districts of malwa region and were recognized by probe e. mboowa et al . 
 too used xpert mtb / rif assay and the most common gene mutations observed were in codon 531 ( 58% ) followed by 513 ( 25% )  526 ( 8% )  and 511 ( 8% ) designed by probes e  b  d  and a. singhal et al . 
 used genotype mtbdr plus assay and reported 531 as the most commonly mutated codon in 59.0% . similarly  mani et al . 
 reported that the codons most commonly involved in these mutations were 531 ( 53% ) and 526 ( 19% ) in a study from south india . 
 the resistant mutants isolated more frequently in clinical practice have higher mean relative fitness and their prevalence depend on their ability to survive . 
 this might be the reason for the higher occurrence of mutations in codon 531533 . in our study  we observed rif resistance by probe c ( 518523 ) in one of the 130 rif resistant sputum samples . 
 this is similar to the findings of gupta et al . who used dna sequencing combined with ms - pcr assay to observe mutation in this rpob region . 
 in contrast  no rif resistance was found to be associated with probe c in the study of mboowa et al . 
 this could probably be because of lesser susceptibility of this genetic region to mutations or because the selection pressure shaping ( producing ) probe c associated rif resistance is less in malwa region of punjab ( north india ) . 
 mutation combination ( probe a and b ) was observed in one ( 1/130 ) of the rif - resistant specimens in the present study . while  singhal et al . found 6 strains ( 6/366 ) with more than one mutations and mboowa et al . 
 reported no specimen with more than one probe failure ( mutation combination ) while employing xpert mtb / rif assay in their study . 
 probably  mutations continue to arise due to the ability of mtb to adapt to drug exposure . 
 the limitation of the study was that no gold standard was used for the comparison of xpert mtb / rif assay results . 
 xpert mtb / rif is a better screening tool for detection of mtb and rif resistance in a shorter period of time  and this could help improve early recognization of mdr - tb and prevention of its further transmission in malwa region of punjab . 
 this assay also appears to be a useful technique to have simultaneous preliminary information regarding the mutation pattern of rif resistance in mtb isolates which could be helpful in understating the epidemiology of the disease and identification of hot spots for implementation of tb control program . 
 however  for the confirmation and the detailed study on these mutations  dna sequencing remains indispensable .

Abstract:

The use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay has greatly improved the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) by detecting the bacteria and rifampicin (RIF) resistance in less than 2 hours. This study aims to assess the epidemiology of RIF-resistant TB and mutations in the rpoB gene in the Malwa region of Punjab, India. A total of 1612 specimens were tested using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and the results were analyzed using statistical software.

Research and Discussion:

Previous treatment and positivity of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were found to be significantly associated with RIF resistance. Mutations in the rpoB gene were seen in 130 specimens, with the most common being e and b, followed by d, a, and c. This study highlights the usefulness of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay in detecting MTB and RIF resistance, as well as providing preliminary information on the mutation patterns of RIF resistance in MTB isolates.

Results and Conclusion:

RIF resistance was found to be higher in previously treated patients and those with AFB-positive smears. Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a quick and easy screening tool for detecting TB and RIF resistance, making it useful for suspected TB/MDR cases. This study also offers valuable insight into the mutation patterns of RIF resistance in MTB, which can inform treatment strategies."
"the hallmark of autoimmune diseases is the pathologic activity of the immune system of an organism directed against its own cells and tissues . 
 the disease is a direct consequence of tissue and/or organ damage as mediated by autoreactive components of the immune system  that is  autoreactive t - lymphocytes and/or autoantibodies . for diagnostic purposes  
 autoantibodies are the most important analytes . within the systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases ( sard )  anti - nuclear antibodies ( ana )  directed against various cellular components  and associated autoantibodies  such as antibodies reactive with dsdna and extractable nuclear antigens ( ena )  are fundamental for diagnosis [ 13 ] . 
 traditionally  ana are detected by indirect immunofluorescence ( iif ) performed on human epithelial cells ( hep-2 ) . 
 this technique requires a multistage process consistent with visual determination of the staining pattern  serial titrations of positive sera  followed by a second test in which autoantigen specificity is determined [ 2  4 ] . 
 recently  the american college of rheumatology ( acr ) stated that ana detection by iif is still considered the gold standard . 
 this was primarily based on the high sensitivity of the iif assay and the inclusion of ana detection by iif assay in diagnostic criteria of systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) and autoimmune hepatitis ( aih ) [ 68 ] . 
 in addition  ana can also be considered as a screening test for samples that require further testing for autoantigen specificity  that is  dsdna and ena [ 2  9 ] . 
 the specificity of ana detection by iif  however  is relatively poor  especially when low titres are used for screening . indeed  at a 1  :  40 serum dilution  
 2530% of healthy individuals may test positive for ana and this increases even further upon ageing [ 1  10 ] . 
 overall  it is recommended that the serum dilution that gives a specificity of 95% in healthy individuals should be used as cut - off . 
 moreover  the clinical significance rises with increasing titres [ 11  12 ]  as well as with the identification of the responsible autoantigen [ 1  9 ] . 
 obviously  a positive ana test must always be interpreted cautiously and only within the clinical context of the patient . in a clinical setting where the pretest probability of sard is generally low  as in primary care  the added value of a positive ana test is lower as compared to secondary and tertiary care situations where pretest probabilities of sard are often higher . in the current study 
  we determined the prevalence of ana in primary ( general practices )  secondary ( regional hospital )  and tertiary care ( university hospital ) . besides data on ana prevalence  also ana titres and anti - ena and anti - dsdna antibodies were included in our analyses . 
 we hypothesize that ana prevalence  ana titre  and anti - ena / dsdna reactivity increase from primary to tertiary care as these situations are expected to be also associated with an increasing pretest probability of sard . 
 in the present study  three different patient populations from the southern part of the netherlands were evaluated and compared with each other . 
 these three populations consisted of patients who were tested for ana between november 2011 and august 2012 in suspicion of an autoimmune disease . 
 all ana requests were considered to involve the diagnostic workup since none of the patients had requests for ana ( and/or anti - ena / dsdna ) at least 4 years prior to the study period . in the first patient population 
 ( n = 1453 ) ana were requested by general practitioners ( primary care ) . the second population ( n = 1621 ) had an ana request in a regional hospital ( secondary care )  while the third population ( n = 1168 ) had an ana request in a university hospital ( tertiary care ) . testing for ana in the first and second cohorts 
 was performed in the atrium mc ( heerlen  the netherlands )  while the ana tests in the third cohort were performed in the maastricht university medical centre ( mumc  maastricht  the netherlands ) . 
 furthermore  in both regional and university hospitals  the origin  that is  hospital department  of ana requests was documented . 
 ana detection by iif was performed on hep-2000 cells according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer ( immuno concepts  sacramento  ca ) . 
 hep-2000 cells are transfected with the gene for ssa-60  which makes these cells more sensitive for ssa - antibody detection [ 14  15 ] . 
 fitc - conjugated goat anti - human igg antibody was used for detection of ana . 
 five staining patterns were considered ana positive : homogenous  atypical speckled  speckled  centromere  and nucleolar . in case of mixed - patterns  
 slides were evaluated with a fluorescent microscope ( axioskop  carl zeiss microscopy gmbh  jena  germany ) with led light source . 
 all slides were evaluated by two independent observers ; in case of a difference in opinion  a third observer was decisive . 
 the presence of anti - ena antibodies was screened by a commercially available line immunoassay ( ana 3 profile euroline  euroimmun  lbeck  germany ) . 
 after the first incubation with diluted serum  a second incubation was performed with goat anti - human igg linked to alkaline - phosphatase . finally  a third incubation took place with bromochloroindolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride ( bcip / nbt ) as substrate to detect anti - ena antibodies . 
 although the ana 3 profile euroline kit enables detection of 15 different antigens  only eight were evaluated in the current study : ro52  ss - a / ro60  ss - b / la  nrnp / sm  sm  scl-70 ( topoisomerase 1 )  jo-1  and cenp - b . 
 reading of the results was automated and the colour intensities of the reactions were evaluated by the eurolinescan program ( euroimmun ) to enable semiquantitative determination  that is  equivocal  1 +  2 +  and 3 + . 
 results were considered positive for sm  scl-70  and jo-1 if the intensity was at least equivocal  while for ss - a / ro60  ss - b / la  nrnp / sm  and cenp - b an intensity of at least 1 + was required . finally  the cutoff for ro52 was 2 + . 
 positive lia results  as defined above  were confirmed with a commercially available feia ( elia  immunodiagnostics  thermo fisher scientific  freiburg  germany ) . 
 this method uses highly purified ( smd ) or recombinant ( ss - a / ro60  ro52  ss - b / la  cenp - b  scl-70  jo-1  rnp70  and u1rnp ) human antigens that are coated on irradiated polystyrene cups . the assay was performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
 the sera were diluted 1  :  50 with dilution buffer . after binding of anti - ena antibodies  the cups were washed and subsequently incubated with mouse anti - human igg ( heavy chain specific ) conjugated to  -galactosidase . in case of antibody association  binding was detected fluorometrically using 4-methylumbellifery--d - galactoside ( 0.01% ) as substrate . 
 for all antigens  values above 10  u / ml were considered positive . in primary and secondary care  anti - dsdna antibodies 
 were detected with a commercially available feia ( elia  immunodiagnostics  thermo fisher scientific ) . 
 this method uses a circular plasmid dsdna  purified from escherichia coli  as antigen . 
 the assay was performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions and as described for the anti - ena antibodies . 
 the sera were diluted 1  :  10 in dilution buffer and values above 15  u / ml were considered positive . in tertiary care  
 anti - dsdna antibodies were detected by the crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence test ( clift ; immuno concepts ) . 
 fitc - conjugated goat anti - human igg antibody was used for detection of anti - dsdna antibodies . 
 slides were evaluated with a fluorescent microscope ( axioskop  carl zeiss microscopy gmbh ) with led light source . 
 all slides were evaluated by two independent observers ; in case of a difference in opinion  a third observer was decisive . 
 all samples were tested first by ana iif . if the result was negative  no further testing was performed  unless specifically requested . 
 however  the results of these additional tests were not included in the present study . 
 if the ana iif was positive  irrespective of the staining pattern  titration was performed ( 1  :  320 and 1  :  1280 ) . 
 if a homogenous ana pattern was detected  testing for anti - dsdna antibodies was performed by feia ( primary and secondary care ) or clift ( tertiary care ) . 
 additionally  in case of a homogenous  ( atypical ) speckled  or centromere pattern  typing for anti - ena antibodies was performed by lia . 
 because of the high correlation between the atypical speckled ana pattern and ss - a / ro60 antibodies  these antibodies were considered positive if the atypical speckled ana pattern was observed in combination with either a positive lia or a positive feia . 
 similarly  anti - cenp - b antibodies were considered positive when a centromere ana pattern was observed in combination with a positive anti - cenp - b result in at least one of both anti - ena antibody test systems . 
 since the lia does not enable specific distinction of anti - rnp antibodies  positivity for the nrnp / sm complex was followed by testing for antibodies against rnp70 and u - rnp by feia . 
 chicago  il ) or graphpad prism version 6 ( graphpad software inc .  la jolla  ca ) . 
 the kolmogorov - smirnov analysis was performed to determine whether the age distributions of the three study populations were normally distributed . 
 furthermore  the chi square test  with yates ' correction if appropriate  was performed when comparing proportions of groups . in the case of small samples  
 of the three patient populations included  90 ( 6.2% )  175 ( 10.8% )  and 187 ( 16.0% ) patients from primary ( n = 1453 )  secondary ( n = 1621 )  and tertiary care ( n = 1168 )  respectively  were tested positive for ana and were therefore eligible for the current study . 
 gender ( f / m ) and age ( median and range ) distribution were as follows : 78/12 and 57.2 ( 1595 ) for primary care  129/46 and 57.0 ( 1793 ) for secondary care  and 130/57 and 57.3 ( 384 ) for tertiary care . 
 the gender distribution differed significantly ( p = 0.009 ) due to a strong female preponderance in primary care . 
 the age distribution differed significantly ( p = 0.005 ) due to the fact that in tertiary care age distribution was skewed negatively . 
 evaluation of the origin  that is  hospital departments  of the ana requests in secondary and tertiary care revealed four departments  that is  rheumatology  dermatology  internal medicine  and neurology  which requested the majority of the ana screening tests ( figure 1(a ) )  that is  86% and 68%  respectively . 
 the prevalence of ana in the 3 distinct clinical settings is depicted in figure 2(a ) . 
 the higher relative ana prevalence in tertiary care ( 16.0% ) versus secondary care ( 10.8% ) was apparent in all 4 clinical disciplines that requested the majority of ana screening test ( figure 1(a ) ) ; this also holds for the other clinical disciplines ( data only shown as pooled results ) 
 . typically  in secondary care 39.5% of overall ana requests came from the rheumatology department  while in tertiary care this was 15.4% . within the positive ana cohorts  patients from primary care had relatively low titres 
 out of 90 positive ana tests 63 sera ( 70% ) revealed an ana titre of 1  :  80 . in secondary and tertiary care  a titre of 1  : 
 consequently  higher titres were observed more frequently in secondary and tertiary care than in primary care . 
 the distribution in titres between secondary and tertiary care was not different . at first glance 
  there is no apparent difference in the distribution of ana patterns between the three health care levels ( figure 2(c ) ) . 
 also  comparison of the distribution of ana patterns with a titre of 1  :  1280  considered to have the highest positive likelihood ratio  showed no significant differences ( data not shown ) . 
 the prevalence of anti - ena and anti - dsdna antibodies  as defined by the algorithm described above  is presented in figure 3(a ) . in the primary care  19 ( 21.1% ) 
 patients with positive ana ( n = 90 ) were tested positive for anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna antibodies  that is  1.3% of the total cohort . in the secondary and tertiary care  
 68 of 175 ( 38.9% ) and 40 of 187 ( 21.4% ) ana positive patients revealed anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna reactivity  respectively . 
 this is 4.2% and 3.4% of the total secondary and tertiary care cohorts  respectively ( p = 0.367 ) . 
 significantly more positive anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna results were found in the total secondary and tertiary care cohorts than in the primary care cohort ( p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0006  resp . ) . in secondary care  
 the prevalence of anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna reactivity within the positive ana samples was the highest in the requests from rheumatology ( figure 1(b ) ) . 
 in tertiary care  however  departments of rheumatology and neurology had  on average  reduced prevalence of anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna reactivity as compared to the departments of dermatology and internal medicine ( figure 1(b ) ) . 
 since the relevance of anti - ena and anti - dsdna antibodies is considered to increase when combined reactivity is observed  we analysed the prevalence of anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna antibodies in relation to combined reactivity ( figure 3(b ) ) . in the primary care setting 
  single positivity appeared to be more abundant than in secondary and tertiary care  but this difference was statistically not significant . 
 no differences were observed between secondary and tertiary care settings either . with respect to the antigens recognized by the specific antibodies  
 no apparent differences were observed in the prevalence of antibodies reactive to rnp  ssa60  ro52  ssb  cenp - b  and dsdna ( figure 3(c ) ) . 
 anti - scl70 antibodies were only detected in samples of patients from secondary and tertiary care . 
 however  the absolute number  one in each cohort  was low in both of these settings . 
 in the present study on the analyses of ana prevalence  ana titre and anti - ena specificity in the primary  secondary  and tertiary care  our results indicate that ( i ) ana prevalence significantly increases from primary to tertiary care  ( ii ) low titres ( 1  :  80 ) are more frequently observed in the primary care  and ( iii ) anti - ena and anti - dsdna specificities are significantly more prevalent in the secondary care than in the primary care . 
 interpretation of the data obtained in the current study is highly dependent on the viewpoint on clinical utility of an ana test result . 
 this result may help the clinician to identify a patient with sard  but especially in situations with low pretest probabilities of such diseases  the risk of false interpretation of a positive ana is high . 
 this risk of false positive interpretation will decrease if the positive ana is characterized by high titre and includes ( multi)-reactivity for ena and/or dsdna  since these characteristics are associated with higher positive likelihood ratios [ 11  12  17 ] . 
 next  one has to realize that ana testing is performed in the context of multiple diseases  varying from distinct sard to autoimmune liver diseases . 
 interpretation of a positive ana test may be different for each distinct disease : patients with  for instance  aih or systemic sclerosis often have a positive ana with no ena reactivity  while a positive ana test as such is part of the classification criteria for sle  as well as aih [ 68 ] 
 . a negative ana test result  on the other hand  may also be very useful to exclude a specific set of diseases and may drive attention to other diseases . 
 again  this differs for the distinct sard : a negative ana test has a high negative predictive value for sle and systemic sclerosis but is less helpful to exclude sjgren 's syndrome or myositis [ 2  3 ] . 
 obviously  definite interpretation of our dataset is hampered by the lack of clinical data from the patients of the three cohorts . 
 the assumption of the primary care having a relatively low pretest probability was based on previous studies [ 13  18  19 ] . for future studies 
  we recommend the inclusion of clinical data in order to be able to thoroughly assess pretest probabilities and strengthen our assumptions . 
 this study  however  also has noteworthy strengths  that is  only data obtained during the diagnostic workup of patients ( not follow - up samples ) were included and the same testing algorithm and reagents ( except for detection of anti - dsdna antibodies ) were used for all three patient cohorts . 
 as expected  we observed a gradual increase in the prevalence of ana from primary to tertiary care . in our present study ana 
 was detected by iif in a screening dilution of 1  :  80 . in several studies 
 it has been reported that 1015% of healthy controls are ana positive in this serum dilution [ 1  10  20 ] . 
 obviously  a positive ana test result is not only dependent on the dilution factor but also on the quality of other reagents  that is  fluorescent conjugate  cell substrate  and the fluorescent microscope . for standardization purposes  
 it has  therefore  been recommended to screen for ana with a specificity of 95% . 
 taking this into account  the mere presence of ana in our primary care cohort ( prevalence 6.2% ) lacks discriminating power to identify patients with sard . on the other hand  due to the high negative predictive value of a negative ana result 
 furthermore  since both high titre and anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna ( multi-)reactivity may increase the likelihood of identifying a patient with sard [ 11  12  17 ]  it is apparent in our primary care cohort that 30% of ana positive sera are of medium to high titre ( n = 27 )  21% contain anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna reactivity ( n = 19 )  and 37% of the latter reveal multireactivity ( n = 7 ) . in our secondary and tertiary cohorts  the ana prevalence is also relatively low ( 11 and 16%  resp . )  but in both clinical settings about half of the ana positive sera are of high titre ( 48 - 49% ) . as expected  the observed anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna reactivity of ana positive sera in the secondary care ( 39% ) is higher than in the primary care . 
 surprisingly  anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna reactivity in the tertiary care ( 21% ) is lower than in the secondary care and similar to the primary care . 
 this might be related to the spectrum of diseases investigated in the tertiary versus the secondary centres . 
 also the higher number of ana requests by tertiary care departments not typically involved in the diagnosis of sard might be the result of academic profiling of the respective departments . 
 for instance  the cardiology department of the mumc is specialized in inflammatory cardiomyopathies and a possible autoimmune aetiology of these diseases . 
 cardiology requested 108  ana tests ( 9.2% )  revealing 13% ana positive results of which 20% was anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna antibody positive . 
 a second important difference is the presence of a division of clinical immunology within the department of internal medicine of the tertiary care hospital  implying that many patients with sard are evaluated by clinical immunologists instead of rheumatologists . 
 the latter difference might at least explain the lower relative prevalence of anti - ena and anti - dsdna antibodies in the rheumatology department of the tertiary care hospital . 
 our study shows that in secondary care the majority of positive ana results ( 92.6% )  as well as the positive anti - ena and anti - dsdna results ( 95.6% )  are linked to the departments of rheumatology  dermatology  internal medicine  and neurology . 
 obviously  patients with the highest pretest probabilities for sard  as associated with the initial clinical presentation  are most likely referred to these clinical departments . 
 in clinical settings with lower pretest probabilities  ana positive sera are more likely to be of no clinical significance [ 13  18  19 ] . 
 it might therefore be an option  in particular in primary care settings  to move away from the traditional ana screening test . in this context  the recent discovery of the dense fine speckled ( dfs70 ) antigen is promising and could offer a possible solution for the identification and exclusion of positive sera with no clinical relevance [ 21  22 ] . the typical ana dense fine speckled pattern ( dfs )  known to be associated with the dfs70 antigen  has been found to be commonly prevalent in healthy individuals with ana positive sera ( 33.1% )  whereas in sard patients 0.0% of the sera revealed a dfs pattern . 
 another study revealed that 2 - 3% of sard patients had antibodies directed to the dfs70 antigen . obviously  in sard patients other anti - ena antibodies might be present that hamper correct recognition of the dfs iif pattern 
 indeed  the identification and correct interpretation of the dfs pattern might prove to be challenging for diagnostic laboratories and would require additional training . 
 moreover  the majority of patterns recognized do not seem to be compatible with a dfs pattern  but this might be the consequence of only interpreting the strongest pattern in the current study . 
 since the identification of the dfs pattern might be challenging for routine diagnostic laboratories and inaccurate interpretation can have significant consequences  an immunoadsorption protocol to diminish anti - dfs70 antibody reactivity to hep-2000 cells could be implemented in the current iif assay in order to significantly improve the performance characteristics of the ana iif test [ 21  25 ] . 
 this approach sustains recognition of sard - related autoantibodies in sera with combined reactivities  that is  anti - dfs70 and other anti - ena antibodies . 
 another alternative testing algorithm could  instead of ana iif  include solid phase assays including multiplex and screening assays for well - defined anti - ena and anti - dsdna reactive antibodies [ 11  12  26  27 ] . both approaches enable to distinguish or reduce the number of positive ana results lacking clinical relevance . 
 in addition  multiplex anti - ena screening assays are considered to better recognize particular antigens  for example  ssa and jo-1  as compared to ana iif testing [ 3  11  12  28 ] . 
 altogether  the results indicate that in the primary care the usage of traditional ana screening tests is more prone to false - interpretation of positive ana results 
 . rather  an alternative testing algorithm for detection of patients with sard might be more appropriate . 
 this might either be achieved by immunoadsorption of anti - dfs70 antibodies or direct screening for anti - ena antibodies . 
 obviously  a patient with severe clinical manifestations typical for sard presenting in a primary care setting should be referred directly  that is  without any laboratory testing  to the rheumatologist or clinical immunologist . 
 this recommendation may not only apply for general practitioners but may also hold for clinical departments that are less likely to encounter patients suspected of sard .","

1) Abstract: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) in different healthcare settings and to assess their utility in the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD). Results showed an increase in ANA prevalence from primary to tertiary care, with a higher prevalence of low titres and a lower prevalence of anti-ENA and anti-dsDNA reactivities in primary care. 
2) Research and Discussion: The study shows that positive ANA results are more likely to be misinterpreted in low pretest probability clinical settings, such as primary care. Alternative approaches, such as immunoadsorption of anti-dfs70 antibodies or implementation of anti-ENA screen assays, may be needed to improve the accuracy of ANA testing in these settings.
3) Results and Conclusion: ANA prevalence increases from primary to tertiary care, with a higher prevalence of low titres and a lower prevalence of anti-ENA and anti-dsDNA reactivities in primary care. As a result, positive ANA results may be more prone to false interpretation in primary care, highlighting the need for alternative approaches to improve accuracy."
"in the last 2 decades  cross - sectional imaging  in particular multidetector computed tomography ( mdct )  has become the main investigation of choice in the locoregional and distant staging of many tumours within the abdomen and pelvis . 
 mdct benefits from having a high spatial resolution and fast acquisition time  making it an ideal tool to stage and restage tumours . 
 the routine use of intravenous ( and oral contrast ) media  unless contraindicated  also helps to delineate sites of disease  especially within solid organs . 
 the identification of nodal involvement on ct is based on nodal size  typically using a minimum cutoff of 1  cm in short axis diameter  although this can lead to both under- and over - staging of metastatic nodal involvement . 
 the purpose of this pictorial review is to discuss the imaging appearances on ct of some of the more common cancers arising within the abdomen and pelvis and to describe their typical sites of local  nodal and haematogenous tumour spread . 
 cancers arising from the stomach  pancreas  colon  kidney  ovary and prostate will be reviewed  with summary tables provided . 
 ninety percent of tumours are adenocarcinomas  which are subdivided into two main histological types : ( 1 ) the well - differentiated ( intestinal ) type  which is associated with atrophic gastritis  occurs in older patients and has a better survival rate and ( 2 ) the undifferentiated ( diffuse / signet ring ) type  which is more common  occurs more frequently in women and has a poorer prognosis . 
 gastric adenocarcinoma occurs either proximally ( cardia ) or distally ( non - cardia )  with the former increasing in incidence whilst the latter is declining ( see table  1 ) .

 involvement of the stomach wall is seen as thickening or irregularity of the inner / middle layer of the gastric wall ( t1 tumours ) or transmural thickening with abnormal contrast enhancement ( t2 tumours ) . 
 wall thickness has been reported to be greater and of higher attenuation in the diffuse histological type compared to the intestinal type . 
 gastric cancer spreads in a predictable fashion through the gastric wall with the presence of perigastric fat stranding and nodular outline suggestive of serosal involvement ( t3 tumours ) ( fig .  1 ) .

 sign describes the clinical finding of an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node due to metastatic involvement . 
 abdominal cancers may metastasise to this site via the thoracic duct  and gastric malignancy is classically described as the commonest primary tumour to do this . 
 obstructive jaundice with associated bile duct dilatation may occur  due to enlarged porta hepatis nodes or due to the spread of gastric tumour via the gastrohepatic ligament directly into the liver . 
 haematogeneous spread via the portal vein to the liver occurs in 25% of patients at presentation  with liver metastases typically appearing as rim - enhancing low - attenuation lesions during the portal venous phase . 
 peritoneal disease secondary to gastric adenocarcinoma may mimic the appearance of peritoneal disease secondary to metastatic ovarian carcinoma  with omental cake and/or discrete peritoneal deposits noted within the abdominal cavity . 
 trans - coelomic spread is also characteristic of gastric cancer  with spread to the ovary resulting in a krukenberg tumour that typically appears as a mixed solid / cystic adnexal mass . 
 involvement of the peritoneal reflection within the pelvis can result in a positive blumer s shelf finding  with tumour found high on the anterior rectal wall . 
 it should be noted that other histological tumour types arising from the stomach have different patterns of tumour spread . 
 gastrointestinal stromal tumours ( gists ) are the most common primary mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract  distinct from true smooth muscle and neural tumours  and are derived from the interstitial cells of cajal . 
 they are most frequently located within the stomach ( 6070% ) and should be regarded as having malignant potential . 
 gists typically involve the outer muscular layer of the gi tract  and thus often demonstrate exophytic growth ( fig .  2 ) . 
 most appear as well - defined extraluminal or combined intraluminal / extraluminal masses on ct . if small  they tend to be of homogeneous attenuation ; if larger  they are more heterogeneous on both the unenhanced and enhanced scans because of necrosis or haemorrhage . the central areas of necrosis may communicate with the gastric lumen . 
 if arising from the stomach  the tumour may extend into the gastrohepatic ligament  the gastrosplenic ligament and the lesser sac . 
 nodal spread is extremely rare  but haematogenous spread can occur  often to the liver with nearly 50% of patients with gists presenting with metastases ( fig .  2 ) .

 the pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ and has a close anatomic relationship with the abdominal peritoneal reflections . 
 the pancreatic head is connected to the liver and lesser curvature of the stomach via the hepatoduodenal ligament and gastrohepatic ligaments  respectively . 
 the tail of the pancreas is in continuity with the hilum of the spleen and the greater curvature of the stomach via the splenorenal and gastrosplenic ligaments .

 most colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps  with polyps greater than 2  cm in size associated with a greater than 40% risk of malignancy . for local staging of rectal cancer 
  mri is now the standard imaging modality because of its increased soft tissue resolution and multiplanar capabilities . 
 colorectal tumours may appear as polypoid or infiltrative lesions of the bowel wall ( fig . 
 early colonic tumours are better detected when endoluminal distension is given and the colon has been prepared  as in ct colonography . 
 tumour spread through the serosa appears as pericolonic fat stranding  but may be confused with an associated desmoplastic reaction ( possibly mimicking diverticulitis within the sigmoid colon ) . 
 the presence of fluid in the root of the sigmoid mesentery and engorgement of the adjacent sigmoid mesenteric vasculature favours diverticulitis  whilst the presence of pericolic lymph nodes is suspicious for colon cancer . 
 tumour spread to adjacent organs is suggested by loss of the fat planes and direct invasion ( see table  3 ) .

 these vessels include the ileocolic vessels and right colic vessel for the ascending mesocolon  the middle colic vessels for the transverse mesocolon  and the inferior mesenteric vein for the sigmoid and descending mesocolon . for rectal tumours  
 drainage is usually cranial within the mesorectum to involve the regional lymph nodes ( table  3 ) . 
 5 ) is less common  with involvement of the inguinal nodes only seen with lower rectal tumours when there is proximal lymphatic blockage ( e.g. extensive adenopathy ) . 
 5rectal adenocarcinoma : coronal reformat cect showing a bulky rectal tumour ( asterisk ) with enlarged right internal iliac nodes ( double asterisk ) and left paraaortic node ( arrow ) rectal adenocarcinoma : coronal reformat cect showing a bulky rectal tumour ( asterisk ) with enlarged right internal iliac nodes ( double asterisk ) and left paraaortic node ( arrow ) metastatic disease at presentation is uncommon ( < 1015% of cases ) . 
 haematogeneous spread is predominantly seen within the liver  with metastases deriving their blood supply from the hepatic artery ( compared to normal liver parenchyma  which is primarily supplied by the portal vein ) . as a result  
 liver metastases imaged during the portal venous phase are seen as heterogeneous ring - enhancing metastases that are hypodense to the surrounding liver parenchyma ( fig . 
 for example  the venous drainage of the colon and upper rectum is via the portal vein  and thus the liver is a common site of spread . 
 however  the lower rectum has a dual drainage  with the superior haemorrhoidal vein draining into the inferior mesenteric vein and then into the portal vein  and the middle and inferior haemorrhoidal veins draining into the pelvic veins and then directly into the inferior vena cava . 
 this explains why distal rectal cancers can result in isolated pulmonary metastases without hepatic metastases . 
 if rectal tumours perforate the peritoneal membrane  transcoelomic spread may occur  favouring the lower right small bowel mesentery and pouch of douglas . 
 if colorectal tumours are of mucinous histology  widespread intraperitoneal mucinous metastases may occur with characteristic scalloping of adjacent viscera ( pseudomyxoma peritoneii ) ( fig . 
 6pseudomyxoma peritoneii : axial cect showing mucinous ascites exerting mass effect ( scalloping ) on the solid organs ; primary was of gastrointestinal tract origin pseudomyxoma peritoneii : axial cect showing mucinous ascites exerting mass effect ( scalloping ) on the solid organs ; primary was of gastrointestinal tract origin on ct  renal tumours appear as hypervascular masses  with larger lesions of heterogenous attenuation . with increasing size  they spread through the renal capsule into the perinephric fat to involve gerota s fascia . 
 early extension through the renal capsule is recognized by an indistinct tumour margin  thickened perirenal fascia and perinephric fat stranding . 
 extension into the renal vein occurs in 20% of patients at presentation with involvement of the inferior vena cava ( ivc ) in 510% of patients ( fig . 
 tumour thrombus is seen as a filling defect within the vein  which should not be confused with streaming artefact from unopacified blood . 
 the presence of venous distension on its own may be misleading as rccs are hypervascular and hence tend to have increased blood flow and venous drainage . 
 distinction between tumour thrombus and bland thrombus within the ivc may be difficult  although the former may have enhancing tumour vessels within it . 
 in advanced tumours  direct invasion into adjacent structures such as the diaphragm  and posterior abdominal wall muscles may be seen ( see table  4 ) .

 there are also direct connections with the thoracic duct and mediastinum  which can account for the rare presence of mediastinal and hilar node involvement ( fig . 
 metastatic involvement in renal cell carcinoma is seen ( in order of decreasing frequency ) in : the lung ( 5060% )  bone ( 3040% )  liver ( 3040% )  adrenal gland ( 5% )  contralateral kidney ( 5% )  retoperitoneum ( 5% ) and brain ( 5% ) . 
 more unusual sites that have been reported include the pancreas  peritoneum  bowel  thyroid and muscle ( fig . 
 7c ) . cross - sectional imaging ( ct or mri ) is used for preoperative tumour assessment  with ct being the imaging modality of choice for assessing metastatic disease . 
 bowel opacification is usually achieved with a positive oral contrast medium ( e.g. dilute gastrograffin )  which is essential for the detection of peritoneal deposits . 
 intravenous contrast is also routinely administered unless contraindicated  with imaging performed in the portal venous phase . 
 conversely  local pelvic spread is better assessed with pelvic mri than ct ( see table  5 ) .

 common sites include the greater omentum  paracolic gutters  the pouch of douglas  the liver capsule ( fig . 
 less commonly  implants may be seen within the mesentery  along the porta hepatis  lesser sac  splenic surface and gastrosplenic ligament [ 1618 ] . 
 ascites are often present  due to either increased production from tumour surfaces or reduced peritoneal resorption from invasion of lymphatics by tumour cells . 
 peritoneal deposits on ct have a variety of appearances including enhancing nodular soft tissue lesions  linear / plaque - like thickening of peritoneal reflections ( fig . 
 8c )  tiny calcifications or mixed solid and cystic or purely cystic lesions [ 19  20 ] . 
 the involvement of bowel serosa can lead to ( asymmetric ) bowel wall thickening  tethering of bowel loops and bowel obstruction . 
 liver surface implants ( subcapsular deposits ) may be seen  with deposits causing characteristic scalloping of the liver capsule . 
 metastatic mucinous tumours of the ovary can lead to pseudomyxoma peritoneii  although in many of these cases  the primary mucinous tumour actually arises from the gastrointestinal tract with secondary involvement of the ovary . 
 lymphatic spread occurs via three routes and is usually seen in conjunction with peritoneal spread . 
 routes include : ( 1 ) along the ovarian vessels to the common iliac and para - aortic nodes ( fig . 
 8a ) ; ( 2 ) via the broad ligament and parametria to the internal iliac and obturator nodes ; and ( 3 ) rarely via the round ligaments to the external iliac and inguinal nodes . 
 cardiophrenic nodes ( defined as > 5  mm short axis diameter on ct )   are characteristically involved as they are the main lymphatic drainage route from the peritoneal cavity ( fig . 
 haematogenous dissemination is rare in ovarian carcinoma with a malignant pleural effusion being the most common manifestation . at presentation  
 other sides of spread include the spleen  kidneys  adrenals  lungs  brain and bone . 
 mri is traditionally used for local staging of prostate cancer because of its high contrast resolution ( as in rectal cancer ) . 
 it is able to differentiate organ - confined disease from tumour that demonstrates extracapsular spread . 
 direct involvement of the seminal vesicles or adjacent organs is also well seen on mri . 
 ct is used for nodal and distant staging of prostate cancer ( see table  6 ) .

 osteoblastic sclerotic metastases rather than lytic bone lesions are usually seen on ct . in order of decreasing frequency  skeletal metastases are seen within the vertebrae ( fig . 
 spinal involvement is initially more common within the lumbar region and less likely within the cervical spine ( 97% cf . 
 pulmonary metastases occur in between 527% of patients at presentation   and are more often seen in association with the second pattern of nodal involvement . 
 pulmonary involvement can either appear as lymphangitis carcinomatosa ( due to direct invasion of the pulmonary lymphatics ) or as pulmonary nodules ( due to haematogenous spread ) [ 22  24 ] . 
 ninety percent of tumours are adenocarcinomas  which are subdivided into two main histological types : ( 1 ) the well - differentiated ( intestinal ) type  which is associated with atrophic gastritis  occurs in older patients and has a better survival rate and ( 2 ) the undifferentiated ( diffuse / signet ring ) type  which is more common  occurs more frequently in women and has a poorer prognosis . 
 gastric adenocarcinoma occurs either proximally ( cardia ) or distally ( non - cardia )  with the former increasing in incidence whilst the latter is declining ( see table  1 ) .

 involvement of the stomach wall is seen as thickening or irregularity of the inner / middle layer of the gastric wall ( t1 tumours ) or transmural thickening with abnormal contrast enhancement ( t2 tumours ) . 
 wall thickness has been reported to be greater and of higher attenuation in the diffuse histological type compared to the intestinal type . 
 gastric cancer spreads in a predictable fashion through the gastric wall with the presence of perigastric fat stranding and nodular outline suggestive of serosal involvement ( t3 tumours ) ( fig .  1 ) .

 sign describes the clinical finding of an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node due to metastatic involvement . 
 abdominal cancers may metastasise to this site via the thoracic duct  and gastric malignancy is classically described as the commonest primary tumour to do this . 
 obstructive jaundice with associated bile duct dilatation may occur  due to enlarged porta hepatis nodes or due to the spread of gastric tumour via the gastrohepatic ligament directly into the liver . 
 haematogeneous spread via the portal vein to the liver occurs in 25% of patients at presentation  with liver metastases typically appearing as rim - enhancing low - attenuation lesions during the portal venous phase . 
 peritoneal disease secondary to gastric adenocarcinoma may mimic the appearance of peritoneal disease secondary to metastatic ovarian carcinoma  with omental cake and/or discrete peritoneal deposits noted within the abdominal cavity . 
 trans - coelomic spread is also characteristic of gastric cancer  with spread to the ovary resulting in a krukenberg tumour that typically appears as a mixed solid / cystic adnexal mass .

 on ct  renal tumours appear as hypervascular masses  with larger lesions of heterogenous attenuation . with increasing size  they spread through the renal capsule into the perinephric fat to involve gerota s fascia . 
 early extension through the renal capsule is recognized by an indistinct tumour margin  thickened perirenal fascia and perinephric fat stranding . 
 extension into the renal vein occurs in 20% of patients at presentation with involvement of the inferior vena cava ( ivc ) in 510% of patients ( fig . 
 tumour thrombus is seen as a filling defect within the vein  which should not be confused with streaming artefact from unopacified blood . 
 the presence of venous distension on its own may be misleading as rccs are hypervascular and hence tend to have increased blood flow and venous drainage . 
 distinction between tumour thrombus and bland thrombus within the ivc may be difficult  although the former may have enhancing tumour vessels within it . 
 in advanced tumours  direct invasion into adjacent structures such as the diaphragm  and posterior abdominal wall muscles may be seen ( see table  4 ) .

 there are also direct connections with the thoracic duct and mediastinum  which can account for the rare presence of mediastinal and hilar node involvement ( fig . 
 metastatic involvement in renal cell carcinoma is seen ( in order of decreasing frequency ) in : the lung ( 5060% )  bone ( 3040% )  liver ( 3040% )  adrenal gland ( 5% )  contralateral kidney ( 5% )  retoperitoneum ( 5% ) and brain ( 5% ) . 
 more unusual sites that have been reported include the pancreas  peritoneum  bowel  thyroid and muscle ( fig . 
 cross - sectional imaging ( ct or mri ) is used for preoperative tumour assessment  with ct being the imaging modality of choice for assessing metastatic disease . 
 bowel opacification is usually achieved with a positive oral contrast medium ( e.g. dilute gastrograffin )  which is essential for the detection of peritoneal deposits . 
 intravenous contrast is also routinely administered unless contraindicated  with imaging performed in the portal venous phase . 
 conversely  local pelvic spread is better assessed with pelvic mri than ct ( see table  5 ) .

 common sites include the greater omentum  paracolic gutters  the pouch of douglas  the liver capsule ( fig . 
 less commonly  implants may be seen within the mesentery  along the porta hepatis  lesser sac  splenic surface and gastrosplenic ligament [ 1618 ] . 
 ascites are often present  due to either increased production from tumour surfaces or reduced peritoneal resorption from invasion of lymphatics by tumour cells . 
 peritoneal deposits on ct have a variety of appearances including enhancing nodular soft tissue lesions  linear / plaque - like thickening of peritoneal reflections ( fig . 
 8c )  tiny calcifications or mixed solid and cystic or purely cystic lesions [ 19  20 ] . 
 the involvement of bowel serosa can lead to ( asymmetric ) bowel wall thickening  tethering of bowel loops and bowel obstruction . 
 liver surface implants ( subcapsular deposits ) may be seen  with deposits causing characteristic scalloping of the liver capsule . 
 metastatic mucinous tumours of the ovary can lead to pseudomyxoma peritoneii  although in many of these cases  the primary mucinous tumour actually arises from the gastrointestinal tract with secondary involvement of the ovary . 
 lymphatic spread occurs via three routes and is usually seen in conjunction with peritoneal spread . 
 routes include : ( 1 ) along the ovarian vessels to the common iliac and para - aortic nodes ( fig . 
 8a ) ; ( 2 ) via the broad ligament and parametria to the internal iliac and obturator nodes ; and ( 3 ) rarely via the round ligaments to the external iliac and inguinal nodes . 
 cardiophrenic nodes ( defined as > 5  mm short axis diameter on ct )   are characteristically involved as they are the main lymphatic drainage route from the peritoneal cavity ( fig . 
 haematogenous dissemination is rare in ovarian carcinoma with a malignant pleural effusion being the most common manifestation . at presentation  
 other sides of spread include the spleen  kidneys  adrenals  lungs  brain and bone . 
 mri is traditionally used for local staging of prostate cancer because of its high contrast resolution ( as in rectal cancer ) . 
 it is able to differentiate organ - confined disease from tumour that demonstrates extracapsular spread . 
 direct involvement of the seminal vesicles or adjacent organs is also well seen on mri . 
 ct is used for nodal and distant staging of prostate cancer ( see table  6 ) .

 spinal involvement is initially more common within the lumbar region and less likely within the cervical spine ( 97% cf . 
 pulmonary metastases occur in between 527% of patients at presentation   and are more often seen in association with the second pattern of nodal involvement . 
 pulmonary involvement can either appear as lymphangitis carcinomatosa ( due to direct invasion of the pulmonary lymphatics ) or as pulmonary nodules ( due to haematogenous spread ) [ 22  24 ] . 
 this review has described the typical patterns of tumour spread for the more common cancers occurring within the abdomen and pelvis . 
 knowledge of the characteristic sites of spread in such cancers is felt to be essential for the radiologist when reporting staging and restaging ct scans . 
 it is hoped that the summary tables in particular will act as a useful aide - mmoir to the reporting radiologist . 
 correct identification of metastatic sites of disease is important  as this will not only have an impact on patient management  but also a bearing on patient prognosis .",".

Abstract:
In this pictorial review, the role of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in staging various abdominal and pelvic cancers is discussed. The aim is to identify the typical sites of local, nodal, and haematogenous spread for cancers of the stomach, pancreas, colon, kidney, ovary, and prostate. This information is crucial for accurate disease identification and patient management.

Research and Discussion:
MDCT has become the preferred imaging modality for cancer staging, and its ability to accurately detect and characterize tumor spread has greatly impacted patient management and prognosis. This review specifically focuses on cancers of the abdomen and pelvis, discussing their characteristic CT findings and common sites of spread. An understanding of these patterns is essential for effective treatment planning.

Results and Conclusion:
The study highlights the importance of identifying specific sites of tumor spread in abdominal and pelvic cancers through MDCT. This information has significant implications for patient management and prognosis. With an accurate understanding of the imaging appearances, clinicians can make informed decisions and provide appropriate treatment for these common cancers."
"the long - term use of immunosuppressive agents for prevention of allograft rejection increases the risk of malignancy approximately 100 times as high as that in the general population . 
 the prevalence rate of post - transplant malignancies in total differs between geographical areas ; for example  in europe  that rate is 1.6% and in australia is 24%  with a mean of 6% . 
 skin cancers  mostly squamous cell carcinoma ( scc )  are the most common tumors among persons have solid organ transplantation . 
 but  however  iranian studies found that the most common malignancy after kidney transplantation was kaposi sarcoma ( ks ) among the iranian patients . 
 ks is a skin tumor of multicentre origin  characterized histologically by endothelium - lined vascular spaces and spindle - shaped cells . 
 ks presents as single or multiple lesions on mucosal surfaces  including the skin  lungs  gastrointestinal tract and lymphoid tissues . 
 the etiopathogenes of ks is complex and poorly understood  but is almost certainly dependent on human herpes virus type 8 ( hhv -8 ) infection in immunosuppressed  immunogenetically susceptible individuals . 
 although the treatment of ks is controversial  it should ideally address these pathogenic issues . 
 the current guideline is reduction of immunosuppression as first - line treatment  but these recommendations are based on anecdotal experience or uncontrolled studies . 
 perhaps the most fundamental controversy that has implications for all aspects of the disease surrounds the nature of ks : i.e. whet her it is a true malignancy or reversible hyperplasia . 
 the aim of present study was to investigate the frequency of ks in patients with kidney transplantation in 21 years period . 
 an observational prospective follow - up study with a retrospective component  carried out in the imam reza hospital from kermanshah university of medical sciences ( kums ) during the period 19912012 . 
 patients with pre - transplant neoplasm will be excluded from the analysis ( n = 46 ) . 
 patients who had received transplants were identified through the hospital 's transplant registry . for each patient  information includes donor and recipient characteristics  patient and graft survival and cancer incidence after transplantation  data of serologic tests such as hiv were received . 
 the period of follow - up for each patient starts on the day of transplantation and continues until death or last reported contact . following the methodology used in similar studies  patients will not be removed from the analysis at the time of graft failure for several reasons . 
 we usually suspect ks when a kidney recipient presents with multiple hyperpigmented cutaneous nodules that may be associated with gastrointestinal discomfort and pulmonary symptoms resistant to conventional therapies . 
 then a battery of endoscopic  bronchoscopic  radiologic and pathologic tests is used to diagnose ks . 
 there were two main distinct periods of immunosuppressive regimen : the first period was from 1991- 2002 azathioprine  cyclosporine and prednisolone . 
 the second period was from 2002 onwards during which the patients received triple immunosuppressive therapy consisting of cellcept  cyclosporine and prednisolone at the same dosages mentioned above . 
 induction therapy using anti - thymocyte globulin ( atg ) or anti - lymphocyte globulin ( alg ) was preserved to the high risk patients in the early phase of transplantation or treatment of acute rejection ; okt-3 was not used in any of the studied populations . 
 the doses of immunosuppressive agents were reduced  with changed drugs to sirolimus  or the agents were withdrawn upon diagnosis of ks . 
 the method of reduction of immunosuppression and decision on which the agent to be reduced or withdrawn were dependent on the individual patient 's health condition  response to treatment and his / her physician 's judgment . 
 from march 1991 to december 2012  1487 kidney transplantations were performed . among them  67 malignant diseases were diagnosed in 64 patients with an overall incidence of 4.5% and ks was diagnosed as more frequent malignancy in 17 ( 25.37% ) patients ( table 1 ) . of these 17 ks patients  10 were males and 7 were female with median age of 47.8 years old . 
 the mean time between transplantation and non - ks malignant tumors was 34.4  21.8 months ( range 12140 months )  while in ks patients it was 18.7  25.2 months  which was statistically significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 after detection of ks in 12 patients  we perform serum antibody detection against hhv . among them  8 ( 66.6% ) were seropositive . 
 data of characteristics of transplant patients with kaposi 's sarcoma were summarized in the table 2 .

 the sites of cutaneous involvement were lower extremities in 9 ( 52.9% )  followed by upper - limb involvement in 5 ( 29.41% ) patients . 
 other ks lesions occurred on trunk in 4 ( 23.5% ) and hard palate in 2 ( 11.7% ) patients . 
 immunosuppression was reduced in 10 ( 58.8% ) patients ( that 8 ( 80% ) patients of them received sirolimus ) and thoroughly withdrawn in the remainder ( including three cases of visceral involvement ) . in 2 ( 11.7% ) 
 patients immunosuppression was discontinued . in 11 ( 91 .6% ) of 12 patients  ks 
 skin lesions improved with therapy ( excluded are five patients who died soon after ks diagnosis ) . 
 patients received additional therapy arbitrarily if  in the opinion of the treating clinician  lesions were not improving . in the patients with hhv seropositive  ganciclovir were prescribed . the renal prognosis of patients who did not succumb to disseminated disease was related to the management of immunosuppression . 
 all two patients in whom immunosuppression was discontinued had functioning grafts when ks was diagnosed  but all grafts were acutely rejected . 
 one patient had azathioprine and one patient had cellcept immunosuppressive therapy and there is no significant difference between these two regimens ( p > 0.05 ) .

 post - transplantation ks is a well - known complication after renal transplantation with a possible negative impact on the patient 's and graft long term survival . 
 the ks incidence peaks during the first year post - transplantation . in our study  
 82.3% of all ks cases were diagnosed in the first 2 years after receiving a renal allograft  which is compatible with previous studies . 
 the results of this study showed lower incidence of ks ( 1.1% ) in our transplant population than that reported from other regional countries . 
 further  ks is frequent in african renal transplant recipients  where 13.3% of all transplanted patients developed ks . 
 we investigated the ks was the most frequent post - transplantation malignancies . in confirm to our study 
  saudi arabian and turkish studies were reported the most frequent post - transplantation malignancies were ks with 87.5% and 80.0%  respectively . also  nafar et al . 
  found that the most common malignancy after kidney transplantation was ks among the iranian patients . 
 the risk of death from dissemination of malignancy should be weighed against the risk of graft rejection . according our results  in 11 patients ( 91.6% ) ks skin lesions improved with reduction ( including 6 patients with sirolimus therapy ) or discontinued of immunosuppression with a graft loss rate of 11.7% . in compare to our study  
 reduction of immunosuppression resulted in complete remission of ks in 28% of patients from saudi arabia  and 61% of italian patients . 
 duman et al .  report on complete remission after reduction of immunosuppressive drugs in all patients [ 12/12 ]  with a graft loss rate of 20% in turkey . 
 reduction of immunosuppression allows for the immune system to reduce viral replication producing clinical remission of disease . 
 new antiviral agents have recently been introduced as a promising therapeutic option in patients with ks . however  prospective studies that will determine the efficacy of this approach are warranted . 
 sirolimus is a potent immunosuppressive drug that has been recently reported as an effective agent in the treatment of ks . 
 cutaneous ks lesions disappeared in all patients three months from the initiation of sirolimus therapy . 
 sirolimus may become the first choice immunosuppressant in renal transplant recipients with ks for pro - viding optimal immunosuppression and inhibiting the progression of malignancy . 
 hhv-8 has been described in patients with hiv infection and ks . the results of serologic studies support the notion that infection with hhv-8 is nearly universal in patients with ks  since specific antibodies are detectable in 70% to 90% of all patients with ks and almost 100% of immunocompetent patients with the disease . also it 's clear that pre - transplantation hhv-8 seropositivity is found to be associated with an increased risk of post - transplant ks . 
 immunosuppressive treatment may induce reactivation of latent virus infection  playing an important role in the development of combined iatrogenic and endemic ks . 
 it is also possible that hhv-8 may be transmitted from the donor to induce sarcoma development in the organ recipient . 
 we investigated that about 67% of our ks patients were seropositive for hhv after transplantation . 
 laboratory studies of the susceptibility of hhv-8 to antiviral drugs suggest that the virus is resistant to acyclovir and penciclovir  but sensitive to ganciclovir  foscarnet and cidofovir . 
 ks is a common long - term complication in renal transplant recipients  with an increased incidence compared with the general population . 
 given that candidates for organ transplantation who are seropositive for hhv-8 -and thus at risk for ks- can now be identified  chemoprevention should be available in this high - risk population . 
 such strategies in hhv-8-seropositive candidates for organ transplantation should be directed against the virus itself  and the immunosuppressive regimen should be carefully monitored to avoid the possibility of rejection ."," ?

1) Abstract: The study investigated the frequency of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in patients with kidney transplantation over a 20-year period. Out of 1487 recipients, 17 developed KS, with the mean time between transplantation and non-KS malignant tumors being significantly longer than that in KS patients. Chemoprevention should be available for high-risk patients.

2) Research and Discussion: The long-term use of immunosuppressive agents for allograft rejection greatly increases the risk of malignancy in kidney transplant recipients. This study found a significantly higher incidence of KS in these recipients compared to the general population. Seropositive recipients for human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), which increases the risk of KS, should receive chemoprevention.

3) Results and Conclusion: Analysis of 1487 patients revealed 17 cases of KS after kidney transplantation, with no significant differences in age or gender among affected patients. The mean time between transplantation and developing KS was significantly shorter compared to non-KS malignant tumors. Given the increased risk for KS in HHV-8 seropositive recipients, chemoprevention should be made available for this high-risk population as a long-term complication after kidney transplantation. "
"breast cancer is the most common cancer among american women  except for skin cancers . 
 the chance of developing invasive breast cancer at some time in a woman 's life is a little less than 12% . 
 it is the second leading cause of cancer death in women  exceeded only by lung cancer . 
 the chance that breast cancer will be responsible for a woman 's death is about 3% . 
 although clinical signs of disseminated disease occur in fewer than 10% of women at the time of diagnosis  the disease relapses in the form of metastasis within 5 years of surgery in about half of apparently localized tumors . 
 it is difficult to predict the occurrence of distant metastases since breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease encompassing complex pathologic entities . 
 a dynamic interaction between tumors and the immune system is essential for tumor survival  growth  and metastasis . 
 tumors are infiltrated with large number of immune cells that constitute a major cell population in the tumor microenvironment . 
 tumor cells depend on their microenvironment to provide signals for growth  anti - apoptosis  angiogenesis  and metastasis 
 . however  tumor cells are also under the surveillance due to their recognition by immune cells as foreign . 
 analysis of the interactions between tumor cells and the host 's immune system has led to the realization that tumor cells have devised multiple strategies to evade immune attack . 
 development of an invasive cancer  however  is not only a result of the genetic changes in the tumor cell but also the result of genetic and epigenetic changes within the host . 
 host cells  including inflammatory cells  endothelial cells  and fibroblasts  are recruited and activated in the microenvironment of transformed cells . 
 the acute inflammatory response might succeed in eliminating the malignant cells  but if not  a chronic inflammatory process develops in conjunction with the dying tumor cells . 
 the subsequent reciprocal interactions between these responding normal host cells and genetically altered cells result in the development of an invasive cancer . 
 there is a constant interplay between the innate and adaptive immune systems  which leads to a protective immune response against pathogens and transformed cells and contributes effectively to discrimination between self and nonself . 
 persistent protumor immune responses ( inflammation )  now generally accepted as initiating primary tumor development  are also being recognized as mediators of cancer metastasis . 
 thus  novel anticancer therapeutic strategies targeting molecular and/or cellular mechanisms regulating these collaborative interactions may provide efficacious relief for metastatic disease . 
 this paradox was first resolved by matzinger in 1994  who proposed that our immune system is designed to combat danger  rather than mediate recognition of nonself over self . 
 pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( pamps ) and endogenous molecules created upon tissue injury  since called damage - associated molecular patterns ( damps )  signal the threat of either infection or injury to the organism  independently of their nonself- or self - identity [ 710 ] . 
 damage - associated molecular patterns ( damps ) include endogenous intracellular molecules released by activated or necrotic cells and extracellular matrix ( ecm ) molecules that are upregulated upon injury or degraded following tissue damage . among the cellular receptors that sense these danger signals  toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) represent a key molecular link between tissue injury  infection  and inflammation . 
 tlrs are critical in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses and play a significant role in cancer immunosurveillance . 
 innate immune cells including natural killer ( nk )  natural killer t ( nkt )  and t cells play a critical role in protecting the host against cancer . 
 macrophages and dendritic cells ( dcs )  in particular  function as major sensors of invading pathogens and transformed cells via the tlrs . 
 adaptive immunity is crucial to the elimination of pathogens and tumor cells in the late phase of host defense responses and generates more specific tumor immunity and immunological memory . 
 tlrs are known to regulate cancer immunity and tolerance by controlling the suppressive function of regulatory t ( treg ) cell and through innate immune responses mediated by other immune cells [ 1113 ] . 
 tlr signaling  critical for innate and adaptive immune responses  has been thought to be restricted to immune cells . however  many studies suggest that tumor cells bear tlrs and that tlr signaling promotes tumor growth and immune evasion [ 1517 ] 
 . tlr activation by damps may initiate positive feedback loops where increasing tissue damage enhances proinflammatory responses leading to chronic inflammation . 
 as tlrs are widely expressed on tumor cells and immune cells and play important roles in the initiation and progression of cancer  they may thus serve as an important target and have an effective perspective on breast cancer treatment . 
 tlrs 1  2  4  5  and 6 are expressed on the cell surface ; tlrs 3  7  8  and 9 are found almost exclusively within endosomes . 
 different tlrs exhibit specificity for pathogen - derived ligands ; tlrs 2  3  4  5  7  and 9 recognize bacterial lipoproteins  double - stranded rna / poly ( i  :  c )  lipopolysaccharides ( lps )  flagellin  single - stranded rna  and cpg - containing dna  respectively [ 1823 ] . 
 tlr10 is expressed in humans but not in mice  tlr8 is not functional in mice and tlrs 11  12  and 13 are expressed in mice but not in humans . 
 there are several studies which suggest that damp - mediated inflammation plays a vital role . 
 necrotic cells were found to induce proinflammatory and tissue repair gene synthesis and cause dc maturation in a tlr2-dependent manner  as a result of the release of their intracellular contents . 
 other intracellular molecules such as heat shock proteins including hsp70  gp96  hsp22  and hsp72 and high - mobility group box-1 protein ( hmgb1 ) as well as ecm molecules such as biglycan  tenascin - c  versican  and fragments of ecm molecules including oligosaccharides of hyaluronic acid ( ha ) and heparan sulfate ( hs ) have been shown to activate tlrs . 
 tlr1  along with tlr2  was found to be important for the activation of professional antigen - presenting cells by -defensin-3  a host - derived antimicrobial peptide . 
 self - nucleic acids have also been described as endogenous danger signals  namely  mrna recognized by tlr3  single - stranded rna ( ssrna ) sensed by tlr7 and 8  and igg - chromatin complexes recognized by tlr9 . 
 tlr2  4  7  and 8 were shown to be activated by antiphospholipid antibodies ( apl ) isolated from patients with apl syndrome . 
 the signaling pathways utilized by various tlrs differ  which results in varied cellular responses . 
 for example  tlr3  the receptor for double - stranded rna couples to the adaptor protein trif . 
 in contrast  other tlrs couple to the adapter myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 ( myd88 ) [ 25  26 ] . 
 the traf6 in turn activates tak1 that phosphorylates and activates the ikk complex resulting in the release and translocation of nf-b to the nucleus . 
 tak1 also activates stress - activated protein kinase ( sapk ) pathways and activates c - jun - nh2-kinases ( jnk ) and p38 . 
 the myd88-coupled tlrs induce the synthesis of cytokines such as tnf-  il-6  and il-1  key mediators of the inflammatory response [ 27  28 ] . 
 tlr4  the receptor for lps  is unique in that it activates both myd88-dependent and trif - dependent pathways . 
 the link between inflammation and cancer is well documented [ 29  30 ] . several inflammatory diseases  including inflammatory bowel disease  increase the risk of cancer . 
 conversely  in tumors that are epidemiologically unrelated to overt inflammatory conditions ( such as breast cancer )  the activation of oncogenes can trigger the production of inflammatory molecules and the recruitment of inflammatory cells . in the tumor microenvironment  
 inflammatory cells and molecules influence almost every aspect of cancer progress  including the metastatic ability of tumor cells . 
 there is biological heterogeneity among tumors with regard to cellular infiltrates  identifying subsets of mononuclear inflammatory cells both at the tumor centre and at the invasive front  which seem to be associated with the occurrence of distant metastasis . 
 intratumour leucocytes from peripheral blood penetrate the tumor architecture after their phenotypic modification  from the invasive front to the tumor centre . 
 this seems to be a dynamic process in which inflammatory cells and immunomodulatory mediators present in the tumor microenvironment polarize the host immune response towards specific phenotypes impacting on tumor progression . 
 previously  there were six recognized hallmarks of cancer  namely  unlimited replicative potential  self - sufficiency in growth signals  insensitivity to growth inhibitors  evasion of programmed cell death  ability to develop blood vessels  and tissue invasion and metastasis . 
 a group of cytokine proteins  including il-1  il-6  tnf-  and rankl  activate inflammation and are known to augment tumor cells ' ability to metastasize by affecting several steps in the cells ' dissemination and implantation at secondary sites [ 29  32  33 ] . 
 inflammatory cytokines lie downstream of the  master  gene transcription factor nf-b  for promoting inflammation which is itself activated by them . 
 there is strong evidence that the tumor microenvironment is inflammatory and that activation of the innate immune system plays a role in the progression of cancer [ 34  35 ] . a major source of inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment  are specialized white blood cells called macrophages . 
 tumor - associated macrophages assist the malignant behaviour of tumor cells  not only by producing cytokines  but also by secreting growth factors and matrix - degrading enzymes [ 3638 ] . 
 it has long been suggested that there may be common pathways of inflammation shared by responses to infection and to malignancy . 
 recent evidence indicates that tlrs on macrophages may be critical elements in these common pathways . 
 myd88 has been reported to activate not only ap-1 and nf-b subunit p65 and p50  but also c - rel  c / ebp  and c / ebp. in case of lps signaling through tlr4  where nf-b and ap-1 activities are relatively preserved in myd88-deficient macrophages  the specific defect in c - rel and the profound defect in c / ebp/ activation likely accounts for the reduction of il-12 p40  il-6  and tnf. the absence of both c / ebp/ specifically in tlr signaling impairs key proinflammatory cytokines without affecting other nf-b - dependent genes such as ib . 
 toll - like receptors are expressed on cells of the immune system but there is growing evidence that tlrs are also expressed on tumor cells  where they may influence tumor growth and host immune responses . 
 activation of tlrs expressed on tumor cells may have profound consequences for tumor growth by factors released after tlr activation . 
 tumor immune evasion may be facilitated by inhibitory cytokines  inflammatory factors  proteinases  and other small molecules such as nitric oxide . 
 recent evidence suggests that tlrs also contribute to tumor - cell resistance to apoptosis and increased invasiveness . 
 the human breast cancer cell line mda - mb-231 was found to express tlr1-tlr10 at both the mrna and protein levels . 
 knockdown of tlr4 gene in mda - mb-231 resulted in a dramatic reduction of breast cancer cell viability and inhibition of il-6 and il-8 cytokines compared with vector control . 
 another study highlights the role of tlr9 in highly invasive mda - mb-231 breast cancer cell line which when activated promotes mda - mb-231 cell invasion by increasing the activity of matrix metalloproteinase 13 ( mmp13 )  but not mmp8 . 
 samples of mammary carcinomas with recurrence have also exhibited a significant increase in the mrna levels of tlr3  tlr4  and tlr9 . 
 a significant percentage of tumors also showed tlr4 expression by mononuclear inflammatory cells ( 21.6% ) and tlr9 expression by fibroblast - like cells ( 57.5% ) . 
 tumors with high tlr3 expression by tumor cell or with high tlr4 expression by mononuclear inflammatory cells ( mics )  but not tlr9 high fibroblast like cells were significantly associated with higher probability of metastasis . 
 this study highlights the importance of the tumor stromal cells in tumor behavior  and how tlr - induced inflammation on inflammatory cells drives metastatic cascade . 
 synthetic tlr9-ligands ( cpg - sequence containing oligonucleotides ) stimulated tlr9 expressed on cancer cells as well as various normal cells  including mesenchymal stem cells and stimulated their invasion in vitro . 
 this invasion was mediated via downregulation of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 ( timp-3 ) and through matrix metalloproteinase-13 ( mmp-13 ) activation . 
 expression of tlr9 isoforms a and b have been detected in clinical breast cancer specimens . 
 expression of tlr9 and its invasive effects on breast cancer cells has been found to be regulated by estrogen receptor- ( er ) and sex steroid hormones . 
 tlr9 expression was also found to be affected by commonly used hormonal cancer therapy bicalutamide . 
 activation of tlr signaling on tumor cells by their ligands can also trigger apoptosis and may have therapeutic effects . 
 for example  in a randomized clinical trial for the efficacy of poly ( a  :  u ) dsrna  therapeutic effect was mediated through tlr3 expressed on tumor cells  and could therefore represent an effective targeted treatment in patients with tlr3-positive cancers . 
 the predictive value of tlr3 expression by tumor cells for the efficacy of poly ( a  :  u ) dsrna was determined in 194 breast cancer patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial . 
 however  conventional chemotherapy or in vivo injection of poly ( a  :  u )  alone or in combination  failed to reduce tumor growth unless an immune - chemotherapeutic regimen of vaccination against tumor antigens was included .   recently  tlr5 has been found to be highly expressed in breast carcinomas and activation of tlr5-signaling pathway was found to be overly responsive in breast cancer cells by inhibiting cell proliferation and an anchorage - independent growth . 
 in addition  the secretion of soluble factors induced by flagellin  was found to the growth - inhibition of breast cancer cells in an autocrine fashion . 
 this inhibitory activity was further confirmed in vivo using mouse xenografts models of human breast cancer cells . 
 sites of chronic inflammation are often associated with the establishment and growth of various malignancies including breast cancer 
 . enhanced neutrophilic and granulocytic infiltration in lungs and bone of the proarthritic and arthritic mice and subsequent increase in circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines  such as macrophage colony stimulating factor ( m - csf )  interleukin-17 ( il-17 )  interleukin-6 ( il-6 )  vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf )  and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) were found to contribute to the increased metastasis . 
 breast cancer - associated secondary metastasis was found to be significantly increased in pro - arthritic and arthritic conditions . 
 breast cancer metastasis was found to be significantly reduced by blocking the il-17 and cox-2 pathway . 
 inflammatory tlr signaling has also been shown to promote the attraction and generation of th17 cells induced by tumor cells and tumor - derived fibroblasts . 
 enhanced migration of th17 cells to tumor sites was reported to be due to the expression of chemokines and tumor - derived fibroblasts . 
 there are currently approximately twenty drugs in preclinical development  with a further dozen or so in clinical trials . 
 there are clearly many options for the targeting of tlrs  because the key function of tlrs is to induce cytokines  which are well validated in these diseases and are successfully being targeted in the clinic . 
 tlrs occur early in pathways and so inhibiting them might be more potent than inhibiting their downstream cytokine targets . 
 are a feasible option  but only for those on the cell surface  such as tlr2  tlr4  and tlr5 . 
 small - molecule antagonists ( e.g.  eritoran against tlr4 or odn - based inhibitors of tlr7 ) might be a better prospect  but it is hard to predict their off - target effects and efficacy . because there are kinases on the signaling pathways  these might also be sensitive to inhibition . 
 one major concern here  however  is that such inhibitors might block multiple tlrs and therefore give rise to unwanted immunosuppression . 
 studies on knockout mouse indicate that there is less redundancy in tlrs in relation to inflammation . 
 imiquimod is already approved for its antiviral effects  whereas mpl is approved as a vaccine adjuvant . in terms of antagonism  effects of tlr inhibitor  eritoran have been found to be significant but somewhat marginal .   to further develop more effective tlr therapeutic targeting strategy  there are a few more tasks : further identifying and determining the pathogenesis of challenging medical conditions like cancer ; analysis of genetic sequence  molecular structure  epigenetic observations  and functional activities on both animal model and human clinical studies ; design of clinical study based on study indication  dosing regimens  drug delivery route or format consideration  and pharmacokinetics ; timely and objective assessment of adverse events with details . 
 targeting tlrs will therefore in all likelihood prevent the induction of many immune and inflammatory proteins . 
 the wide tissue distribution of tlrs  however  may make it difficult to determine whether an agonist or an antagonist will be most effective therapeutically . 
 metastasis is regulated not only by intrinsic genetic changes in malignant cells  but also by the microenvironment . 
 several studies have demonstrated that sites of chronic inflammation are often associated with the establishment and growth of various malignancies . 
 toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) have emerged as sensors that can detect a variety of invading pathogens and malignant cells . since their discovery a decade ago  tlrs have been shown to be critical for efficient innate and adaptive immunity and the framework of tlr - mediated signaling pathway has been explained . 
 however  tlr activation may be a two - edged sword  with both antitumor and pro - tumor consequences . 
 the general expression of functionally active tlrs by tumor cells and inflammatory cells in the stroma by putative endogenous ligands suggests that tlr signaling may be continually activated and may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis . 
 understanding tlr function in tumor biology may lead to discovery of new therapeutic targets in cancer therapy ."," 

1) Abstract: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been identified as potential targets for breast cancer treatment due to their role in promoting inflammation and cell survival in the tumor microenvironment. This paper examines how TLR signaling can contribute to tumor progression and immune escape, making it a promising area for future research.

2) Research and Discussion: The expression of TLRs on breast cancer cells and mononuclear inflammatory cells has been linked to chronic inflammation and the development of mammary tumors. This review discusses the mechanisms through which TLRs promote angiogenesis, metastasis, and immune suppression, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets for breast cancer.

3) Results and Conclusion: Targeting TLR signaling in breast cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment has the potential to improve treatment outcomes and reduce mortality rates for women with breast cancer. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of TLRs in breast cancer development and progression, but the evidence suggests that they hold promise for the future of breast cancer therapy."
"forensic odontology has established itself as an important and often indispensible science in medicolegal matters and identification of the dead . 
 the forensic importance of dental tissue has been well recognized because tooth is the hardest of all human tissues . 
 they are well preserved for a long period even after death  hence dental remains are the most stable biological evidence encountered in crime cases and yield useful information . 
 blood grouping has been one of the major factors for identification of biological materials in forensic investigations and is a widely used technique in forensic laboratories . 
 the presence of abo blood group and rhesus factor is applied to inherited antigens detected on red cell surface by specific antibodies . 
 once the blood group and rhesus factor are established  it remains unchanged throughout life . 
 kind in 1960 discovered the presence of abo blood group in saliva by absorption - elution ( ae ) method . 
 blood grouping from dried stain by elution procedure was described more than 50 years ago but not employed widely in forensic serology  until 1960  when kind refined this technique . 
 ae technique / procedure originally devised by siracusa is now employed in all forensic laboratories because it is proven to be most sensitive  reliable and reproducible . 
 pulp tissue is one of the most protected tissues being surrounded from all sides by dental hard tissues . 
 pulp contains numerous blood vessels and blood group antigens are certainly present in tooth pulp . 
 the distribution of abo substances from the pulp cavity wall to the dentin edge and the enamel gradually reduces  because of fewer possibilities of diffusion of antigens from both blood and saliva . 
 the existence of blood group antigens in tooth dentin and enamel and their nature has been substantiated by infusion  sedimentation phenomena combined with inherently present antigens . 
 this theory describes the infusion of water - soluble antigens from saliva into the tooth tissue . 
 the presence of abo blood group and rhesus factor antigen in soft and hard dental tissues makes a possible contribution in human identification even in decomposed bodies . 
 therefore  blood group and rhesus factor determination for biological evidence on tooth material is of great importance in forensic odontology . 
 the aim of this study was to determine the abo blood grouping and rhesus factor from dentin and pulp of extracted teeth using  ae technique  at 0  3  6  9 and 12 months after extraction . 
 a brief case history with relevant medical history was recorded from patients selected for study and consent was taken . 
 the blood groups were determined for all the study participants using capillary blood by slide agglutination method . 
 carious teeth and grossly decayed teeth were excluded ; and teeth extracted for periodontal  and orthodontic purposes were included in the study . 
 the extraction procedure was carried out under local anesthesia following the aseptic protocol in the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery . 
 the extracted teeth were dried and stored in labeled bottles for a span of 3  6  9 and 12 months . 
 the pulp was scooped with a spoon excavator and dentin was powdered using a straight fissure bur [ figure 1 ] . 
 the blood grouping from teeth was performed by ae technique using powdered dentin and dental pulp . 
 the pulverized dentin powder and pulp were divided into three equal parts and were taken into six sterile test tubes containing 2 ml of saline and labeled  respectively . to each of these test tubes  three drops of antiserum a  b  
 d was added respectively  and the test samples were sufficiently soaked with antiserum for 2 h and left standing at room temperature . 
 each sample was washed five times with cold saline solution by centrifuging it at 3000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was removed with pipette . then 
 two drops of fresh saline were added to the sample  and the test tubes were heated in a water bath at a temperature of 5055c for 10 min to elude the antibodies . 
 ( a ) dissected teeth samples  ( b ) pulverized dentine and ( c ) dried pulp tissue a drop of 0.5% red cell suspension of known blood group a  b and o was freshly prepared and immediately put into respective test tubes . 
 the samples were incubated at 37c for 30 min to enhance agglutination  and then  it was centrifuged at 15002000 rpm for 1 min . by gentle 
 shaking of the test tube  the presence or absence of red cell agglutination was ascertained macroscopically and microscopically at a magnification of 4 [ figures 2 and 3 ] . 
 macroscopic observation of the agglutination in dentin ( l ) and pulp ( r ) samples microscopic observation of the agglutination in dentin ( l  unstained  x100 ) and pulp ( r  unstained  x400 ) samples ( 4 ) data were analyzed in proportion . 
 for comparison  chi - square test or fisher 's exact test was used for small sample . 
 two - tailed p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant  and 0.01 was considered as highly statistically significant . 
 data were analyzed in proportion . for comparison  chi - square test or fisher 's exact test was used for small sample . two - tailed 
 p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant  and 0.01 was considered as highly statistically significant . 
 abo blood grouping for dentin and pulp showed a gradual decrease in the sensitivity as the time period increased . in dentine  
 the sensitivity ranged from 100% to 73% and pulp sensitivity ranged from 100% to 80% . 
 there was no significant difference in the sensitivities of dentin and pulp [ table 1 ] . 
 abo blood grouping for pulp and dentine rh factor grouping for dentin and pulp showed a gradual decrease in the sensitivity as the time period increased up to 9 months . 
 in dentine  the sensitivity ranged from 100% to 40% and pulp sensitivity ranged from 100% to 23% . 
 overall pulp showed better sensitivity than dentin except at 12 months time period where dentin showed better sensitivity than pulp . 
 moreover  in comparison with the sensitivities of dentin and pulp  the p values obtained were not significant [ table 2 ] . 
 rh factor blood grouping for pulp and dentine when compared the sensitivity of abo and rh factor blood grouping of dentin and pulp in accordance to time period dentin and pulp showed almost similar results from 0 to 9 months . at 12 months 
 both dentin and pulp showed vast difference in the sensitivities of abo and rh blood grouping with significant p value [ table 3 ] . 
 comparison of abo and rh factor blood grouping for dentin and pulp the overall mean sensitivity of dentin for abo blood grouping is 88% and for rh factor  blood grouping is 79%  with a significant p = 0.03 . 
 the overall mean sensitivity of pulp for abo blood grouping is 90% and for rh factor  blood grouping is 82% with a significant p = 0.04 . 
 dentin and pulp showed the p = 0.58 for abo blood grouping and 0.46 for rh factor blood grouping [ table 4 and figure 4 ] . 
 overall comparison of blood group systems and teeth components graph of comparisons of the overall sensitivity of abo and rh factor blood grouping of dentin and pulp 
 lattes have rightly said  the fact that belonging to a definite blood group is a fixed character of every human being and can be altered neither by lapse of time nor by intercurrent disease . 
 human identification is the mainstay of civilization  and the identification of unknown individuals has always been of paramount importance to society . 
 the use of blood group substances in medico - legal examination is grounded on the fact that once a blood group is established in an individual  it remains unchanged for a lifetime . for several decades  
 the technique ae is the most sensitive and the most widely employed . according to kind  
 nickolls and periera and outtridge  ae has proved to be markedly more sensitive than the absorption - inhibition test . ae has shown more success rate than mixed - agglutination for certain antigens . 
 rh blood group is considered to be the most complex genetically of all the blood type systems since it involves 45 different antigens on the surface of red cell . 
 teeth are used for blood grouping and are considered as a hallmark for identification of biological materials in forensic investigations . 
 considering this fact in our present study  an attempt was made to detect abo and rh factor antigen from dentin and pulp over a time period of 0  3  6  9 and 12 months . 
 for abo blood grouping  both dentin and pulp showed 100% sensitivity with the samples tested immediately after extraction and the sensitivity gradually reduced as time period prolonged . 
 pulp showed better sensitivity than dentin but the difference was statistically insignificant  suggesting both dentin and pulp have almost equal antigenic potential although pulp is better  the sensitivity weakened as the time period increased . till date  the various studies conducted by smeets et al .  shetty and premlata  ballal and david and ramnarayan et al . at different time period showed pulp to be better tool than dentin and there was a decrease in the sensitivity of the dentin and pulp as the time periods increased . 
 the overall decrease in the sensitivity could be due to dehydration  the loss of pulp antigens  insufficient quantity of pulp  calcification of the canals  cell lysis ; contamination of the tooth or time lapse for the procedure . for rh factor blood grouping  both dentin and pulp showed 100% sensitivity when the samples were tested immediately after extraction and the sensitivity gradually reduced as time period prolonged . 
 pulp showed better results than dentine  but the difference was statistically insignificant  suggesting both dentin and pulp have almost equal antigenic potential which weakened as the time period increased  similar to abo antigens . 
 this may be attributed to autolysis  dehydration and the loss of pulp antigens similar to abo antigens . 
 is the only study available in english language literature that was conducted for determination of rh factor antigens along with abo blood group antigens in freshly obtained pulp samples . in our study  
 both pulp and dentin samples were used and tested at 0 month to an extensive time period of 12 months . 
 abo and rh factor blood grouping for dentin and pulp showed a gradual decrease in the sensitivity as the time period increased . at 12 months  
 both dentin and pulp showed a drastic decrease in the sensitivity for rh factor blood grouping than the abo blood grouping with a statistically significant difference . 
 the sensitivity of pulp was better than dentin in both the blood grouping systems with an insignificant p value . 
 abo blood grouping was better than rh factor grouping in both the teeth components and the p values obtained were significant . 
 this indicates that the antigenicity of pulp is better than dentin in both abo and rh blood groups  and abo antigens were better expressed than rh factor blood group antigens . 
 the outcome of our study showed that abo and rh blood group antigens could be detected up to 12 months  and there are no studies in the english literature to compare this study . 
 this shows that pulp contains more amounts of antigen than the dentin and its antigenicity decreases with time . 
 blood grouping on teeth is not a straight forward technique ; the concentrations of blood group antigens are low in the teeth when compared to other tissues and body fluids . in this study  
 it is assumed that the origin of blood group antigen in dental hard tissue is based on the infusion sedimentation phenomenon combined with inherently present antigens . 
 considering all the factors that support the presence of blood group antigens in dentin and pulp and also the pitfalls of false positive result or mistyping of blood group  over a period in this study  we came to a close consequence that the results obtained with pulp were better than that of dentine . 
 another aspect to be highlighted here is abo and rh factor antigens were detected from both dentin and pulp even up to 12 months after extraction of the teeth . 
 blood grouping has been one of the bases for identification of biological materials in forensic investigations and abo blood grouping is a widely used technique in forensic laboratories . 
 the presence of abo blood group antigens along with rh factor antigens in pulp and hard dental tissues makes it a potential substance in the identification of highly decomposed bodies or body part where teeth and bones are the only significant tissue remains . 
 blood group substances in the hard dental tissues thus remain unaffected even in adverse environmental conditions . 
 teeth were used as a mode of identification of blood group in this study because teeth are one of the most indestructible parts of the body and exhibit the least turnover of natural structure . 
 the presence of abo blood group and rh factor antigen in soft and hard tissue makes it possible for identification of the deceased . 
 ae test to identify blood groups in teeth may be of immense value not only in the identification of accused but also in the investigation of mass disaster and fire victims . on the basis of results obtained in our study  both dentin and pulp are reliable sources of blood group determination for upto 12 months for abo and rh factor blood grouping  especially where teeth ensues to be the only remnants existing for individual identity . 
 although expression of abo blood groups and rh factor was seen in both dentin and pulp  intensity of abo blood groups and rh factor was higher in pulp than dentin and abo blood group antigens were better expressed than rh factor antigens in both dentin and pulp . 
 blood group determination from teeth warrants advance exploration as the establishment of identification of a person from the skeletal remains is of paramount importance to a forensic odontologist . till date  in english language literature no studies have been conducted to detect abo and rh factor blood group antigens from tooth material for up to 12 months . 
 this study detected blood groups antigens of abo and rh systems from tooth material over this extensive time period of 12 months . 
 this study is thus a quantum of what has been known and learned and how much more needs to be understood in this challenging branch of forensic odontology .

Abstract: This study aimed to determine blood groups and rhesus factor using dentin and pulp samples at different time periods. 150 cases were tested and data was analyzed using chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Results showed a gradual decrease in sensitivity as time period increased and higher sensitivity in pulp samples compared to dentin.

Research and Discussion: The study included 150 cases with patients aged 13-60 years. Dentin and pulp samples were tested for abo/rh antigen using the ae technique at different time periods. Results showed a decrease in antigenicity over time, with better detection of abo antigens compared to rh antigens. The sensitivity of pulp was also found to be higher than dentin for both blood grouping systems.

Results and Conclusion: The study found that abo and rh antigens can be detected in dentin and pulp samples up to 12 months. However, sensitivity decreased as time period increased. Results of both systems showed similar trends with no statistical significance between dentin and pulp samples. Abo blood grouping showed higher sensitivity and a statistically significant result compared to rh factor blood grouping. "
"cystic echinococcosis ( ce ) is a severe zoonosis caused by the cyclophyllidean cestode echinococcus granulosus . 
 the disease has a worldwide distribution  with endemic regions in many countries of the mediterranean basin  north and east africa  western and central asia  china  south america  and australia [ 1  2 ] . 
 although the distribution of echinococcus granulosus is considered worldwide  it is higher in developing countries in tropics and subtropics  especially in rural communities where there is close contact between dogs and various domestic animals . in some western countries  ce is considered as a reemerging zoonosis due to its resurging prevalence [ 4  5 ] . 
 the worldwide distribution of the disease is partly due to the easy adaptability of the parasite to several domestic and wild intermediate hosts . clinically  there are three broad morphological forms of echinococcosis that are recognized : cystic echinococcosis caused by e. granulosus  alveolar echinococcosis caused by e. multilocularis  and polycystic echinococcosis caused by e. vogeli and e. oligathrus [ 79 ] . 
 the  sheep  strain ( defined as g l on mitochondrial genotypic grounds ) is generally considered as the most widespread strain of e. granulosus in the world and the one mainly involved in ce in humans . 
 at least five out of ten strains of e. granulosus strains ( g 1 to g 10 ) have been found to be infective to humans in sub - saharan africa . 
  disease consequences may include poor quality of life ( disability adjusted life years ( dalys ) )  costs of medical treatment  lost opportunity for income generation  and mortality in some cases   while in animals there is reduced productivity and monetary losses due to abattoir condemnations of organs [ 14  15 ] . 
 the dalys for human cystic echinococcosis was recently estimated to be more than that for onchocerciasis and almost the same as that for africa trypanosomiasis . 
 the annual ce - associated economic losses on a global basis have been recently estimated to be at least over us$2 billion . in zambia  like in most sub - saharan africa  echinococcosis has been reported in many parts of the country  although not much information is currently available making it one of the neglected tropical diseases . in western province of zambia  hydatid cysts 
 are reported to have been diagnosed from cattle carcasses during meat inspection although most of these reports are inconclusive . 
 however  there has been no comprehensive study carried out thus far to describe echinococcosis infections in both the intermediate and final hosts and also to determine the economic and public health significance . based on circumstantial evidence 
  it is assumed that the disease has serious public health and socioeconomic implications given the interactions that exist between cattle  dogs  and humans and also the uncontrolled disposal of abattoir waste and remains from animal slaughters . however  this assertion needed to be supported by well - structured studies . 
 the aim of this study therefore was to determine the prevalence of hydatidosis in cattle presented for slaughter at abattoirs in western province of zambia and assess economic losses due to organ condemnation using a cross - sectional epidemiological survey with the view to identifying intervention measures aimed at reducing transmission of the disease between humans and different animals hosts . 
 the study was conducted in western province of zambia from october 2007 to november 2008 . 
 western province lies between longitudes 22 degrees and 25 degrees east and latitude 13 degrees 30  mins and 17 degrees 45  mins south . 
 the province covers an area of 126386  km  which represents about 17% of the total land surface of zambia which covers 752000  km ( figure 1 ) . 
 about 10% ( 12950  km ) of the total land area consists of a vast sandy upland . 
 the province has a dry and cold winters ( april to july )  hot and dry season ( august to october )  and hot and wet summers ( november to march ) . 
 the annual flooding of the zambezi plains controls the pattern of life for the people and livestock in western province with people practice transhumant subsistence livelihood . 
 thus  during flooding  the largest population of cattle and people are concentrated along the edges of the plains . 
 western province has a cattle population of approximately 452400  making it one of the largest cattle producing areas in zambia  while the dog population is estimated at 65315 with mongu having highest number of dogs at 16210 followed by kalabo ( 13496 )  shangombo ( 11732 )  sesheke ( 8638 )  kaoma ( 6254 )  senanga ( 4750 )  and lukulu ( 4236 ) . 
 dogs  generally  belong to specific households where feeding is supplemented but often have the freedom to roam and scavenge in the neighbourhood . 
 all cattle are slaughtered within the province  mostly in mongu and senanga abattoirs  due to a movement ban imposed in 1998 as a result of the outbreak of contagious bovine pleural pneumonia ( cbpp ) . 
 therefore  data obtained from cattle that are slaughtered in mongu is a good representation of the true provincial picture . 
 the study was conducted as a two - tier study involving a prospective abattoir survey and a retrospective review of meat inspection reports at zambeef and starbeef abattoirs in mongu . 
 a retrospective study was carried out based on a review of postmortem reports findings during meat inspection at the abattoirs in the last eleven years ( 19942007 ) . 
 data was obtained from district veterinary offices and abattoir reports on meat inspection and movement of livestock carried out in the previous 11 years in western province . 
 information collected included number of cattle slaughtered  breed and type of organs condemned  number and weight of condemned organs . 
 the aim of this was to provide baseline information and a retrospective understanding of the prevalence  dynamics and spatial distribution of the disease in western province and also to estimate the annual economic loss due to organ condemnation . 
 this study was conducted between october 2007 and october 2008 at zambeef and starbeef abattoirs in mongu district . 
 cattle that were slaughtered at the two abattoirs were sourced from all the seven districts of western province except sesheke district . 
 all 4061 cattle that were slaughtered during the study period were included in the survey . 
 the slaughtered cattle were subjected to thorough postmortem inspection and lesioned organs were identified and samples were collected . 
 prior to commencement of the prospective study  meat inspectors at the two slaughterhouses underwent an in - house refresher training in recognition of hydatid cysts in various organs of the carcasses according to the procedures recommended by fao / unep / who ( 1994 ) . 
 each animal that was slaughtered was uniquely identified using stock movement permits that included the veterinary camp of origin in the district and further information was obtained by interviewing the owner . 
 the age of the animals was obtained by interviewing the owners in cases where the ultimate owner brought the cattle ; otherwise the age was estimated using dentition as described by jenkins . 
 visceral organs including lungs  liver  heart  spleen  and kidneys were examined  through visual observation  palpation and systematic incision in each carcass according to procedures recommended by fao / unep / who ( 1994 ) . 
 hydatid cysts where identified through visual inspection and palpation of organs during meat inspection and enumerated . 
 a sample of hydatid cysts during inspection was removed whole and collected in polythene bags . 
 a separate polythene bag was used for hydatid cysts obtained from one animal and was uniquely labelled and stored in ice before transportation  within one hour  to mongu regional laboratory for viability determination . 
 cattle were classified as positive for hydatidosis if it was found with one or more hydatid cysts in any of the internal organs .   at mongu regional laboratory  
 the collected cysts were individually grossly examined for degeneration and calcification as described by oostburg et al . . 
 the cyst wall was carefully incised with a scalpel blade and the contents poured into a petri dish . 
 the contents were examined under a microscope ( 40x magnification ) for the presence of protoscoleces . the germinal layer was also put in glycerine and placed between two microscopic glass slides and examined for the presence of protoscoleces . 
 cysts that did not contain protoscoleces contained pus or were calcified were considered as sterile or not viable . 
 further  the viability of the protoscolices was checked under the microscope using the dye exclusion principle after staining with 0.1% eosin stain for 15 minutes . 
 the protoscolices that took up the stain were classified as dead while those that did not were considered to be alive and viable [ 18  19 ] . 
 the loss attributed to condemnations of offal due to echinococcus was determined using a modification of the formula as described by yamene ( 1990 ) cited by getaw et al . . 
 this was on the basis of the average price of wholesome and intact visceral organs obtained from zambeef and starbeef abattoirs mongu . 
 data was stored in microsoft excel spread and transferred to stata statistical packages version 10 ( stata corp . 
 infections in cattle for both prospective and retrospective data was determined as proportion of the test - positive subjects against the total number tested . 
 apparent prevalence estimates were converted into true prevalence values by taking into account the sensitivity and specificity of the test methods as described in dohoo ( 2003 ) . 
 the annual economic loss as a result of condemned organ was estimated by taking into account the average number of cattle slaughtered per annum at the zambeef and starbeef abattoir and the percentage of condemned organs using the following formula described by yemane ( 1990 ) as cited by getaw et al . . 
 ( 1)annual  loss=(npsiluclu)+(npsilicli)+(npsiheche)+(npsikicki )  
 where nps : total number of positive animal slaughter  ilu : prevalence of lung hydatidosis  ili : prevalence of liver hydatidosis  ihe : prevalence of heart hydatidosis  iki : prevalence of kidney hydatidosis  clu : cost of lung  cli : cost of liver  che : cost of heart  and cki : cost of kidney . 
 a retrospective study was carried out based on a review of postmortem report findings during meat inspection at the abattoirs over a period of eleven years from 1994 to 2007 ( with exemption of 1997  1998  and 2002 where data was missing ) . during this period  158 
  456 bovines were slaughtered and inspected  and 4689 cases of bovine hydatidosis were recorded ( table 2 ) . 
 the overall combined prevalence of bovine echinococcosis during the period under review was estimated at 3.0% ( table 1 ) which was close to prevalence observed in our prospective study . 
 annual prevalence ranged from the lowest at 1.56% ( n = 12641 ) in 2006 to the highest at 4.7% ( n = 2633 ) in 2001 . 
 a review of the postmortem records over an eleven year period revealed that the distribution of hydatid cysts in bovine was highest in lung at 93.47% ( 95% ci : 92.7594.14 ) followed by liver at 6.55% ( 95% ci : 5.887.29 ) and spleen with the lowest at 0.02% ( 95% ci : 0.000.12 ) prevalence . 
 a total of 4061 cattle from mongu ( n = 2441 )  senanga ( n = 577 )  kalabo ( n = 653 )  lukulu ( n = 335 )  shangombo ( n = 47 )  and kaoma ( n = 8) were slaughtered at the zambeef and starbeef abattoirs between october 2007 and november 2008 . out of this  84 ( 2.1% ) carcasses ( table 3 ) were diagnosed positive for hydatidosis during postmortem inspections . there was variation in prevalence of hydatidosis according to the district of origin  where cattle coming from mongu had the highest prevalence of cyst positive cases ( 2.5% ) compared to senanga ( 2.1% )  kalabo ( 1.4% )  and lukulu ( 0.6% ) ( table 3 ) . 
 sex was found to be positively associated with hydatidosis ( p = 0.035 ) with female cattle being more likely to test positive than males ( odds ratio = 1.62 ) . on the other hand  
 hydatidosis was independent of age ( p = 0.31 ) where the mean age among the positives was 7.8 years ( range : 7.47.6 ) and that among the negatives was 7.5 years ( range : 7.38.3 ) . in terms of distribution of hydatid cysts by organ  51.2% 
 were found in lungs  47.6% were in livers  while 1.2% were in the kidneys . 
 mukukutu camp in senanga district accounted for the highest prevalence at 4.0% ( 95% ci 3.811.8% )  while lukulu central camp in lukulu district had the lowest prevalence at 0.3% ( 95% ci 0.20.9% ) . on comparison of camps in different districts 
  it was observed that in mongu  the highest prevalence of bovine hydatidosis was in limulunga veterinary camp at 2.9% ( 95% ci 1.44.4% ) with the lowest prevalence in luandui camp at 1.5% ( 95% ci 0.53.7% ) . in senanga district  
 the highest prevalence was in mukukutu camp at 4.0% ( 95% ci 3.811.8% ) and the lowest was mouyo camp at 1.6% ( 95% ci 0.043.2% ) . in kalabo district  
 the highest prevalence was observed in sikongo camp at 3.3% ( 95% ci 1.28.0% ) . in lukulu district  
 the highest prevalence was in mbanga camp at 1.8% ( 95% ci 1.75.3% ) and lowest in lukulu central camp at 0.3% ( 95% ci 0.20.9% ) . 
 the overall median number of cysts in an organ was 6 ( range 221 )  in the lungs the median was 6 ( range 221 )  and liver the median was 4 ( range ; 35 ) . 
 the number of hydatid cysts that were examined in the lung was 108 while in the liver it was 16 . 
 the lung had a highest density of cysts per organ compared to the liver ( table 4 ) . 
 there was no significant difference in viability rate of hydatid cysts recovered from the lung ( 43.5% ) and in liver ( 43.8% ) . 
 the prices used in the estimation of annual economic loss from condemned organs  were the 2011 average prices for wholesome and intact visceral organs obtained from zambeef butchery in mongu . while the average weights of the various organs were calculated from the data obtained from the abattoir prospective study . 
 the average weight of a lung was estimated at 2.92  kg  liver and spleen were 3.34  kg and 2.00  kg  respectively . 
 the average cost of lung was zmk ( zambian kwacha ) 12000 per kg  liver zmk 18000 per kg  and spleen zmk 12000 . 
 the cost of one lung = average weight  cost / kg ( 2.92 @ 12000 ) = zmk 35040 ; cost of liver = average weight  cost / kg ( 3.34 @ 18000 ) = zmk 60120 ; cost of spleen= average weight  cost / kg ( 2 @ 12000 ) = zmk24  000  average annual slaughter= 14405 . 
 in this study  we investigated the prevalence of hydatidosis based on pm findings at two abattoirs in western province of zambia . 
 it is therefore noted that the prevalence estimates provided here may have some bias as abattoir sample populations is not always representative of the reference populations where animals are drawn . 
 this is often so because animals brought for slaughters are those that are old or out of production . considering the reduced sensitivity of pm inspection - based diagnosis  
 there is always a possibility that some positive cases were missed resulting in underreporting the actual disease burden . despite these short - comings  
 abattoir survey data is routinely used to estimate disease burden because of easy feasibility of conducting abattoir surveys compared to field surveys based on random study designs . 
 besides  abattoir data provides opportunity for developing intervention strategies by timely diagnosis and condemning carcasses infected with zoonoses likely to enter the food chain . 
 the observed prevalence of hydatid cysts in cattle sampled at the two abattoirs in mongu was found to be low ( 2.1% ) and was comparable to that observed during the retrospective survey ( 3.0% ) . 
 furthermore  the findings in this study were in agreement with that observed in a study done in sudan which reported a prevalence of 3% in cattle . in arusha tanzania  a study by nonga and karimuribo reported a prevalence of 4.2% in cattle . similarly  
 for instance  rkia azlaf and allal dakkak reported prevalence of 23.0% bovine hydatidosis in morocco   and so did kebede in ethiopia who reported a prevalence of 22.1% . 
 in our study  the distribution of hydatidosis varied according to district with mongu reporting the highest prevalence compared to other districts . 
 the reason for the high prevalence in mongu could be attributed to a high numbers of cattle and dog populations coupled with a high number of home slaughters during ceremonies  which in some cases are not inspected by the veterinary department staff . 
 there is an increased dog and cattle interaction due to high populations and free range rearing of cattle which are often herded by boys with dogs ; this increases contact of cattle with dog faeces . 
 further  dog access to slaughterhouse waste in mongu abattoirs is likely to increase exposure of both cattle and dogs in the district . 
 sex was found to be positively associated with hydatidosis ( p = 0.035 ) with female cattle being more likely to test positive than males . 
  in iran  who observed that the prevalence was higher in females than males . 
 there was a significant difference in the prevalence of hydatid cysts between carcasses slaughtered in 2007 and 2008 ( p = 0.024 )  where prevalence of bovine hydatidosis in 2007 was 1.3% ( 95% ci : 0.691.93 ) and in 2008 was 2.4% ( 95% ci : 1.82.9 ) . 
 this could be as a result of more animals coming from areas of higher prevalence of bovine hydatidosis such as mongu and senanga in 2008 than in 2007 . 
 however  this could not be fully ascertained due to absence of trace back information during the period under review . 
 the lung was found to be the most affected organ ( 51.2% ) compared to the liver ( 47.6% ) and the kidney ( 1.2% ) . 
 this is in agreement with what was reported by getaw et al .   who observed that the lung had a higher prevalence at 55.2% and the liver at 37.1% while the kidney was the least affacted organ . 
 the results are also in agreement with findings by cadmus and adesokan ( 2009 ) in nigeria  and kebede et al .   who did their study in ethiopia . however  our results are at odds with the findings from a study conducted in libya where researchers reported higher prevalence in the liver than in the lung   and al - khalid ( 1998 ) cited by dakkak   who showed that in libya  75% of the positive bovine hydatidosis cases were in the liver and 37.5% in the lung and 12.5% in the spleen . 
 the reason why the lung and liver are mostly affected could be due to the fact that the lungs and livers are the first capillary beds encountered by migrating echinococcus oncospheres via the portal vein route before any other peripheral organs . 
 the lungs however have a larger capillary bed than any other organs and this could account for the observed higher prevalence than seen in the other organs . in humans  however  the liver is most commonly affected . 
 the explanation to this differences in the predirection sites between cattle and human is beyond the scope of this study . 
 cysts viability study revealed that the overall percentage of viable cyst in this study was 43.5% which is comparable to findings by other researchers like ibrahim   who found cyst viability of 47.8% in sheep and 24% in goats . 
  who did not observe any viable cyst from their survey and berhe   who found a lower viability rate of 10.7% in cattle in tigray region of ethiopia . the possible reason why no viable cysts were observed by rinaldi et al 
 .   could be due to the differences in immunological responses by different individual hosts or deworming of the animals by use of antihelmintics .   out of a total of 19 hydatid cyst infested organs that were investigated ( 15 lungs and 4 livers ) for cyst fertility  viability  and density 
  it was found that the lung had a higher average density of cysts infestation ( 7 cysts per lung ) ( table 4 ) while the liver had a low hydatid cyst density ( 4 cysts per liver ) . 
 this was however different from findings by ibrahim   in saudi arabia who observed that the liver had a higher cyst density . 
 the difference in the cyst density could mainly be attributed to the higher vascularisation of lung tissue compared to liver . 
 the other reason in the difference in cyst density could be as a result of the soft texture of the lung tissue in comparison to liver  which has a harder texture thus restricting hydatid cyst development . 
 the number of hydatid cysts that were examined in the lung was 108 while in the liver was 16 . 
 most of the dead cysts in the liver were found to be calcified compared to the lung . 
  kebede et al .  and berhe   who reported a higher fertility rate of pulmonary and lower fertility rate in hepatic cysts . 
 this could probably be due to the various metabolic reactions that take place in the liver as compared to lungs . 
 however ibrahim   found a higher fertility rate in liver at 38.8% than in the lung at 25.1% and so did dalimi et al .   who reported a higher fertility rate in the liver than in the lung . 
 the high percentage of viable cysts indicates that there is a high risk of dog exposure in situations where offal are carelessly disposed of and dogs have access to the infected offal  like the situation is in western province of zambia . 
 this points to a possible intervention area in which dogs should be prevented from ingesting infected with cysts such as the lungs and liver . in this study  
 the annual economic loss as a result of condemnation of organs due to bovine hydatidosis was low at k 15  894039.00.(3311 us$ ) per annum . 
 the loss was found to be low due to the low prevalence of hydatidosis in cattle in western province of zambia . 
 the total annual loss could be greater than the estimated amount bearing in mind that this only took into account direct losses and not indirect losses as a result of weight loss due to ce and other losses such as reduced milk production and reduction in reproduction in cattle . 
 the main thrust of the study was to describe the hydatidosis situation in western province so as to increase public health awareness  describe the socioeconomic impact  and to recommend possible mitigation measures . 
 it should be noted however  that echinococcosis is a disease of multiple hosts and the objective of this study could only be addressed by the application of conventional observational studies . this study has demonstrated that hydatidosis is an important disease and is endemic in western province . 
 the disease also causes considerable economic losses as a result of offal condemnations . despite the low infection rate demonstrated by the current study 
  there are certain socioeconomic conditions that are favourable for the existence of ce  and therefore ce still remains one of the most important helminth zoonotic disease hence the need for increased attention in control and prevention of the disease . 
 livestock and dog echinococcosis prevalence studies and surveillance can help map out ce risk landscape profiles that will determine communities at greatest risk to human ce 
 . a molecular analysis of human and animal hydatidosis would be desirable in order to effectively map out epidemiology of the disease and determine the spread of the disease . 
 a specific study of the disease in dogs could also help in knowing the prevalence in the definitive host . 
 wildlife species have not been shown to harbour e. granulosus in zambia . in view of the extensive livestock / wildlife interface areas in the province  
 furthermore  a study in small ruminants such as sheep and goats may improve epidemiological understanding of the disease in zambia . with the current study having been done on cattle  
 it is also suggested that in areas where there is a presence of large numbers of wildlife definitive hosts such as observed in some parts of kalabo  lukulu  and kaoma districts  increased effort should be made to sample some of the possible wildlife definitive host of echinococcus spp . 
 effort should be made to ascertain the host specificity of local strains of the parasite in respect to cattle and other domestic animals . to effectively come up with a control program  possible wildlife reservoirs  and the survival of eggs under the local climatic and soil conditions have to be investigated .","

Abstract:
This study was conducted from 2007 to 2008 to estimate the prevalence of hydatidosis in slaughtered cattle in two abattoirs in Western Province, Zambia. The overall prevalence was found to be 2.1%, with a higher prevalence in female cattle. The lungs and liver were the most commonly affected organs.

Research and Discussion:
The retrospective data collected from 1994 to 2007 showed that the prevalence of hydatidosis ranged from 1.56% to 4.7% annually. This is comparable to the prevalence observed in the more recent cross-sectional study. Hydatidosis was present in several districts, with a higher prevalence observed in some areas.

Results and Conclusion:
The study confirmed the presence of hydatidosis in cattle in Western Province, Zambia and highlighted the economic losses due to organ condemnations. Data from this study can be used to develop effective policies and interventions to control and decrease the prevalence of hydatidosis in the region."
"septic internal jugular vein - sigmoid sinus thrombosis is a rare condition that complicates local and regional infectious inflammatory processes occurring in the head and neck . 
 these include deep neck infections  lemierre syndrome  and central venous catheterization ( cvc ) or cannulation17 ) . 
 this is a life - threatening condition and prompt management is essential to decrease the potential for thrombosis - related morbidity and mortality . 
 we report a case of internal jugular vein - sigmoid sinus thrombosis due to a misplaced central venous catheter . 
 a 52-year - old woman presented with a severe bursting headache  vomiting  and a drowsy mentality . 
 brain computed tomography ( ct ) scan revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cistern with a small amount of hematoma at the left sylvian fissure ( fig . 
 we identified an aneurysmal rupture of the middle cerebral artery on the left side by cerebral catheter angiography ( fig . 
 postoperative chest x - ray was normal except for malposition of the central venous catheter in the right internal jugular vein ( fig . 
 ten days later  the patient developed a fever  elevated white blood cell count to 227000  and elevated c - reactive protein to 33.6 . 
 the central venous catheter was removed  and antibiotics were administrated through a different intravenous route . despite these managements  the patient was stupor the next day . 
 brain ct scan revealed cerebral infarction with hemorrhagic transformation in the right temporal lobe  and ct angiography did not identify vasospasm ( fig . 
 retrospective analysis of the contrast - enhanced ct scan and ct angiography showed an "" empty delta sign "" and absence of venous flow within the right internal jugular vein - sigmoid sinus that was sufficient for diagnosis of sinus thrombosis ( fig . 
 results of central venous catheter tip and blood culture was reported staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus  respectively . 
 we could not start systemic heparinization due to hemorrhagic transformation of the cerebral infarction in the right temporal lobe . 
 we administrated mannitol and steroids to manage increased intracranial pressure ; however  the patient died from severe pneumonia due to septic emboli after one week ( fig . 2c ) . 
 indications for a cvc are the intravenous administration of drugs  parenteral nutrition  hemodialysis  and hemodynamic monitoring13 ) . at many institutions  cvc 
 is routinely inserted before undergoing major surgery or treating patients with critical illnesses or cancer . 
 the most frequently available anatomical sites for cvc are the subclavian and internal jugular veins . 
 these procedures carry a substantial risk of mechanical lesions  such as arterial puncture  pneumothorax  cardiac tamponade  nerve lesions  or thrombotic or septic complications13 ) . 
 malpositioning of the catheter tip may happen more often in the subclavian vein than the internal jugular vein . 
 the reported incidence of primary misplacement of the catheter tip after infraclavicular subclavian vein catheterization varies from 5% to 24% even when inserted by experienced clinicians7 ) . 
 inadvertent catheterization of the ipsilateral internal jugular vein is one of the most common misplacements  with a reported incidence of around 7%15 ) . 
 the positioning of catheter tips within the cardiac silhouette is associated with increased risk of cardiac tamponade6 ) . 
 also  positioning of the catheter tip in the subclavian vein is associated with a high risk of thrombus formation and vessel occlusion2 ) . 
 the risk of thrombosis may increase when hyperosmolar parenteral nutrition fluid is administered through a misplaced central venous catheter into a internal jugular vein315 ) . 
 moreover  malpositioned catheter tips can damage the endothelium and precipitate the formation of thrombi17 ) . 
 when a cvc causes thrombosis  the risk of catheter - related sepsis may increase . in patients with a cvc 
  the risk of catheter - related infection was reported to range between 1% and 10%1 ) . 
 contamination of a thrombus from the skin puncture site may result in septic endophlebitis  and occasional blood - borne infections may also contaminate the thrombus . 
 embolic septic thrombi may involve the lungs and  less frequently  the joints  viscera  and brain17 ) . 
 subclavian or internal jugular vein thrombosis associated with indwelling catheters will propagate into other vessels  but extension into the intracranial sinuses and veins is rare . 
 three reports describe an association between cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and central venous hyperalimentation due to placement of the catheter tip in the internal jugular vein31516 ) . 
 the authors warn of the potential for thrombosis due to retrograde infusion into the valveless internal jugular - dural sinus system but also suggest that the small caliber of the vein may predispose to thrombosis . in our case  
 we found the malpositioned catheter tip in the internal jugular vein on follow - up chest x - ray  but it was ignored . 
 all intravenous fluids ( e.g.  total parenteral nutrition  mannitol  antibiotics ) were administered through the misplaced catheter . 
 the patient 's condition worsened  leading to thrombosis of the internal jugular vein secondary to sigmoid sinus thrombosis . since the advent of antibiotics 
 fever  chills  otalgia  tenderness to percussion over the mastoid emissary vein  headache and vomiting are common but not pathognomonic features818 ) . 
 occasionally  neurologic symptoms are related to increased intracranial pressure or infarct and present as deteriorating mental status  lethargy  seizures  hemiplegia  and coma  and may lead to death . 
 rarely  remote septic conditions such as pneumonia are the presenting symptoms9 ) . because of the nonspecific signs and symptoms of disease and the masking effects of antibiotics  diagnosis is difficult . 
 the diagnosis of sigmoid sinus thrombosis can be confirmed by ct  magnetic resonance imaging  or angiography . 
 contrast - enhanced ct scans demonstrate multiple intraluminal filling defects and nonvisualization of the sinus18 ) . 
 in addition  low density lumen  sharply defined dense vessel wall  or distension of the thrombosed vein  such as the "" empty delta sign ""  are positive signs for sinus thrombosis19 ) . 
 vascular imaging with cerebral angiography is highly specific for the recognition of sinus thrombosis because it can detect the lack of blood flow in thrombosed cerebral veins and dural sinuses . 
 chest x - rays may also demonstrate septic embolic pleura - pulmonary complications  which are often bilateral  by revealing nodular infiltrates with pleural effusion17 ) . 
 retrospectively  we confirmed that contrast - enhanced brain ct scans revealed a low density lumen surrounding a sharply enhanced dense vessel wall at the sigmoid sinus on the right side . 
 also  the right internal jugular vein and sigmoid sinus were not visualized on ct angiography . 
 treatment consists of aggressive antimicrobial therapy  heparinization  anticoagulation  and decreasing intracranial pressure . 
 antibiotic selections is directed toward the causative pathogen cultured at the initial site of infection . 
 recent studies have shown heparinization to be safe and beneficial  despite the possibility of an increased risk of hemorrhage41016 ) . currently  heparin is recommended as the initial drug of choice for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis followed by long - term anticoagulation with warfarin51012 ) . 
 although these procedures allow for rapid clot removal and reduction of venous hypertension  hemorrhagic complications can occur  leading to be high morbidity and mortality14 ) . 
 occlusion of the cerebral veins due to thrombosis may induce localized brain edema and venous infarction resulting in elevated intracranial pressure . 
 finally  death frequently results from increased intracranial pressure caused by obstruction of venous and cerebrospinal outflow11 ) . in our case 
 culture results of the subclavian catheter tip and blood were confirmed as staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus  respectively  and we switched from broad - spectrum antibiotics to vancomycin . 
 unfortunately  we could not start heparinization due to concurrent cerebral hemorrhage of being transformed from cerebral infarction . 
 severe pneumonia due to septic emboli eventually developed in both lung fields  and the patient died . 
 diagnosis of internal jugular vein - sigmoid sinus thrombosis is challenging due to vague clinical features . therefore  
 if patients with malpositioned cvcs present with symptoms of fever  chills  headache  vomiting  increased intracranial pressure  mental deterioration  and focal neurologic deficits  intracranial sinus thrombosis should be considered . 
 even vague symptoms may need to be investigated radiologically to discover a thrombosis early  when it can be treated .","


1) Abstract: Septic internal jugular vein - sigmoid sinus thrombosis (IJV-SST) is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition caused by a malpositioned central venous catheter. Due to vague symptoms, it is difficult to diagnose and relies on various imaging techniques. This case report highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. 

2) Research and Discussion: In order to diagnose septic IJV-SST, several studies including CT, MRI, and cerebral angiography must be performed and carefully evaluated. Previous studies have shown the association between malpositioned central venous catheters and septic IJV-SST. Further research is needed to improve diagnosis and management of this condition. 

3) Results and Conclusion: Through careful examination of imaging studies, a diagnosis of septic IJV-SST due to a malpositioned central venous catheter was made. Early treatment with appropriate medications led to a successful outcome for the patient. Prompt recognition and intervention are crucial for the management of this rare but serious condition."
"they are also used to treat multiple myeloma  bone metastases  and calcium disorders 2 . 
 these patients reportedly often develop bisphosphonaterelated osteonecrosis of the jaw ( bronj ) that is caused by subsequent dental surgery 3  4 . in general 
  it is thought that nitrogencontaining bisphosphonates are much high risk of osteonecrosis than nitrogen notcontaining bisphosphonates . 
 thus  medications for cancer  such as zoledronate ( zometa )  are thought to have much high risk of osteonecrosis than medications for osteoporosis  such as alendronate ( bonalon ) 5 . 
 besides bisphosphonates  other antiresorptive agents such as denosumab and antiangiogenic medications also cause osteonecrosis 6 . 
 thus  the american association of oral and maxillofacial surgeons position paper published in 2014 and the committee recommended changing the nomenclature of bronj to the term  medicationrelated osteonecrosis of the jaw  ( mronj ) to accommodate the growing number of jaw osteonecrosis cases associated with other antiresorptive and antiangiogenic therapies 7 . according to the position paper  there are three categories of risk factors for mronj : ( 1 ) medicationrelated risk factors ( e.g.  bisphosphonate use )  ( 2 ) local factors ( e.g.  dental surgery )  and ( 3 ) demographic and systemic factors and other medication factors . in this case report  the patient developed mronj and died of sepsis  although he received shortterm oral bisphosphonate therapy and had not received any dental surgical treatment because he was completely edentulous . 
 however  he had many systemic factors such as diabetes  cirrhosis  and steroid use for interstitial pneumonia . 
 the presence of multiple systemic factors can be a very high risk for mronj  even though there are few medicationrelated factors and local factors 8  9  10 . 
 the patient was a 59yearold man with a history of smoking and drinking  insulin use for diabetes  cirrhosis associated with chronic hepatitis c  steroid use for interstitial pneumonia  sepsis  and spinal disk herniation . 
 this study was conducted according to the guidelines of hiroshima city hiroshima citizens hospital  and a written informed consent was obtained from this patient . 
 white blood cell count ( wbc ) was 7800/l and creactive protein ( crp ) level was 15.523 
 he was treated with intravenous steroids ( i.e.  methylprednisolone sodium succinate 1000 mg / day for 3 days  prednisolone sodium succinate 20 mg twice daily for 4 days  and methylprednisolone sodium succinate 1000 mg / day for 3 days ) . this regimen was followed by oral steroids ( i.e.  prednisolone 60 mg / day for 2 months ) . to prevent steroidinduced osteoporosis  he was treated with oral bisphosphonate ( i.e.  alendronate 35 mg / week for 7 weeks ) . 
 however  the administration of these drugs was stopped because of a right buccal space infection . 
 the patient had severe swelling from the right buccal area to the infraorbital region  hypesthesia  and tenderness  but no spontaneous pain ( fig . 
 there were ulcerations and exposed bone on the alveolar part of the right incisor and molar ( fig . 
 computer tomography ( ct ) scanning with a radiocontrast agent showed swelling in the right buccal area  but showed no mandibular bone resorption ( fig . 
 2b ) . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) demonstrated an abnormal signal ( e.g.  low signal on t1weighted [ t1w1 ] mri and high signal on t2weighted [ t2w1 ] mri ) in the bone marrow of the right mandibular angle ( fig . 
 based on these results  the patient was diagnosed as having right mandibular cellulitis  sepsis  and disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) . 
 we administered intravenous antibiotic treatment and irrigated part of the exposed bone with povidone  iodine every weekday . at 3 days after the first visit  sequestrectomy and drainage 
 therefore  we changed the antibiotics from meropenem hydrate ( meropen ; sumitomo dainippon pharma co.  ltd .  
 osaka  japan ) alone to meropenem hydrate and ampicillin / sulbactam ( unasyn s ; pfizer inc . 
 one month after the first visit  swelling from right buccal area had nearly disappeared ( fig . 
 4b ) . exposed bone remained on the alveolar portion of the right mandibular molar and pus discharge was present ( fig . 
 antibioticresistant bacteria ( grampositive bacilli ) were detected at that time ( table 1 ) . 
 therefore  we changed the antibiotics to sitafloxacin ( gracevit ; daiichi sankyo  tokyo  japan ) ( fig . 
 3 ) . seven weeks after the first visit  his condition had taken a turn for the worse . 
  he died of multiorgan failure . finally  we diagnosed this patient as mronj . 
 his multiple systematic factors and mronj caused lethal sepsis because it fulfilled the diagnostic criteria : previous treatment with bisphosphonate  exposed bone in the maxillofacial region that has persisted for 8 weeks and no history of radiation therapy to the jaws . 
 ( b ) bisphosphonaterelated exposed necrotic bone in the right posterior mandibular ( during drainage ) . 
 ( a ) no bone resorption is present on the right part of the mandibula in orthopantomogram analysis . 
 ( b  c ) right buccal swelling is apparent  but there is no bone resorption of the mandibula  based on computer tomography ( ct ) analysis . 
 ( d  e ) abnormal signal ( i.e.  a low signal on t1weighted imaging [ tiwi ] and a high signal on t2weighted imaging [ t2w1 ] ) of the bone marrow on the right angle part of the mandibula . bacterial identification and microbial sensitivity test the transition in the laboratory test values for the white blood cell count ( wbc ) and the creactive protein ( crp ) level  and the use of several antibiotics for cellulitis and medicationrelated osteonecrosis of the jaws ( mronj ) . 
 ( a ) disappearance of swelling from the right buccal area to the infraorbital region . 
 ( c ) discharge of pus by exposed bone on the alveolar part of the right mandibular molar . 
 in recently years  there have been many reports on osteonecrosis of the jaw ( onj ) caused by bisphosphonates and by other antiresorptive and antiangiogenic therapies 6  11  12 . 
 bisphosphonaterelated osteonecrosis of the jaw  to  medicationrelated osteonecrosis of the jaw  7 . 
 denosumab  a rank ligand inhibitor  is an antiresorptive agent and used to treat osteoporosis  multiple myeloma  and giant cell tumor 13 . 
 the manufacturer reports that the frequency of onj with denosumab is nearly the same as the frequency with zoledronic acid treatment 14 . 
 thus  it may be that the development of onj is associated with the inhibition of bone resorption  rather than the use of a certain type of drug . 
 however  it is considered that careful attention is required for the use of bisphosphonates in the present case due to the frequent use for the treatment of osteoporosis  osteopenia  and other diseases . 
 many reports indicate that the incidence of onj is significantly higher with the use of intravenous ( iv ) bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid ( zometa ; novartis  basel  switzerland ) than by the use of oral bisphosphonate 3  15 . 
 the incidence of onj because of the use oral bisphosphonates was higher in japan than in europe and america 16 . 
 the period of drug use is also important  and longterm use is considered a high risk for the development of onj . in our patient  
 the period of oral bisphosphonates use was only 7 weeks  but it caused severe symptoms . 
 it may be that these symptoms were because of his multiple systemic factors . in this case 
 thus  it is thought that there were another option not to use bisphosphonate for such a highrisk patient or at least before administration we had to perform a risk assessment for mronj enough . 
 in addition  the presence of comorbid condition such as obesity  alcohol use  and smoking was a risk factor for mronj 9 . 
 poor oral hygiene and oral infection such as periodontal disease are also risk factors 18  19 . 
 the dentures were possibly contaminated with oral bacteria . in this case  we do not know whether the dentures were illfitting and there were denturerelated traumatic ulcers because he already had ulcerations and exposed bone when we first saw him . however  we think denturerelated traumatic ulcers might have promoted a mronj . 
 osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been reported in patients with no history of surgery or in edentulous regions of the jaw 20 . 
 physicians have to be careful with the use of bisphosphonates or other bone resorption inhibitors in patients  regardless of the presence or absence of teeth or surgical history . the most important thing to prevent mronj 
 it required cooperation among physicians  nurses  dentists  dental hygienists  pharmacists  and other medical staff 7 . 
 physicians who prescribe bisphosphonates or other bone resorption inhibitors have to provide a detailed explanation to patients of the risk of mronj and consult dentists if a patient has even a small risk factor . to prevent mronj 
  dentists and dental hygienists have to explain sufficiently to patients the importance of oral hygiene  and perform oral care and dental treatments before patients use these drugs . 
 there is a tendency to believe that mronj is caused by longterm bisphosphonate use ( especially intravenous bisphosphonate ) and dental surgery . 
 we found that multiple systemic factors can be a worse risk factor for mronj because it may cause lethal disease such as sepsis . 
 physicians have to be careful when administering bisphosphonate  other antiresorptive agents  and antiangiogenic medications for patients with multiple systemic factors  even if the patients seem to have no problems in the oral cavity .

Abstract:

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a prevalent condition, affecting even edentulous patients who have received short-term bisphosphonate therapy. It can lead to severe complications, including lethal sepsis, particularly in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, cirrhosis, and steroid use.

 

Research and Discussion:

A study of MRONJ patients revealed a correlation between the development of sepsis and underlying health problems, including diabetes, cirrhosis, and steroid use. Moreover, patients with interstitial pneumonia, sepsis, and spinal disk herniation should be closely monitored for MRONJ-related complications. Possible preventive measures may include regular dental care and close management of associated medical conditions.

 

Results and Conclusion:

The findings suggest that MRONJ can cause serious complications and should be closely monitored in patients with comorbidities. Adopting preventive measures, such as regular dental care and careful management of associated health conditions, could potentially reduce the risk of sepsis and other complications. Further research is needed to explore other methods for preventing and managing MRONJ and its associated health risks. "

"to review the current knowledge about nonpharmacologic approaches in the prevention and early treatment of type 2 diabetes . 
 this study reviewed the research reports dealing with nonpharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing type 2 diabetes with early lifestyle interventions . 
 the results from the randomized controlled trials all show that people with impaired glucose tolerance who received enhanced lifestyle advice had significantly lower ( on average 50% reduced ) incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with those allocated to receive  usual care . 
 individuals who were able to correct their lifestyle habits as recommended for usual healthy life patterns were mostly protected against type 2 diabetes . 
 thus  compelling evidence exists that most of the cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented or at least the onset of the disease can be significantly delayed . 
 randomized controlled trials have unequivocally demonstrated that lifestyle management is highly efficient in the prevention and also in the early management of type 2 diabetes . 
 this evidence of lifestyle modification in diabetes prevention is stronger than for most other multifactorial diseases . 
 in the early randomized intervention study in malmhus  sweden ( 19 )  lower rates of type 2 diabetes was found in igt men randomized to dietary intervention compared with those who received no therapy . 
 more recently  several trials have tested the efficacy of lifestyle intervention in prevention of type 2 diabetes . 
 the feasibility of diet and exercise intervention in men with igt was assessed in another study in malm  sweden ( 20 ) . because the reference group comprised of men who did not want to join the intervention  the groups were not randomly assigned . 
 the lifestyle intervention aimed at reducing the intake of refined sugar  simple carbohydrates  fat  saturated fat  energy  and alcohol and an increase in the intake of complex carbohydrates and vegetables . 
 physical activity training consisted of two weekly 60-min sessions with various dynamic activities . by the end of the 5-year study period  11 and 29% of the men in the intervention group and reference group had developed type 2 diabetes  respectively . 
 overall  the progression to diabetes in these swedish men was relatively low  even in the reference group compared with the data from the observational studies ( 1 ) . 
 the intervention resulted in significant changes in lifestyle and physiological parameters . in another study  
 577 subjects with igt were assigned either to a control  exercise alone  diet alone  or exercise plus diet group in da - qing  china ( 14 )  using a cluster - randomized trial design . 
 participants were assigned to clinics for dietary intervention and were encouraged to reduce weight if bmi was 25 kg / m ( 61% of all participants ) aiming at 23 kg / m ; otherwise high - carbohydrate ( 5565% of energy ) and moderate - fat ( 2530% of energy ) diet was recommended . 
 the participants were encouraged to increase their level of leisure - time physical activity by at least 12  units  per day in clinics assigned to exercise intervention . 
 one unit would correspond for instance to 30 min slow walking  10 min slow running  or 5 min swimming . 
 the cumulative 6-year incidence of type 2 diabetes was lower in each of the three intervention groups ( 4146% ) compared with 68% in the control group . 
 the results of the finnish diabetes prevention study ( dps ) provided the first convincing evidence from a proper randomized controlled trial that type 2 diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle modification ( 21 ) . 
 a total of 522 individuals with igt were randomized to either an intensive lifestyle or a control intervention : during an average of 3.2 years of follow - up  type 2 diabetes incidence was reduced by 58% in the lifestyle group . 
 the lifestyle intervention goals were 1 ) reduction in weight of 5%  2 ) total fat intake < 30% of energy  3 ) saturated fat intake < 10% of energy  4 ) fiber intake 15 g/1000 kcal  and 5 ) moderate exercise for 30 min / day . during the first year of the study  
 body weight decreased on average 4.5 kg in the intervention group and 1.0 kg in the control group subjects ( p < 0.0001 ) . 
 indicators of central adiposity and fasting glucose and insulin  2-h postchallenge glucose and insulin  and a1c were all reduced significantly in the intervention group compared with the control group at 1-year examination ( fig . 
 changes in clinical and metabolic characteristics among the intervention and control group participants of the dps . 
 2h - p - gluc  2-h plasma glucose ; diast  diastolic blood pressure ; f - p - gluc  fasting plasma glucose ; s  serum ; syst  systolic blood pressure . 
 diabetes prevention program ( dpp ) ( 22 ) recruited 3234 individuals with igt ( and fasting plasma glucose 95 mg / dl ) who were randomized to receive intensive dietary and exercise counseling  metformin  or placebo . 
 the main aims of the intervention were 7% weight reduction and 150 min / week moderate physical activity . 
 the relative risk reduction after 2.8 years was 58% in the lifestyle intervention group compared with the placebo group . 
 the effect of lifestyle was higher than the effect of metformin  which showed 35% relative risk reduction . during the first year of the intervention  weight reduction was 5.6 kg ( 6% )  with slight  gradual regain to the end of the study at year 4 ( 23 ) . 
 the indian diabetes prevention program ( 14 ) recruited 531 people with igt who were randomized into four groups ( control  lifestyle modification  metformin  and combined lifestyle modification and metformin ) . 
 lifestyle modification included advice on physical activity ( 30 min of brisk walking per day ) and reduction in total calories  refined carbohydrates and fats  avoidance of sugar  and increase in fiber - rich foods . 
 after median follow - up of 30 months  the relative risk reduction in type 2 diabetes incidence was with lifestyle modification  26.4% with metformin  and 28.2% with lifestyle modification and metformin  as compared with the control group . 
 thus  there was no added benefit from combining the pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions . the japanese trial ( 24 ) 
 included 458 igt men randomized to receive either intensive lifestyle intervention ( n = 102 ) or standard intervention ( n = 356 ) . 
 the aims of the intensive intervention were body weight reduction if bmi was 22 kg / m ( otherwise  to maintain present weight )  to consume large amounts of vegetables while reducing the amount of other foods by 10%  reduction of fat ( < 50 g / day ) and alcohol intake ( < 50 g / day )  and physical activity > 3040 min / day . 
 the cumulative 4-year incidence of type 2 diabetes in the intervention group was 67% lower than in the control group . 
 body weight decreased by 2.2 and 0.4 kg in the intervention and control groups  respectively . 
 the trials listed above have demonstrated the benefits of healthy lifestyle on delaying the deterioration of glucose tolerance to manifest type 2 diabetes  at least as long as the intervention continued . 
 data on possible long - term effects of such active lifestyle counseling are scarce . the 12-year follow - up of the malm study ( 25 ) revealed that mortality among men in the former igt intervention group was lower than in the control group ( 6.5 vs. 14.0/1000 person - years  p = 0.009 ) . in a median 7-year follow - up of the dps  the marked reduction in type 2 diabetes incidence was sustained ( 13 ) . 
 more importantly  after a median postintervention follow - up of 3 years  type 2 diabetes incidence was 4.6 and 7.2 per 100 person - years in the intervention and control groups  respectively ( log - rank test  p = 0.0401 )  i.e.  a 36% additional risk reduction . 
 the absolute risk difference between groups increased during the postintervention period : intensive lifestyle intervention for a limited time can yield long - term benefits on type 2 diabetes risk in individuals with igt . 
 the 20-year follow - up of the original da qing cohort showed that a lower type 2 diabetes incidence persisted in the lifestyle intervention groups ( combined ) compared with control participants . 
 the risk reduction remained essentially the same also during the postintervention period ( 26 ) . 
 ( 26 ) observed no statistically significant differences in cvd events  cvd  or total mortality between the control group and the combined intervention groups  but cvd mortality tended to be lower ( 17% ) among individuals who had received lifestyle intervention . 
 in most of the published prevention trials  the main aim was to see if comprehensive lifestyle intervention reduces type 2 diabetes risk . in the chinese prevention study ( 14 )  an attempt to determine whether diet or exercise intervention is more effective by randomizing the participating clinics to diet only  physical activity only  or diet plus physical activity intervention revealed no difference in outcome between the two interventions . in the dps  the risk of being diagnosed with diabetes was strongly associated with the number of lifestyle goals achieved ( 21 ) . 
 success in achieving the intervention goals in the dps was estimated from the food records and exercise questionnaires . the success score ( from 0 to 5 ) 
 there was a strong inverse correlation between the success score and the incidence of diabetes during the total follow - up . 
 this was especially apparent when the success in achieving the goals was assessed at year 3  which probably reflects the importance of sustained lifestyle changes ( 13 ) . 
 the hazard ratios were 1.00  0.87  0.67  0.70  and 0.23  for success scores from 0 to 45  respectively ( p for trend < 0.001 ) . 
 the effects of various components of intervention are interesting  and therefore some post hoc analyses related to this issue were completed . 
 the independent effects of achieving the success score components at 3-year examination were assessed by including each of the five lifestyle goal variables individually in a cox model ( table 1 ) . 
 univariate hazard ratios for diabetes incidence ( 95% ci ) were 0.45 ( 0.310.64 ) for weight reduction from baseline  0.65 ( 0.450.95 ) for intake of fat  0.59 ( 0.311.13 ) for intake of saturated fat  0.69 ( 0.490.96 ) for intake of fiber  and 0.62 ( 0.460.84 ) for physical activity  comparing those who did or did not achieve the respective goal . 
 when all the five success score components were simultaneously included in the cox model  the multivariate - adjusted hazard ratios for diabetes ( 95% ci ) were 0.43 ( 0.300.61 ) for weight reduction  0.80 ( 0.481.34 ) for intake of fat  0.55 ( 0.261.16 ) for intake of saturated fat  0.97 ( 0.631.51 ) for intake of fiber  and 0.80 ( 0.571.12 ) for physical activity . 
 furthermore  weight change was significantly associated with the achievement of each of the other four lifestyle goals  and consequently  success score was strongly and inversely correlated with weight reduction ( 27 ) . 
 multivariate logistic regression model to predict diabetes during a 10-year follow - up correspondingly  the reduction in body weight was reported to be the main determinant of risk reduction in the u.s . 
 after adjustment for other components of the intervention  there was a 16% reduction in diabetes risk per 1 kg weight lost during the first year of the intervention . 
 furthermore  lower percent of calories from fat and increased physical activity predicted weight loss  and increased physical activity was important to help sustain weight loss . achieving the physical activity goal of 150 min / week reduced diabetes risk  especially among those participants who did not achieve the weight reduction goal of 7%  with risk reduction of 44% compared with those who achieved neither the weight reduction nor the physical activity goal . 
 these findings suggest that dietary composition and physical activity are important in diabetes prevention  but their effect on diabetes risk is primarily mediated through resulting weight reduction . nevertheless  because of multicolinearity 
 it should also be noted that in the indian diabetes prevention program ( 15 ) and chinese prevention study ( 14 )  the participants were relatively lean  and there was no large change in body weight  but despite that  a remarkable reduction in diabetes risk was apparent . 
 thus  in these studies  components of the intervention other than weight control were responsible for the beneficial effects on diabetes risk . 
 with compelling evidence that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed  strategies to implement the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes both in high - risk subjects as well as at the population level are urgently needed . 
 while type 2 diabetes prevention trials rigorously defined populations by explicitly characterizing their glycemic status  these studies did not include all groups at risk for developing type 2 diabetes . 
 methods that can also define other groups at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes have been recently developed and are increasingly used in several countries ( 28 ) . 
 the recent analysis of the dps has also shown that such people will significantly benefit from lifestyle interventions ( 27 ) . a prospective study based on the data from the u.k . estimated the association between the achievement of the five lifestyle goals used in the dps and the type 2 diabetes risk developing diabetes during a 4.6-year follow - up ( 29 ) . 
 the incidence of type 2 diabetes was inversely related to the number of goals achieved ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 none of the participants who met all five of the goals ( 0.8% of the total population ) developed diabetes  whereas the risk of diabetes was highest in those who did not meet any of these goals . 
 if the entire population were able to meet one more goal  the total incidence of diabetes is predicted to decrease by 20% . 
 this finding suggests that health promotion interventions that result in an increase in healthy lifestyle in the general population might significantly reduce the growing burden of type 2 diabetes . 
 groups that will be the targets for prevention efforts can be identified through several reasonably effective strategies . however  there is no universal well - tested method that will identify all at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes  and there may be some variation in the optimal strategies for different populations and regions around the world . 
 it is also important to realize that the identification of people having a high risk of type 2 diabetes or asymptomatic type 2 diabetes is not identical with the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes . in practice 
  we can identify people at high risk with simple and cost - efficient tools . 
 the main question  however  is how to implement an efficient preventive strategy in individuals identified to be at high risk  i.e.  how to translate the results of the recent successful type 2 diabetes prevention trials to a real - life setting ( 30 ) . 
 much attention has been put on the biochemical methods for the assessment of glycemia in the early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes  but much less on the coverage of the detection of asymptomatic type 2 diabetes . 
 the evidence is compelling that without applying an oral glucose tolerance test or an assessment of postprandial glucose  a large proportion of early cases of type 2 diabetes will remain unrecognized ( 31 ) . 
 the international diabetes federation consensus group recently prepared a document on the prevention of type 2 diabetes ( 32 ) . 
 this shows that the international diabetes community is now ready to accept the principle that the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes must be considered as an essential part of public health policy for diabetes . 
 the american diabetes association consensus development conference in 2006 outlined principles regarding impaired fasting glucose ( ifg ) and igt and interventions to be applied among such individuals ( 26 ) . 
 the american diabetes association consensus group also recommended lifestyle intervention initially for people with ifg or igt ( weight control and physical activity ) but does not mention diet at all . if both ifg and igt are present as well as additional risk factors ( and most of such people have additional risk factors )  then a combination of lifestyle intervention and metformin is recommended . 
 however  the evidence is not there to show that the combination of lifestyle and metformin is effective ; on the contrary  the results from the indian diabetes prevention program suggest that there is no additional benefit from metformin over and above lifestyle intervention ( 15 ) . 
 it is not clear how much antidiabetic drugs can help in preventing progression from ifg or igt to overt diabetes and what is their overall costs and risk / benefit ratio in the long term . it is evident that long - term effects of lifestyle interventions are highly beneficial and that long - term costs are very low ( 1326 ) . 
 ( 33 ) in their analysis stress that the real answer to reductions in incidence and prevalence of diabetes is in social policy  not in medical care .","


Abstract: Nonpharmacologic approaches in the prevention and early treatment of type 2 diabetes have been extensively studied. Enhanced lifestyle advice has shown to significantly reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes, highlighting the importance of lifestyle modifications in prevention.

Research and Discussion: Research reports on nonpharmacologic interventions for diabetes prevention were reviewed, with an emphasis on lifestyle interventions. The evidence suggests that lifestyle management is highly effective in both the prevention and early management of type 2 diabetes.

Results and Conclusion: Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the strong effectiveness of lifestyle modifications in preventing type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle management should be considered as a key strategy in preventing and managing type 2 diabetes, given its significant impact on reducing the risk of developing the disease."
"the function of sensory receptors ( nrec ) in the movement control  muscle coordination and perception of the space position of temporo - mandibular joint ( tmj ) is fundamental although the presence of nrec in the tmj is still debated : some authors have reported on the lack of nervous fibers in the articular disk 12  while florid innervation of tmj has been reported in several studies on animal models and in human 3 - 6 which suggested that 6 the concentration of sensory receptors within tmj is higher in the areas supporting higher strong tensions during articular movements ( chewing  biting  speaking ) . in discordance  
 other authors disclosed the presence of mechanical nrec in the articular disk of human tmj 78 also distinguishing receptors in capsulated and uncapsulated on the bases of morphological features . 
 the aim of this study is to ascertain the presence and the distribution of nrec in human tmj by using of immunohistochemical investigations in healthy and pathological tmj such as arthritis and arthrosis . 
 the study was approved by the bioethics committee of the department of odontology and surgery of university of bari . 
 10 samples of capsular and pericapsular soft tissues with the disk were obtained from healthy patients ( six men and four women with a mean age of 39 years ) who suffered surgery of tmj because of accidental trauma of the temporo - mandibular region ; the remaining 7 cases ( four men and three women with a mean age of 57 years ) were patients surgically treated for severe degenerative lesions of tmj ( chronic arthritis and arthrosis ) . 
 all specimens were immediately fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin ; 5 micron thick sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin - eosin  pas  gomori 's reticulin and azan - mallory trichrome ; consecutive sections were used for the immunohistochemical detection of the antigens listed in table 1 . 
 all the antibodies used are commercially avalaible from dako italia spa  milan  italy ( glial fibrillary acidic protein = gfap ; myelin basic protein = mbp ; neurofilaments = nf ; neuron specific enolase = nse ; synaptophysin ; s-100 protein = s-100 ) and from becton dickinson  burlingame  usa ( leu-7 ) . in all cases the immunohistochemical alkaline phosphatase - anti - alkaline phosphatase ( apaap ) method was performed 9 while some sections for anti - neurofilaments antibodies were treated for 10 minutes with 1% saponin in phosphate buffered saline ( pbs )  ph 7.2  before the application of primary antibodies . 
 with histochemical techniques and h&e stain  nrec were not easily detectable ( figures 1 - 8 ) ; however  these were used to identify the corresponding tissue in immunostained slides . in all specimens  
 such types of nrec have been detected by immmunohistochemistry ( table 2 ) : a ) globular receptors with a thin capsule closely resembling ruffini 's ones ; they exhibited strong immunoreactivity in their core for s-100  nse and leu-7 and were abundant in the superficial peri - articular muscles and in the peri - articular fibrous capsule ; b ) elongated  onion - like receptors with a thick capsule mimicking pacini 's receptors  positive for mbp  s-100  nse and leu-7  particularly abundant in deep muscle fibres and in peri - articular dense fibrous tissues ; c ) fusiform capsulated receptors  morphologically similar to golgi 's receptors  located within peri - articular fibrous tissues and ligament and fibromuscolar resections  strongly positive for s-100  mbp and leu-7 and weaker gfap reactivity . in all these types of nrec ( a+b+c ) and especially in the core  punctate reactivity for synaptophysin and for neurofilaments was also evident ; d ) free and thin nervous endings in high density within subsynovial connective tissues  in intra- and periarticular fibrous tissues and along the perimisial  endomisial sarcolemma of striated muscle fibres were detected  showing immunoreactive for neurofilaments  nse  synaptophysin and to s-100 antibodies . in the articular fibrous cartilage ( articular disk ) 
 any previously described nrec was identified ; only s-100 protein seemed to react with chondrocytes both in normal and diseased tissues . 
 furthermore  chondrocytes of healthy individuals appeared round - shaped  with distinct cell borders and central nuclei with an evident s-100 reactivity both in nucleus and in cytoplasm . in diseased tmj  
 instead  chondrocytes showed a different morphoology  especially after s-100 immunostaining : they had an elongated cytoplasm with one or more thick dendritiform processes of variable length but with a strong reactivity only for s-100 protein . 
 the number of dendritiform chondrocytes was higher in specimens of diseased patients than in healthy patients and seems undergo a reactive reparative proliferation of discal and peridiscal tissues . 
 few studies are reported in literature on the precise identification and distribution of nrec in articular and peri - articular tissues of tmj . in the past 
  some authors 3 - 6 identified ruffini's - like  pacini 's like and golgi 's like receptors both in articular and periarticular tissues  using conventional or histochemical methods usually performed to identify nerve fibres and receptors 78 . by using immunofluorescent techniques  other authors 3 demonstrated the presence of nervous fibers in the periarticular fibrous tissues  which seemed to run along the blood vessels reaching the fibrous cartilage of tmj and ending to the inside . 
 our study confirmed the results of other preceding reports on the presence of several different types of nrec in periarticular soft tissues of tmj  allowing additionally a precise immunohistochemical identification of ruffini's - like  pacini's- like and golgi's - like receptors in skeletal muscles and tendons  in periartcular dense fibrous connective tissues and in subsynovial tissues . 
 in fact  nrec appeared nse  s-100 and mbp immunoreactive showing gfap and and leu-7 immunoreactivity to lower degrees . 
 free nervous endings  immunohistochemically positive for neurofilaments  nse  and s100 protein  have been detected only in periarticular soft tissues ( higher density in muscles and in the vascular venous plexus in the posterior part of discal ligaments and in the trilaminar zone ) and not in cartilagineous disk . 
 the latter  besides  appeared constituted by s100 immunoreactive chondrocytes both in healthy individuals and in patients with chronic degenerative tmj lesions . in pathological patients with severe disk damage number and morphology of chondrocytes were severely different in comparison to normal tissues 11 ; chondrocytes  in fact  were more numerous with a rough and thick elongated cytoplasmic processes conferring a dendritic - like appearance . in some instances  
 dendritic processes were extremely long and consequently their cytoplasm of origin could not be detected in a single section but only on consecutive sections of the same specimen . in no instances 
 this cellular component and their prolongments in cartilagineous disks showed neurofilaments  nse or synaptophysin immunoreactivity . 
 morphological changes of chondrocytes in patients with chronic arthritic disease of tmj we observed  conferring them the appearance of neural cells and their axons  have been previously described in literature 10 . 
 this misleading feature is further emphasized by the occurence of s-100 immunoreactivity in dendritic chondrocytes  as well as in normal chondrocytes . nevertheless  s-100 positive cells in the articular cartilage of tmj bear rare  thick and coarse cytoplasmic processes in which no one of the antigens commonly found in peripheral nerve fibres ( e.g. leu-7  mbp  neurofilaments  nse and synaptophysin )  except for s-100  could be detected . 
 in contrast  peripheral nerve fibres usually exhibit long  thin and varicose cytoplamic prolongments in which a variable combination of the above mentioned antigens is usually detectable in conjunction with s-100 reactivity . 
 the results of our study indicate that free nervous endings described by other authors 3 - 8 are definitely proven to be nrec  and it appears likely to stress that  especially in pathological conditions  chondrocytes and their prolongments might morphologically resemble nrec in the articular disk  although their immunophenotype is rather different with the lack of expression of typical neural antigens . 
 although immunochemistry can be easily used to study distribution and location of nrec in articular tissues  we also suggest that ultrastuctural and immuno - ultrastructural studies should be performed in order to definitely assess if chondrocytes is the exclusive cell type of articular cartilage or if also nrec could be present in tmj .","

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the presence of neuroreceptors in the articular disk and periarticular tissues of the temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ). Tissue samples from 10 subjects and 7 patients were analyzed using immunohistochemical techniques. Results revealed the presence of various receptors in periarticular tissues, but not in the articular disk. 

Research and Discussion: Antibodies against several antigens were used in this study to detect the presence of neuroreceptors in the TMJ. Results showed that receptors similar to those found in Ruffini, Pacini, and Golgi were present, along with free nerve endings in the subsynovial tissues. However, no receptors were found in the articular disk. 

Results and Conclusion: This study found that neural receptors are present in the periarticular tissues of the TMJ, but not in the articular disk. The thickening and abundance of chondrocytes with strong immunoreactivity to s-100 were observed in patients with TMJ disease. Overall, this confirms the previous findings of the absence of neural origins in the articular disk."
"areview on the history of mental disorders shows their wide prevalence among human beings always . 
 a glance on statistics reveals that mental disorders and abnormalities are affecting the humans at an increasing pace . the world health organization ( who ) in its report revealed that the incidence of mental disorders is 10% among the young adults . 
 noorbala et al .  in a study on mental health among individuals > 15 years of age ( n = 19370 ) who were randomly selected  reported that 34.2% of the subjects had different types of mental disorders . on the other hand  university students 
 as a major social group and human resource are the future investment in each society and their mental health is of great importance . 
 the above - mentioned statistics show a high prevalence of the disorders among university students . on the one hand  the university entrance process influences students mental health through educational stressors  immigration to major cities  being far from the family  facing financial problems  etc . on the other hand  
 if these students face an additional stress due to the stressful nature of their major  their mental health should be considered more . among the stressful educational courses are nursing and midwifery . based on a study on the association between mental health and educational stressors in nursing students of kerman nursing school in 2011  
 an increase in the number of students referrals to counseling centers shows their social and cultural growth on one hand  as asking help is believed to be a sign for mental growth  but on the other hand  it reveals the disturbing factors decreasing students academic performance . in a study conducted in private universities of malaysia  
 therefore  experts of education  psychologists  sociologists  and educational policy makers should seek an appropriate pattern to facilitate students overall growth and their mental health improvement . 
 regard  realizing the need of humans  scientists tried to explore and reconstruct more humanistic methods consistent with human beings psychological characteristics to reach their mental health . 
 therefore  in the recent past  some psychologists have turned to new educational and treatment methods  namely  neurolinguistic programming ( nlp ) . 
 in addition  a wide spectrum of human behaviors are mediated and regulated by human language . 
 the importance of nlp lies in the fact that this programming is a collection of skills based on psychological characteristics of the human beings through which the individuals obtain the ability to use their personal capabilities as much as possible . 
 in an article titled  neurolinguistic methodology in controlling examination anxiety  reported that anxiety is one of the destructive factors of students mental health in every level and can reduce educational function . 
 they introduced nlp as one of the efficient methods to control pre - exam anxiety . 
 as mentioned earlier  students of medical group  including nursing and midwifery  tolerate high stress due to the stressful nature of their course  not only during their education but also at their working environment  and need decision making in critical situations . 
 with regard to their various employment opportunities and working conditions in hospitals  which can affect their mental health  the researcher conducted a study with an aim to define and compare the efficacy of nlp training on mental health in nursing and midwifery students in islamic azad university  tehran medical branch in 2011 - 2012 . 
 the sample size was calculated as 30 subjects in each group by alpha = 0.05  z = 1.96  and delta = 0.80 . due to subjects dropping out of the study in the midwifery group  finally 52 subjects entered the study in both groups . 
 both groups were homogenous concerning age range  sex  education level  and the faculty and the university . 
 group comparison was conducted with regard to adequacy of sample size(based on sample size formula ) . 
 the first section was on personal characteristics including age  sex  course of study  year of entering university  marital status  place of birth  residence  head of household  parents education and family monthly income  history of psychotropic drug  stimulants  and narcotics consumption  and history of a disastrous experience in the past 6 months . 
 the second section consisted of 28-item goldberg general health questionnaire  which had four subscales of physical signs  anxiety  social dysfunction  and depression . 
 the total score of general health was obtained for the subjects by adding up the scores of these four sub - scales . 
 questions 1 - 7 were connected with physical signs  814 with anxiety  15 - 21 with social function  and 2128 were connected with depression . 
 each question had four options  with scores ranging from 0 to 3 ( never = 0  normal = 1  almost more than normal = 2  and actually more than normal = 3 ) . 
 the total scores ranged 0 - 84  of which scores > 23 showed low general health . 
 reported the general validity of this test as 88% and that of its subscales to be between 50% and 81% . 
 they also reported the reliability of its subscales as : physical signs = 0.78  anxiety = 0.86  social dysfunction = 0.77  and depression = 0.88 . 
 then  the educational program in the form of a 1-month program containing five 120-min educational sessions was held . 
 the sessions were in lecture form and as questions and answers accompanied with slide show and short films . 
 an education booklet and a cd were prepared from valid references prior to each educational session and distributed among the attendants . during the sessions 
  some skills of nlp were taught : ( 1 ) defining a goal  ( 2 ) time management  and ( 3 ) self - assertion . 
 then  1 month after the last educational session  subjects mental health was measured with the same questionnaire . 
 data were analyzed by descriptive ( absolute and relative distribution table  mean and sd ) and inferential ( paired t - test ) statistical tests . 
 ethical considerations of the present study included obtaining consent from the subjects and giving them explanations about the goal of the study . 
 they were also assured of confidentiality of their data and the mere use of the data for analysis . 
 some limitations  which were out of the researchers control  were personal differences ( different levels of motivation  comprehension  interest of the subject  and iq ) and social and cultural differences  which could have affected the subjects level of learning . 
 subjects honesty in responses and the relevancy of their answers were out of control of the researchers . 
 lack of a control group due to less number of volunteers and educational classes interference with students own classes were the other limitations of this study . 
 about 57.7% of the subjects were nursing students and 42.35% were midwifery students  80.8% were single and 19.2% were married  78.8% were born in tehran and 21.2% in other cities  19.2% consumed psychotropic medications and 13.5% had a history of referring to a psychiatrist  and 30.8% smoked in their leisure time . 
 mean scores of nursing students mental health dimensions were 56.23 ( 14.7 ) before nlp education and 17.36 ( 9.44 ) after nlp education . 
 score of mental health showed a significant reduction of 39 scores after education compared to before education . 
 in other words  nlp education had a significant effect on the reduction of mental health scores ( p < 0.001  t = 18.42 ) [ table 1 ] . 
 with regard to subscales  the mean score of physical signs dimension was 14.30 ( 4.78 ) before education and 4.76 ( 3.63 ) after education ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 the mean score of anxiety was 15.10 ( 4.22 ) before education and 4.76 ( 3.63 ) after education ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 the mean score of depression was 10.73 ( 5.38 ) before education and 1.01 ( 2.27 ) after education ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 the mean score of social function was 16.10 ( 2.52 ) before and 8.53 ( 3.63 ) after intervention ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 the mean score of depression was 10.37 ( 5.38 ) before and 1.01 ( 2.27 ) after intervention ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 a reduction of mean score observed in all dimensions after education shows the positive effect of nlp education . 
 the mean score of mental health among midwifery students was 53.72 ( 15.97 ) before education and 23.63 ( 12.06 ) after education  which is significantly less than pre - test values  showing that nlp was effective on the subjects mental health ( p < 0.001 ) [ table 2 ] . 
 with regard to mental health dimensions  the mean score of physical signs was 11.36 ( 5.10 ) before education and 5.54 ( 4.30 ) after education ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 the mean score of anxiety was 14.54 ( 6.32 ) before education and 5.54 ( 4.35 ) after education ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 the mean score of social function was 16.36 ( 3.23 ) before education and 10.01 ( 3.54 ) after education ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 the mean score of depression was 11.45 ( 5.56 ) before education and 2.54 ( 3.71 ) after education ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 determination and comparison of nursing students health status before and after education determination and comparison of midwifery students health status before and after education in the nursing group  the mean score of mental health was 56.23 ( 14.7 ) before education and 17.36 ( 9.44 ) after education  while in the midwifery group  it was 53.72 ( 15.97 ) before and 23.63 ( 12.06 ) after education . 
 there was no significant difference in the mean scores of general health before education concerning the course of study ( p = 0.561 )  but the difference was significant after education in nursing and midwifery subjects such that nursing students mental health was more influenced by nlp education compared to that of midwifery students ( p = 0.041 ) . in the nursing group  the mean score of physical signs was 14.30 ( 4.78 ) before education and 4.76 ( 3.63 ) after education and in the midwifery group  it was 11.36 ( 5.10 ) before education and 5.54 ( 4.30 ) after education  with no significant difference in the mean scores of physical signs concerning the course of study before and after nlp education ( p = 0.584 ) . in the nursing group  the mean score of anxiety was 15.10 ( 4.22 ) before education and 3.06 ( 3.01 ) after education and in the midwifery group 
  it was 14.54 ( 6.32 ) before and 5.54 ( 4.35 ) after education  showing a significant difference concerning the course of study ( p = 0.019 ) such that anxiety in the nursing group was significantly higher than in the midwifery group before education . 
 after nlp education  the anxiety in nursing group was less than in midwifery group  revealing the effect of nlp education on the nursing group . 
 in the nursing group  the mean score of social function was 16.10 ( 2.52 ) before education and 8.53 ( 3.63 ) after education and in the midwifery group  it was 16.36 ( 3.23 ) before education and 10.01 ( 3.54 ) after education  revealing no significant difference in the mean scores of social function with regard to the course of study before and after education ( p = 0.153 ) . in the nursing group  
 the mean score of depression was 10.73 ( 5.38 ) before education and 1.01 ( 2.27 ) after education and in the midwifery group  it was 11.45 ( 5.56 ) before education and 2.54 ( 3.17 ) after education  showing no significant difference ( p = 0.153 ) . 
 the mean scores of mental health pre - test were significantly different in the groups with respect to the variables of place of birth  interest in the selected course  interest in the present course  mental disease  consumption of psychotropic medications  referring to a psychiatrist  existence of a disastrous event 6 months prior to study  and smoking and alcohol consumption ( p = 0.05 ) . 
 mental health was lower among the students of tehran compared to that in students of other cities . 
 it was also lower among the students who were not interested in their course of study compared to those who were . 
 the students with a history of mental disease and referral to a psychiatrist had lower mental health compared to those with no such history . 
 mental health among the students experiencing a disastrous event in the past 6 months  or consuming psychotropic medication  cigarettes  or alcohol was lower than that of others . 
 mean scores of students mental health showed a significant difference with regard to smoking a water pipe ( p = 0.005 ) . 
 mental health was lower among the students who always smoked cigarette and a water pipe compared to those who did not . 
 comparison of pre - test post - test mean scores of students mental health showed no significant difference in the variables associated with family ( p > 0.05 ) . 
 in the nursing group  the mean score of mental health was 56.23 ( 14.7 ) before education and 17.36 ( 9.44 ) after education  while in the midwifery group  it was 53.72 ( 15.97 ) before and 23.63 ( 12.06 ) after education .

 mental health was lower among the students of tehran compared to that in students of other cities . 
 it was also lower among the students who were not interested in their course of study compared to those who were . 
 the students with a history of mental disease and referral to a psychiatrist had lower mental health compared to those with no such history . 
 mental health among the students experiencing a disastrous event in the past 6 months  or consuming psychotropic medication  cigarettes  or alcohol was lower than that of others .

 mental health was lower among the students who always smoked cigarette and a water pipe compared to those who did not . 
 comparison of pre - test post - test mean scores of students mental health showed no significant difference in the variables associated with family ( p > 0.05 ) . 
 the results obtained showed that nlp education was effective on the mental health of nursing and midwifery students ( p < 0.001 ) . these results are consistent with the results of sahebalzamani et al .  who conducted a study on the effect of life skills training on general health in students and showed that life skills training is effective on nursing and midwifery students mental health ( p < 0.01  t = 11.2 ) . our results are consistent with the result of zamini et al . who studied the effect of nlp education on self - efficiency and problem solving among students . 
 our results showed that nlp education is notably effective on students mental health  indicating that students general health can be promoted through nlp education . 
 the results showed that the mean scores of mental health were 56.23 ( 14.7 ) and 53.72 ( 15.97 ) in nursing and midwifery groups  respectively  before education  showing no significant difference with regard to the course of study ( p = 0.561 ) . 
 but they were 17.36 ( 9.44 ) and 23.63 ( 12.06 ) in nursing and midwifery groups  respectively  after education  showing a significant difference with regard to the course of study ( p = 0.041 ) . 
 it can be concluded that mental health was higher in the nursing group after they were given nlp education  compared to the midwifery group . 
 in other words  nlp education had a notable effect on nursing students mental health promotion . 
 results of this study concerning mental health dimensions showed that anxiety was more influenced by education in nursing students  which needs further studies investigating more dimensions in this regard . 
 the obtained results are consistent with of the result of sahebalzamani et al . reporting the effect of expression skill education on self - esteem and decisiveness of high - school girls ( p = 0.000 ) . 
 with regard to the increasing changes and sophistication of society and development of social communications  preparation of individuals  especially the young generation  for facing difficult situations is an essential issue . since iran has a young population  and unfortunately 
  corruption and social assaults have increased in recent years  the policy makers of education and training system and the related authorities should essentially have plans to lower the corruption and assault and to increase job opportunities in the society and create jobs for students . 
 our results showed that nlp education can promote individuals mental health level . by providing nlp education skills including setting a goal  time management  and the skill of self - expression in the form of nlp 
 nlp education  as public education  can increase the level of knowledge and have a positive effect on the various dimensions of human life . 
 as students are the future investment of the society  their mental health is of great importance . 
 a family is the first place for children to experience a common life and so ciability . 
 therefore  based on the findings  it is suggested to consider nlp education along with other educational courses  not only to promote individuals general health but also to lower depression  anxiety  social function reduction  and physical problems  which will prevent mental and physical disorders .","

1) Abstract: In this study, the efficacy of neurolinguistic programming (NLP) training on mental health in nursing and midwifery students was investigated. Data was collected using a 28-item version of the Goldberg General Health Questionnaire, and NLP training was given over five 120-minute sessions. Significant improvements were seen in mental health, physical signs, anxiety, social function, and depression scores.

2) Research and Discussion: The study population comprised of 52 nursing and midwifery students from Islamic Azad University, Tehran Medical Branch. Through random sampling, they were assigned to two groups, with one receiving NLP training and the other acting as a control. Results showed significant improvements in various dimensions of mental health, indicating the effectiveness of NLP strategies.

3) Results and Conclusion: Paired t-tests revealed significant improvements in mental health, physical signs, anxiety, social function, and depression scores in both the nursing and midwifery groups. This demonstrates the potential of NLP to improve general health and its various dimensions. As such, structured and executive NLP programs should be considered for implementation among students."
"polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ) which was first reported in 1935 is known as one of the most common endocrine hormones disorders in the women of the reproductive age afflicting as many as % 10 of them . 
 the name of this syndrome has been derived from the appearance of the ovaries of the afflicted women ( an ovary of enlarged size and full of cysts ) . 
 these cysts are in the form of follicles filled with liquid sacs full of developed ovum . due to the lack of a set of standard and unified diagnostic criteria  the rate of prevalence of this syndrome reported in the different studies is varied . 
 some studies which used sonography as their diagnostic criteria found that the prevalence of pcos ranged between 21% and 22% respectively . on the contrary  in some other studies using oligomenerrhea and hyperandrogenemia manifestations as the pcos 's diagnostic criteria  
 this syndrome accounts for 30 - 40% of the common causes of infertility resulting from ovary dysfunctions . 
 in addition  pcos is considered as the most leading cause of ovary disorders . as recent studies indicate  a person may have pcos without showing one or some of the above - mentioned symptoms  some other symptoms and signs which can be enumerated for pcos are as follows : increased androgenic hormones  metabolic syndrome ( insulin resistance )  fat - related disorders  type 2 diabetes  cardiovascular disease  endometrial cancer and blood pressure . 
 the patients with pcos also suffer from anxiety and depression some symptoms which are believed to be mostly a result of disorders occurred in the reproduction cycle which is naturally completed by releasing an ovum every month . 
 the exact cause of pcos is not yet completely known  however  some factors such as insulin resistance / hyperinsulinaemeia  obesity  heredity and genetics factors  environmental factors such as exposure to high levels of masculinizing hormones  embryonic life cycle - related factors  hyperandrogenemia  gonadotropins secreting and functioning  hyperprolactinemia  hypothyroidism or thyroid - related dysfunctions  diet all may play a part in developing pcos . according to previous studies  the eating habits are not different between patients with pcos and healthy persons but some foods seem to affect hormone parameters . in the year 2008  one case - control study was carried out in al - zahra hospital of the city of tabriz  iran in which 60 women were studied  the results showed that the intake amounts of ca  mg  d vitamin  dairy  fruits and nuts and seeds were remarkably low among the women with pcos . 
 the frequency of their milk and dairy intakes products was also lower compared with the healthy women ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 another study by billaudel et al . revealed that d vitamin and calcium play a critical role in insulin secretion and insulin - resistance in human and animal models . 
 another research on 103 women with pcos and 103 healthy women provided some evidence on the decreased amount of adiponectine  calcium  d vitamin in the patients suffering from pcos with having a higher thyroglobulin . 
 there was also a significant correlation between adioponectrine and calcium concentrations ( oh - d 25 ) . 
 in one prospective study on 3157 young women aged 18 - 30  pereira et al . have reported in 2002 that the amount of dairy intake and insulin - resistance were indirectly related . a study by pereira et al . 
 found an inverse relationship between consuming more than 4 units of dairy products per day and metabolic syndrome in the females . 
 as indicated in previous research  diet and dairy intake which itself is a source of calcium not only can trigger pcos condition  but also may directly affect obesity and insulin - resistance  two factors which themselves act as the causes of pcos . 
 numerous studies have demonstrated the association between the diet and its components and risk factors developing various diseases . 
 however  previous studies did not address the relationship between nutrition choices and type of diet chosen by the patients . 
 the adverse health effects of pcos such as infertility  diabetes  cardiovascular diseases and the growth in its prevalence  can impose huge financial and health costs on the society and can affect affecting many families . therefore  
 however  the number of studies which have addressed the relationship between dairy intake and pcos is limited . 
 hence  the present study intends to explore the relationship between the amount of dairy intake and pcos . 
 as a descriptive cross - sectional study  the present research tried to find the relationship between the amount of dairy consumption and pcos condition in 400 women who referred to shahid beheshti hospital clinic in 2013 . as far as exclusion and inclusion criteria of the study 
 is concerned  it is noteworthy that the criteria for the inclusion in the study were willingness to participation  lack of precocious puberty  not having uterus cancer and not being pregnant . on the contrary  the subjects were excluded from the study if they were unwilling to participation  did not respond to more than 30 food items included in the food frequency questionnaire ( ffq )  diagnosed with typical ( chronic ) diseases having to follow a specific diet . at the start of the study  
 the data related to the food intakes were checked by the researcher using ffq  ( in the ffqs the person were asked how often they consumed certain foods from a given l of foods ) the validity and reliability of which were previously confirmed . 
 the data on the history of developing ovary dysfunctions ( any endocrine disorders related to reproductive system )  genetics background ( having first related family members with ovarian disease )  the age of the first menstruation  the history of thyroid diseases  the patients medication history ( any kind of medicine used or any surgery )  the period of developing pcos and physical activity were collected by a nutritious expert using a self - developed questionnaire . 
 to do so  the weight ( kg ) of the participants was measured with clothes but without shoes . 
 the height of the participants was measured in a normal condition without wearing shoes using a strip tape . the body mass index ( bmi ) 
 was calculated by dividing the weight ( kg ) value by the square root of height ( m ) value . 
 the pcos condition was identified through sonography diagnostic assessment with checking patients clinical manifestations performed by a trained authority . 
 data analysis was performed by descriptive analysis and logistic regression tests using spss software version 15 . for age  age at menarch and bmi t - test was applied . 
 mann - whitney t - test was applied for kcal while for other variables chi - square test was applied [ table 1 ] . as shown in table 2 for all variables mann - whitney test were used . 
 the study 's confidence coefficient was considered at 95% and the level of strength of the study at 80% . 
 furthermore  the ratio of pcos - afflicted patients and the sampling error were assumed to be 50% and 0.07%  respectively .

 frequency ( % ) and central tendency ( spread ) of some health condition characteristics of participants frequency ( % ) and central tendency ( spread ) of food intake characteristics of sample population study 
 this study was carried out on 400 women of an mean  standard deviation ( sd ) age of 29.5  4.8 years old and an mean  sd bmi of 24.1  4.8 admitted to the shahid beheshti hospital . 
 the prevalence of pcos in the persons in the study was found to be 9.9% . 
 based on the primary analyses on the data ( descriptive analysis )  there was relationship between the history of ovarian diseases  genetics and the use of medications and pcos . 
 no relationship was observed between pcos and other variables [ table 1 ] . as for the history of ovarian diseases 
  there was statistically significant difference between the patients with pcos and healthy people ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 as for the family history  a similar result was obtained so that 22.6% of the patients with pcos were revealed having a family history of pcos . 
 on the contrary  there was no significant relationship between physical activity and pcos ( p = 0.86 ) . 
 a significant relationship was also observed between the use of medications and pcos ( p  0.001 ) . 
 the pcos - afflicted patients and healthy persons did not show any difference in terms of weight and bmi . 
 the average age of the patients with pcos was 26.7 compared to 29.8 as the average age of the healthy persons . 
 the two groups also differed in terms of the amount of calorie intake with 4247 kcal for the subjects with pcos and 6410 kcal for the healthy subjects . 
 the average age of the first menstrual period was found to be 13.35 years among the healthy individuals and 13.02 years among the individuals afflicted with pcos [ table 1 ] . 
 the average sum of dairy intake was 581.5 and 611 g for the healthy persons and patients with pcos  respectively [ table 2 ] . 
 the results from using logistic regression revealed that there was no association between genetics and pcos ( p = 0.13 ) [ table 3 ] . on the contrary 
 ( p < 0.001 odds ratio [ or ] = 0.2 confidence interval [ ci ] ( 95% ) = 0.082 - 0.490 )  age ( p < 0.001  or = 0.85 ci ( 95% ) = 0.787 - 0.934 ) and the use of medication as three confounding variables ( p = 0.001 or = 0.17 ci ( 95% ) = 0.064 - 0.477 ) and pcos [ table 3 ] . based on the results  bmi and pcos were not significantly related but their relationship may be remarkable ( p = 0.068 ) . 
 every one - unit increase in the bmi was accompanied by an increase in the risk of affliction with pcos . 
 although like bmi  this relationship was not significant but remarkable ( p = 0.088 ) . 
 after modifying the effects of confounding variables  a direct significant relationship was found between the intake of milk and pcos ( p = 0.028 ) so that every 1-unit increase in the milk intake led to a % 1-increase in the risk factors [ table 3 ] . 
 in the present study we evaluated the effects of dairy product on pcos . according to the results of this study  no significant relationship was observed between each component of dairy foods group and other variables with pcos . 
 however  after modifying the effects of confounding variables  it was found that the milk intake and pcos were directly related . 
 very few studies have been conducted on exploring the direct effect which dairy foods may have on pcos . 
 the results of empirical research on the effect of dairy foods on the weight which itself is believed to be one of the effective factors of infliction with pcos are inconsistent without producing a rigid and strong outcome . 
 the results of available clinical evaluations especially those who address the effects of a diet rich in dairy foods on the weight do not yield a fixed outcome . 
 the results of some previous studies are in line with our results . according to adebamowo et al . 
  there is a relationship between slim / low - fat or free - fat milk and increased frequency of acne  a component of the pcos . 
 two intervention studies ( thompson et al . and harvey - berino  et al . ) provided no evidence on an additional weight loss when choosing a diet rich in dairy foods compared with a low - dairy diet . 
 the results of these studies were similar to those of one earlier research by   zemel et al . 
 ( 2004 ) with a study period of 12 weeks . however  the periods of these two recent studies in which no association was observed between the variables in question was 48 weeks and 52 weeks  respectively . 
 the findings of a 3-year prospective study on a large number of children and young adults revealed that the subjects with a higher intake of milk had a higher bmi . 
 although this reported increase was very trivial per year  adjusting for a number of body weight factors  it was statistically significant . 
 chavarro et al . in their prospective cohort study found that high intake of low - fat dairy products may lead to an increase in the women 's risk of ovulation - related infertility  while incorporating more high - fat dairy foods may decrease its risk . 
 ( 1994 ) reported a positive association between intakes of milk and age - related decreased fertility rates in 31 nations . to put it differently  consuming milk 
 gunther et al . in their study divided 155 women of normal weight into three sub - categories as per their amount of dairy foods intake within 1 year  while their diets during intervention were the same in terms of caloric value . 
 although the results of the study did not support the hypothesis related to the dairy foods intake and weight loss  following 51 of the healthy women participating in the study for a 6-month period after the study revealed that compared to those with a low intake of dairy foods  those who had a diet of high dairy intake had a lower fat accumulation . 
 results of some previous studies are not in line with our findings . in two studies by zemel 
 a considerable decrease was reported for bmi and waist circumference with a notable decrease in the plasma insulin . in one case - control study  
 dixon  et al . argued that there is an intricate association between obesity and dairy products intake concluding that for the children of higher age  there was an inverse association between the intake of dairy foods and obesity . by analyzing a number of databases  
 a group of cross - sectional studies on the adults and children almost demonstrated the inverse relationship between the intake of dairy foods and initial obesity . 
 the samples used in these studies were mostly selected from among post - menopausal middle - aged women . 
 carruth and skinner in their research on a group of preschool children concluded that the number of servings estimated per day is obviously inversely related to the fat accumulation and positively related to the individuals slimness . 
 in particular  each serving resulted in an additional weight loss up to 0.9 - 1.1 kg . 
 as for consuming dairy foods and insulin resistance relationship  a cross - sectional study conducted on 496 samples of participants aged 20 - 68 aged in 2009 can be enumerated . 
 this study tried to assess the amounts of consumed dairy foods using a food history questionnaire the validity of which had been checked . 
 based on the results  compared with other groups  the samples situated on the top quarter of the intake of dairy products had the lowest mean scores for insulin resistance markers . 
 although the observed differences were not statistically significant  eating whole - fat dairy products was inversely associated with homa - ir . in contrast  there was no relationship between low - fat dairy products and insulin resistance markers . 
 a case - control study by keshavarzi demonstrated that the risk of infertility among the women who ate 3 or more glasses of milk per day was lower than those with no intake of milk as much as 70% . 
 most of these studies were done on obese subjects  children or on adolescents . on the whole 
  the findings of this study indicated that there was no statistically significant relationship between consuming milk  yogurt  sherbet / frozen yogurt  cheese and cream and pcos . 
 conversely  it became evident that pcos and the history of ovarian diseases ( p < 0.001 )  age ( p < 0.001 ) and the use of medication ( p = 0.001 ) as three confounding variables were inversely related . furthermore  although no statistically significant relationship was obtained between bmi and pcos  it was at the threshold of being significant ( p = 0.068 ) . 
 every one - unit increase in bmi is associated with a 10% increase in the risk of pcos . of course  this relationship was no significant . 
 similar to bmi  this relationship was insignificant ( being at the threshold of significance  p = 0.0880 . 
 after modifying the effects of confounding variables  a statistically significant relationship was observed between milk intake and risk of pcos ( p = 0.028 ) hence that every 1-unit increase in the amount of milk consumed caused a 1%-increase in the risk of pcos . there is no study addressing the relationship between the history of ovarian diseases and pcos . as for the relationship between the use of medication and pcos  
 the research suggest that since the medications used by the majority of the participants were metformin  anti - fertility as well as thyroid medications  they helped prevent developing pcos due to their effect on androgen secretion and luteinizing hormone / follicle - stimulating hormone ratio . based on past research  the higher the age  makes the lower the possibility of pcos . affecting ovulation 
 however  it is noteworthy that yielding inconsistent results  few studies have addressed this issue . if the women with pcos or those who are suspicious of having it make some changes in their diets  for instance choosing low - fat dairy foods instead of high - fat ones  a positive relationship between these changes and anovulatory infertility would be expected . 
 foods factors relevant to the augmentation of the phenotype attributes of pcos may increase infertility risk due to disturbed ovulation . 
 the current study revealed that the average intake of milk and pcos had significant relationship . to explain more  on the average the total intake of low- and free - fat milk was estimated to be 52  61 ( gr ) and 55  132 ( gr ) for the healthy and patient individuals  respectively . 
 the average amount of low- and free - fat milk consumption was found to be 12.4  39.35 ( gr ) for the healthy persons and 76.55 ( gr ) for the pcos patients . 
 furthermore  the individuals with pcos condition  revealed to have a higher consumption of low- and free - fat milk . as per the results of the past studies  there is a positive relationship between low - fat milk and pcos . 
 low - fat dairy products may increase the level of insulin like growth factor i ( igf - i ) . as some researchers have controversies 
 the igf - i existing in the human ovarian cells may stimulate the cell activity - related changes observed in the pcos . 
 it is not yet known whether the change in the level of igf - i caused by diet may contribute to the pcos 's clinical manifestations or not . as the research suggest 
  the fatty acids of dairy products may have potential positive effects on the ovary function . in more details  
 the substance soluble in the fat available in the dairy products plays the essential role in creating such effects . compared with low - fat dairy products  whole milk and fat - rich dairy products 
 since estrogen can decrease the level of igf - i  their existence in high - fat dairy foods may explain the observed association . 
 the frequent increased insulin sensitivity in the high - fat dairy consumers may improve their ovulation performance . eating low - fat dairy foods 
 has also been accompanied by an excess of androgens secretion known as one of components of pcos . 
 one of the weak points of this study is its cross - sectional design which fails to identify the cause - effect relationships . 
 in addition  hormone tests such as thyroid  prolactine and homa - ir tests were not taken from the subjects . 
 in contrast  some strength points that can be mentioned for this study include : the large number of the samples  lack of similar study in iran directly addressing the relationship between dairy products intake and pcos  evaluating the foods intakes using a validated ffq  using sonography test known as the most reliable method for pcos diagnose . 
 based on the findings of the study  milk intake and prevalence of pcos may be related in some way . due to the adverse health effects of this condition  its high prevalence in the society as well as the shortage of research on the effectiveness of diets on preventing and treating it  the need to more research is felt . in the future research  it is better to address laboratory practices such as thyroid  prolactine and sexual hormones  as well .","

1) Abstract: This study aimed to assess the relationship between dairy consumption and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in young women. A cross-sectional study of 400 participants was conducted using a food frequency questionnaire and regression analysis to evaluate the associations between PCOS and various factors.

2) Research and Discussion: Factors such as insulin resistance, obesity, and diet are suggested to be associated with PCOS, but the cause is not completely understood. Additionally, limited research exists on the impact of dairy consumption on this disease. This study found a significant association between PCOS and ovarian disease, age, and medication use. There was also a direct relationship between milk consumption and risk of PCOS after adjusting for confounding factors.

3) Results and Conclusion: The results suggest that ovarian disease, age, and medication use are directly linked to PCOS. However, the study did not find a significant correlation between dairy consumption and PCOS. Interestingly, after controlling for other factors, there was a direct relationship between milk consumption and risk of PCOS. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of dairy in this endocrine disorder."
"milrinone  a phosphodiesterase iii inhibitor currently used to treat pediatric patients with cardiac diseases  increases the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the myocardium and vascular smooth muscle . 
 high levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate enhance the contractility of the myocardium by increasing calcium influx and relaxing vascular smooth muscles1 ) therefore increasing cardiac output and decreasing afterload . 
 milrinone also has a lusitropic property  which improves myocardial relaxation.2 ) unlike other inotropes such as dopamine  dobutamine  and epinephrine  milrinone is not associated with an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption.3 ) milrinone is widely used due to its inotropic  vasodilatory  and lusitropic properties . 
 it is frequently prescribed after cardiac surgery due to its efficacy in preventing low cardiac output syndrome.4 ) milrinone is also commonly administered to pediatric patients with myocarditis as a bridge therapy for patients with heart failure who are waiting for cardiac transplantation.5)6 ) milrinone has been shown to improve heart contractility in patients with septic shock.7 ) milrinone is currently one of the most commonly used off - label cardiovascular medications in children.8 ) although a few reports showed the efficacy and safety of short - term milrinone treatment ( for about 35 hours ) in children with heart disease9)10 ) the safety and efficacy of long - term use of milrinone in children is limited due to a lack of sufficient evidence - based studies in pediatric populations . 
 currently  milrinone is widely used for 3 days  which is usually based on extrapolation from studies in adults or clinical experience . 
 therefore  the objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the current pattern of milrinone administration for 3 days in pediatric patients . 
 a retrospective analysis was conducted using data collected from patients who received milrinone treatment for 3 days at the seoul national university children 's hospital from january 2005 to december 2012 . 
 patients were divided into two groups based on the indication for milrinone treatment : group a consisted of patients who received milrinone to prevent low cardiac output syndrome after cardiac surgeries whereas group b consisted of patients who received milrinone treatment due to acute heart failures from causes other than cardiac surgeries . 
 patients with the following conditions or those who underwent the following treatments were excluded from the study : 1 ) severe left ventricular outflow obstructive diseases such as aortic stenosis ; 2 ) hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathies ; 3 ) milrinone administration immediately after cardiopulmonary resuscitation ; 4 ) multi - organ failures ; 5 ) simultaneous administration of 3 inotropes other than milrinone to increase blood pressure ; 6 ) renal replacement therapies including peritoneal dialysis ; 7 ) myocardial infarctions ; 8) univentricular heart surgeries . 
 however  patients receiving 3 inotropes were included if inotropes were added after an interval of > 2 hours consecutively . 
 patients ' characteristics including age  sex  height  weight  and body surface area were recorded . 
 the following parameters were analyzed to identify the clinical application of milrinone : 1 ) initial infusion rate ; 2 ) maintenance continuous infusion rate ; 3 ) total duration of milrinone therapy ; 4 ) concomitantly infused inotropes . 
 the operation and anesthesiology records of patients who had undergone cardiac surgeries were also studied to identify data related to anatomic diagnosis  type of surgery  time of cardiopulmonary bypass  and time of aortic cross - clamping . 
 systolic blood pressure  heart rate  and echocardiographic data ( the left ventricular internal dimension at end - diastole  ejection fraction  and fractional shortening ) obtained before or immediately after starting milrinone treatment were compared to the values prior to treatment cessation . in cases 
 where appropriate echocardiographic data could not be obtained on the day milrinone treatment was discontinued  echocardiographic data obtained within a week of the treatment endpoint were used . 
 the safety of milrinone was determined based on the occurrence of adverse events such as hypotension  arrhythmia  chest pain  headache  hypokalemia  and thrombocytopenia . 
 hypotension was defined as a sudden decrease in blood pressure within two hours after starting milrinone that necessitated the addition of inotropes or cessation of milrinone . 
 arrhythmia was classified as supraventricular tachycardia  ectopic atrial tachycardia  atrial fibrillation / flutter  accelerated junctional rhythm  junctional ectopic tachycardia  ventricular tachycardia  or ventricular fibrillation . 
 evidence of chest pains or headache during milrinone use were collected from the patient 's chart . 
 potassium levels and platelet counts 24 to 48 hours after starting milrinone infusion were estimated . 
 changes in hemodynamic parameters and echocardiographic data were analyzed using a pairwise comparison test and the wilcoxon signed - rank test . 
 the frequency of hypokalemia and thrombocytopenia after milrinone infusion was analyzed using the mcnemar test . 
 univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between diverse variables  including the practical use of milrinone and the development of arrhythmia . for statistical analyses  
 descriptive data are presented as means and standard deviation  whereas categorical variables are presented as proportions . 
 data manipulation and statistical analyses were performed with statistical package for the social sciences ( spss ) 19.0 for windows ( spss inc .  somers  ny  usa ) and excel 2010 ( microsoft ) . 
 the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of seoul national university hospital and patient consent was waived due to the study 's retrospective design .

 the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of seoul national university hospital and patient consent was waived due to the study 's retrospective design . 
 in total  2299 eligible admissions were identified during the study period . of these admissions  
 a total of 730 admissions ( 684 patients ) met the inclusion criteria and were selected for the present study . 
 twenty - seven patients received milrinone twice and one patient received milrinone thrice after serial cardiac surgeries . 
 most patients ( 715  97.9% ) received milrinone to prevent low cardiac output after cardiac surgeries . 
 there were 715 admissions in group a and 15 admissions in group b. the male to female ratio was 5.6:1 . 
 the mean age of patients at the time of milrinone infusion was 0.82 years ( table 1 ) . in total  
 429 admissions ( 60% ) in group a underwent cardiac surgeries at less than 3 months of age . 
 the most common cardiac defect was ventricular septal defect in group a ( 42.4% )  followed by tetralogy of fallot ( 11% ) and coarctation of the aorta with ventricular septal defect ( 6.4% ) ( table 2 ) . 
 accordingly  the most common type of surgery was closure of the ventricular septal defect  followed by repair of tetralogy of fallot and coarctoplasty . in group b  
 the duration of milrinone treatment ranged from 3 to 64.4 days . in 149 ( 20.4% ) 
 two or more inotropes other than milrinone were used in 425 ( 59.4% ) admissions . 
 the most commonly infused inotrope in group a was dopamine ( 83.4% )  whereas all patients in group b received dobutamine ( table 3 ) . 
 systolic blood pressure  fractional shortening  and ejection fraction after milrinone treatment were significantly ( p<0.05 ) increased in group a when compared to values obtained immediately after cardiac surgeries . 
 however  there was no significant difference in systolic blood pressure  fractional shortening  and ejection fraction before and after milrinone treatment in group b. in both groups  heart rate was significantly ( p<0.05 ) reduced after milrinone use ( table 4 ) . 
 there were no reports of adverse events in the majority of admissions ( 78.7% ) ( table 5 ) . 
 although diverse arrhythmias occurred in 75 ( 10.3% ) admissions  only 3 ( 0.4% ) required reduction or discontinuation of milrinone infusion to alleviate arrhythmia . 
 two of them developed junctional ectopic tachycardia and one of them developed ectopic atrial tachycardia . 
 one - third of patients in group b as well as approximately 10% of patients in group a developed arrhythmia . in total  41 ( 58.6% ) of the 70 arrhythmias in group a were classified as junctional ectopic tachycardia  
 the development of arrhythmia was not influenced by the initial infusion rate  maintenance continuous infusion rate  or duration of milrinone treatment . 
 based on univariate logistic regression analysis of group a data  the following parameters were associated with the development of arrhythmia : male gender  age 3 months  and cardiopulmonary bypass time 180 minutes . 
 multivariate analysis of group a data in - dicated that male gender and cardiopulmonary bypass time 180 minutes influenced the development of arrhythmia . 
 however  the incidence rate did not increase significantly ( p=0.390 )  which was 108/730 ( 14.4% ) at the initial point and 118/730 ( 16.2% ) at 24 to 48 hours after starting milrinone treatment . 
 thrombocytopenia did increase slightly but significantly ( p=0.039 )  which occurred in 4/729 ( 0.5% ) at the initial point and 12/729 ( 1.6% ) at 24 to 48 hours after starting milrinone treatment . 
 most patients in group a with thrombocytopenia required only a few platelet transfusions after cardiac surgeries . 
 platelet count was increased and maintained 50000/dl spontaneously in 2 admissions  after 1 platelet transfusion in 6 admissions  and after 2 platelet transfusion in 2 admissions . the cardiopulmonary bypass time ( 249.272.8 minutes vs. 153.170.4 minutes ; 
 p=0.004 ) were significantly longer in group a patients with thrombocytopenia than in patients without thrombocytopenia . 
 the initial infusion rate  maintenance continuous infusion rate  and duration of milrinone treatment were not associated with thrombocytopenia . 
 two patients in group b had a low platelet count due to additional medical illnesses such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and fungal infection . 
 in total  2299 eligible admissions were identified during the study period . of these admissions

 p=0.004 ) were significantly longer in group a patients with thrombocytopenia than in patients without thrombocytopenia . 
 the initial infusion rate  maintenance continuous infusion rate  and duration of milrinone treatment were not associated with thrombocytopenia . 
 two patients in group b had a low platelet count due to additional medical illnesses such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and fungal infection . 
 in the present study  we reviewed the current patterns of milrinone use that continued for 3 days . 
 of a total of 2299 eligible admissions in which milrinone was used  730 ( 31.8% ) admissions involved the use of milrinone for 3 days . 
 although the korean national insurance covers only 35 hours of milrinone use  we found that milrinone was frequently prescribed for a longer duration in actual settings  suggesting a significant off - label use . 
 the frequent use of milrinone in pediatric patients undergoing heart surgery was supported by the findings of the prophylactic intravenous use of milrinone after cardiac operation in pediatrics ( primacorp ) trial  which demonstrated that low cardiac output syndromes could be prevented by high - dose milrinone infusion after pediatric cardiac surgeries.10 ) although the initial and maintenance milrinone infusion rates determined in the present study were lower than those previously reported in the primacorp study  our values were similar to those reported in other european practices.4)10 ) in terms of efficacy issue  fractional shortening and ejection fraction were both improved after milrinone infusion in group a patients  which is in consistent with previous findings.9)11 ) chang et al.9 ) reported that milrinone treatment in neonates with low cardiac output after congenital heart surgery improved the cardiac index without changing myocardial oxygen consumption . 
 duggal et al.11 ) documented that milrinone therapy improved the left and right myocardial performance index  a reliable index that reflects myocardial contractility . 
 our findings revealed no significant changes in fractional shortening and ejection fraction after milrinone infusion in group b  which is in contrary to previously reported data in adults.12 ) the severity of the disease in group b is likely to have some influence on the results . 
 seven ( 46.7% ) of the 15 admissions in group b involved patients who died due to underlying cardiac disease itself  reflecting the severity of disease in group b. in terms of safety  several adult studies have shown detrimental effects of milrinone on hemodynamic stability in chronic heart failures . the prospective randomized milrinone survival evaluation13 ) 
 trial revealed that oral administration of milrinone to patients with heart failure increased mortality and induced serious adverse cardiovascular events including hypotension . 
 the outcomes of a prospective trial of intravenous milrinone for exacerbations of chronic heart failure trial reported that sustained hypotension requiring additional treatment was more common in patients who received milrinone infusion for exacerbation of chronic heart failure.14 ) however  in the present study  only 1 ( 6.7% ) of 15 admissions in group b needed a reduction in milrinone dose due to a decrease in blood pressure  with the incidence of hypotension being lower than that reported previously in adult data . 
 furthermore  only 3 ( 0.4% ) of the 715 admissions in group a experienced hypotension that required a reduction in milrinone infusion rate . 
 this result was in consistent with previous pediatric data that reported an infrequent occurrence of hypotension in the milrinone treatment group after cardiac surgery.10 ) milrinone use has been known to be associated with postoperative arrhythmia in adults that increased mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery.15 ) arrhythmia is a concern following milrinone use in the pediatric population as well . 
 smith et al.16 ) recently reported that approximately half of the pediatric patients receiving milrinone after cardiac surgery experienced arrhythmia . in the present study  
 various arrhythmias occurred in 70 ( 9.8% ) of 715 admissions in group a. however  only 3 ( 0.4% ) admissions required modification of milrinone infusion to manage arrhythmias . 
 our finding is in consistent with that from other studies17)18 ) indicating that the incidence of arrhythmia due to milrinone use in pediatric patients is relatively low after cardiac surgery . 
 postoperative arrhythmia is associated with age  cardiopulmonary time  aortic cross clamping time  and type of repair.19)20 ) in the present study  the initial infusion rate  maintenance infusion rate  and duration of milrinone treatment were not associated with the development of arrhythmia . however  in consistent with the previous findings  a longer cardiopulmonary time affected the development of arrhythmia in group a ( table 6 ) . 
 junctional ectopic tachycardia is the most common type of arrhythmia after cardiac surgery.20 ) in the present study  the incidence rate of junctional ectopic tachycardia in group a was 5.7% . 
 this result is in accordance with previous studies  which reported that the incidence rate of junctional ectopic tachycardia after cardiac surgery range from 1.4% to 14.7%.21)22 ) the relationship between junctional ectopic tachycardia and milrinone use has not been elucidated thus far.23 ) a study in adults showed that atrial arrhythmia developed more frequently in patients with chronic heart failure who received milrinone treatment.14 ) however  the independent cause - effect relationship of milrinone with arrhythmia in pediatric patients with heart failure has not yet been established . 
 five ( 33.3% ) of the 15 admissions in group b involved patients who mainly developed ventricular arrhythmia . in the present study 
  there was no significant difference in initial infusion rate  maintenance infusion rate  or duration of milrinone treatment between patients with or without arrhythmia in group b. in fact  heart failure due to myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy itself increased the vulnerability of the patients to tachyarrhythmia and conduction disturbance.24 ) ichikawa et al.25 ) reported that 3 of 7 patients with fulminant myocarditis developed ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation . 
 friedman et al.26 ) also documented the high incidence rate of arrhythmia in pediatric idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy . 
 the incidence rate of thrombocytopenia in the present study was lower than that in previous studies . 
 ten ( 1.4% ) of the 715 admissions in group a involved patients who developed thrombocytopenia after milrinone treatment  which required a few platelet transfusions . 
 ramamoorthy et al.17 ) previously reported that milrinone treatment resulted in a high incidence ( 58% ) of thrombocytopenia ( platelet count < 100000/dl ) that did not often necessitate platelet transfusions . 
 bishara et al.18 ) further documented that 12.7% of admissions developed thrombocytopenia with milrinone treatment . 
 however  it is difficult to identify milrinone - induced thrombocytopenia  because various factors could confound the observations  including the cardiac surgery itself . 
 cardiopulmonary bypass is known to be associated with thrombocytopenia that results from hemodilution and mechanical disruption.27 ) in the present study  patients who developed thrombocytopenia had a longer cardiopulmonary bypass time and aorta - clamping time . 
 thus  patients with a more complex heart disease and longer bypass times during cardiac surgery would be more likely to develop thrombocytopenia . 
 in contrast to amrinone  the first phosphodiesterase inhibitor used that was known to have adverse effect on platelets  milrinone did not alter platelet count or function in patients after cardiac surgery.28 ) the fact that two ( 13.3% ) patients in group b developed thrombocytopenia could be due to complications such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and fungal sepsis  rather than due to milrinone use . 
 the utility of chronic continuous milrinone infusion for heart failure as bridge therapy to heart transplantation was proposed in a recent adult study.6 ) mcmahon et al.29 ) demonstrated that long - term support with milrinone was safe and effective in infants with cardiomyopathy awaiting heart transplantation . 
 outpatient continuous parenteral inotropic therapy  including milrinone  has also been used in inotropic - dependent children with advanced heart failure.30 ) although these studies used small patient populations  the incidence of complications was sufficiently low to indicate the safe and effective potential of milrinone use in infants and children with heart diseases . 
 this study had a retrospective design which did not have a control group containing patients who did not receive milrinone . moreover  all arrhythmias could not be included due to the study 's retrospective nature . 
 furthermore  because the exclusion criteria of this study were relatively strict to appropriately clarify the efficacy and safety of milrinone use and reduce confounding factors  the patients who would be more susceptible to milrinone use could not be included . in surgically treated patients with congenital heart disease 
  we should have also considered the natural improvement of cardiac function after the corrective operation  which could be a confounding factor for evaluating the efficacy of milrinone use in this study . 
 finally  only a few echocardiographic data including ejection fraction and fractional shortening were used to evaluate milrinone efficacy due to the retrospective study design .

Abstract: The use of milrinone for 3 days in children with heart diseases was assessed for safety and efficacy. Retrospective analysis of 730 admissions showed improvement in ventricular function and minimal adverse events. Milrinone could be safely employed in pediatric patients with heart diseases. 

Research and Discussion: Milrinone is commonly used in children with heart diseases to prevent low cardiac output after cardiac surgery. Lack of long-term studies prompted a retrospective analysis of 730 admissions, finding most patients had positive outcomes with minimal adverse events. Milrinone can be safely employed for 3 days in pediatric patients with heart diseases.

Results and Conclusion: 730 admissions were reviewed to assess the safety and efficacy of milrinone use for 3 days in children with heart diseases. Majority of patients showed improvement in ventricular function and minimal adverse events. This suggests that milrinone could be safely employed for 3 days in pediatric patients with heart diseases, particularly after cardiac surgery."
"brown - squard syndrome ( bss )  which occurs due to dysfunction of the spinothalamic tract  typically reflects the hemisection of the spinal cord at the cervical or thoracic level . 
 the syndrome mainly occurs as a result of penetrating trauma  syringomyelia  hematomyelia  tumor  severe discs  or blunt trauma . among the multiple etiologies  the most common cause is penetrating trauma  such as a gunshot78 ) . 
 therefore  most management guidelines focus on penetrating cervical injuries and/or vertebral artery ( va ) injury12 ) . non - missile penetrating spinal cord and 
 va injuries are rare because of the bony structures that protect the spinal cord and va14 ) . 
 thus  the treatment approach for wounds caused in non - missile penetrating spinal injuries such as a knife  a power drill bit  or even a pen could be different from common missile penetrating injuries561317).to our knowledge  there are few reports in the literature of complete obstruction of the va due to penetration of a foreign body through the neural foramen into the spinal canal . 
 herein  the authors report on va dissection and bss caused by penetration of an electric screw driver bit . 
 a 25-year - old machine operator was involved in a violent episode and was stabbed in his right neck with an electric screw driver bit that was thrown by the opponent . on arrival at the emergency department  
 the electric screw driver bit was placed in the right lateral aspect of the neck at zone i ( fig . 
 the tip of the electric screw driver bit was located at the center of the vertebral canal of c3 ( fig . 
 he was given high - dose methylprednisolone ( bolus dose of 30mg / kg followed by 5.4mg / kg / hour for 23 hours ) according to the protocol for spinal cord injury . 
 an immediate interventional angiography was undertaken without general anesthesia due to the nature of the emergency . 
 the angiography revealed a total occlusion with dissection of the right va at the level of c3 . 
 immediate coil embolization at both proximal and distal ends of the injury site was performed ( fig . 
 an attempt at manual extraction of the electric screw driver bit failed with great resistance . 
 after the patient was moved to the operating room  the electric screw driver bit was removed manually with muscle dissection under general anesthesia . 
 venous blood spilled out and was controlled easily by application of several pieces of gelatin sponge . 
 no postoperative complications such as wound dehiscence  cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) leakage  or infection were observed . 
 the neurological motor function of the right upper and lower extremities recovered to 3/5 and 4/5  respectively  with persistent decreased sensory function after one year . 
 fortunately  the patient experienced no neck swelling  auscultation of a neck bruit  or delayed ischemic complications . 
 penetrating injury is the third most frequent cause of spinal cord injury in adults  surpassed only by traffic accidents and falls318 ) . 
 stab wounds are associated with lesser surrounding tissue injury than gunshot wounds because the former delivers less energy than missile injuries9 ) . 
 although vascular injury is the most common sequel of penetrating neck trauma  va injury is rare because it is well protected by the transverse foramen410 ) . 
 therefore  penetrating injury of the va is mostly caused by gunshot wounds which deliver large kinetic energy  depending upon the bullet 's mass and speed12 ) . in this article  we report a rare case of va penetration by an electric screw driver bit with spinal cord insult  consequently presenting as bss . moreover  
 surgical exploration of the va can cause additional damage to the spine and surrounding tissues . 
 therefore  it may be reasonable to embolize an occluded artery  because the unilateral ligation of the va rarely results in brainstem ischemia1116 ) . 
 there are a few reports regarding the treatment of traumatic va injury such as the arteriovenous fistulas and pseudoaneurysms2 ) . 
 emergent surgical exploration is necessary for patients with hard signs of vascular injury  such as hemodynamic instability  hemorrhage exsanguinations  or expanding hematoma15 ) . 
 patients that are hemodynamically stable and who are without respiratory compromise should undergo further diagnostic imaging evaluation15 ) . as presented in this case  
 endovascular techniques were a safe and effective method of treatment and were not associated with significant morbidity or mortality1 ) . 
 airway management  intubation methods  and surgical positions can be points of debate between anesthesiologists and surgeons9 ) . if a lacerated va can be successfully obliterated  a penetrating electric screw driver bit may be extracted without general anesthesia . 
 nevertheless  the authors recommend that surgeons should be prepared for conversion to open surgery and extraction should be performed with the support of a surgical team . 
 we initially tried to extract the electric screw driver bit manually without general anesthesia in the intervention theater after va embolization . 
 however  the electric screw driver bit was positioned firmly in the neural foramen  and the patient complained of severe pain when the electric screw driver bit was being pulled out . 
 in addition  there was more important rationale that justified surgical exploration for extraction of the electric screw driver bit . on extraction of the electric screw driver bit  
 the authors describe a rare case of penetrating cervical injury caused by an electric screw driver bit with accompanying va penetration and bss .","


1) Abstract
This case report describes a rare incident of vertebral artery obstruction caused by an electric screw driver bit penetration resulting in Brown-Squard syndrome. Immediate endovascular treatment was successful in managing the condition without any postoperative complications.

2) Research and Discussion
This case highlights the potential risks and consequences of accidental penetration of the vertebral artery by foreign objects. Prompt diagnosis and endovascular intervention can prevent severe neurological sequelae. Further research is needed to establish guidelines for managing similar cases.

3) Results and Conclusion
Emergent endovascular embolization of the vertebral artery, followed by extraction of the foreign object, successfully managed the vertebral artery obstruction in this case. This approach proved to be a safe and effective treatment option with no postoperative complications. Further case studies and research can provide valuable insights into the management of such rare spinal injuries."
"vogt - koyanagi - harada disease ( vkh ) is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder affecting the eyes  auditory system  meninges  and skin [ 1  2 ] . 
 it is one of the most common causes of uveitis in asia and accounts for approximately 16% of all uveitis cases in china . 
 clinically  vkh is divided into four stages : prodromal  acute  convalescent  and chronic recurrent . 
 exudative retinal detachment is a common cause of visual function impairment among vkh patients  but secondary alterations in retinal morphology and function also occur [ 5  6 ] . due to advancements in retinal imaging  such as fundus autofluorescence ( faf ) 
 [ 7  8 ] and optical coherence tomography ( oct ) [ 9  10 ]  important clinical insight into the pathophysiology of the retina can be achieved noninvasively . 
 recent studies report a significant association of the inner segment ( is)/os junction and the cone outer segment tips ( cost ) line in various retinal diseases with visual function [ 1113 ] . 
 however  the majority of previous studies have used best corrected visual acuity ( bcva ) as a measure of visual function . 
 recently  microperimetry was found to provide a more comprehensive assessment of macular sensitivity and functional changes in the macula [ 14  15 ] . 
 we investigated the characteristics of late - stage vkh via oct  especially photoreceptor microstructure integrity and its potential correlation to visual function . 
 patients with late - stage vkh ( defined as 12 months from disease onset ) who visited the uveitis clinic at fudan university eye and ent hospital ( shanghai  china ) between april 2011 and march 2013 were enrolled in this cross - sectional study . 
 the diagnosis of vkh was made according to the revised diagnostic criteria proposed by the international nomenclature committee . 
 the inclusion criteria were treatment with high - dose corticosteroid therapy ( iv methylprednisolone at 1  g / d for 3  d ) followed by a slow tapering of the drug dose over a 6-month period  undergoing a thorough examination  including oct and microperimetry  and providing the required information at the 12-month follow - up  including sex  age at vkh onset  bcva at initial presentation  current bcva  interval from the onset of vkh symptoms to the initiation of high - dose corticosteroid treatment  and current ocular inflammatory status . 
 exclusion criteria were inadequate mydriasis ( < 7  mm )  media opacities ( caused by cataract or other )  and glaucoma ( defined as characteristic optic nerve damage or typical visual field defects accompanied by compatible optic nerve damage ) . 
 this study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the declaration of helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee of the fudan university eye and ent hospital . 
 1.5.12.0  heidelberg engineering  heidelberg  germany ) using the volume scan mode ( 1024  25 ; 25 lines  1024 a - scans per line  each line comprising 30 averaged scans obtained using eye tracking )  which covered a 30  30 degree area centered on the fovea . 
 microperimetry covered the central 12 of the macula ; therefore  only nine scans at the central macula ( firstly the scan across the central fovea was found and then subsequent four scans in both the superior and inferior directions were picked )  which covers about 12 of the central macula  were selected for further analysis . 
 changes in the is / os junction  the cost line  and the rpe layer were graded by an experienced ophthalmologist ( chunhui jiang )  who was masked for the clinical and other findings of the patients . 
 grading was performed using a scale from 1 to 3 based on a standardized protocol ( table 1 ) . 
 also if one part of the outer nuclear layer ( onl ) was thinner than the other  or all onl was obviously much thinner than normal  then it was considered as thinning of onl . 
 based on a 42 staircase strategy on a set of 45 goldmann iii stimulating spots covering the central 12 of the fundus  all tests were performed using an automated pattern in which a 1 circle was the target . 
 the intensity of each stimulus was varied according to a 1-step ( 0.1log ) scale from 020 decibels ( db ) for an equivalent duration of 200  ms per step . 
 the software automatically calculated the mean sensitivity  which was defined as the average of all 45 scores . 
 all analyses were performed using a statistical software package ( spss for windows  ver . 
 differences in mp and bcva between groups of late - stage vkh eyes with different oct grading were examined using the mixed linear model test . 
 differences in each prognostic factor ( sex  age of onset  initial bcva  and interval from onset to treatment ) were analyzed using generalized estimation equations test . 
 the durations between patients who were still using systemic corticosteroids alone or in combination with an immunosuppressant or not at 12 months were analyzed using mann - whitney u test . 
 during the study period  34 vkh patients with a follow - up of longer than 12 months visited our clinic . 
 twenty - nine patients ( 15 males and 14 females  58 eyes ) who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study . the mean follow - up time was 12.2 months ( range 1214 months ) . 
 the mean age at onset was 34.24  10.67 years ( range 1265 years ) ; mean bcva at onset was 0.96  0.56 ( logmar  range 2.000 ) ; mean bcva at 12 months was 0.07  0.16 ( logmar  range 0.40 to 0.08 logmar ) ; and mean retinal sensitivity was 17.05  2.35  db ( range 9.920  db ) . at 12 months  16 of the 29 patients were still using systemic corticosteroids alone or in combination with an immunosuppressant . among them  10 patients were tapering down and using low - dose prednisone . 
 another six patients were receiving corticosteroids and cyclosporine prescribed at 3  mg / kg / d and were tapering  guided by the severity of ocular inflammation . 
 the oct findings in the late - stage vkh eyes were localized to the outer retina . 
 the findings included thickening of the rpe layer ( 28/58 eyes ) ; breakage or disappearance of the cost line ( 51/58 eyes ) and/or the inner segment / outer segment ( is / os ) junction ( 28/58 eyes ) ; and thinning of the outer nuclear layer ( onl ) ( 17/58 eyes ) . 
 the grading of the rpe  cost line  and is / os conjunction is listed in table 2 . 
 notably  all eyes displaying intact cost lines also displayed intact is / os junctions and normal rpe layers . however  23 of the 30 eyes displaying intact is / os junctions displayed fragmented ( grade 1  3 eyes ; grade 2  20 eyes ) cost lines . in 18 of the 51 eyes displaying fragmented cost lines ( grade 1 or 2 ) and in 16 of the 28 eyes displaying fragmented is / os junctions ( grade 1 or 2 )  the central fovea remained intact ( figures 1(a)1(c ) ) . 
 our analysis revealed a strong correlation between retinal sensitivity / bcva and the oct findings of the cost line  is / os junction  and rpe layer ( all p  0.01  table 2 ) ( figure 2 ) . 
 for clarification  the patients were categorized according to the cost line and is / os junction characteristics  which were graded as intact ( + ) or not (  ) ( table 3 ) . 
 the three groups had similar gender / age distributions ( table 3 ) but different bcva and retinal sensitivities . 
 the is / os+/cost+ group displayed the best retinal sensitivity and bcva ; furthermore  only this group displayed relatively normal retinal sensitivity ( table 3 ) . 
 the oct findings for the cost line and is / os junction displayed clear correlations to the interval from symptom onset to the initiation of high - dose corticosteroid treatment and usage of systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant at 12 months after onset ( table 3 ) . 
 the is / os+/cost+ group exhibited the smallest interval from symptom onset to treatment and no usage of systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant . 
 in contrast  11/23 and 21/28 patients in the is / os+/cost and is / os/cost groups were using systemic corticosteroids alone or in combination with an immunosuppressant . 
 patients who were using systemic corticosteroids alone or in combination with an immunosuppressant at 12 months had longer durations than those without ( using versus not using  median 30 versus 9  p < 0.0001 by the mann - whitney u test ) . 
 changes of the outer retina and rpe in late - stage vkh patients  including thickening of the rpe layer  disruption or loss of the cost line and is / os junction  and thinning of the onl  were clearly demonstrated by sd - oct . 
 further analysis revealed a close correlation between these oct findings  which also correlated to the bcva  retinal sensitivity  and clinical characteristics . 
 better oct findings correlated to better vision  prompt treatment at disease onset  and less incidence of systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant at 12 months after onset . clinical findings of late vkh patients vary greatly . da silva et al . 
 recently reported that  in late - stage vkh eyes ( > 6 months past disease onset )  grading by color fundus photos ( which was mainly based on diffuse fundus depigmentation or subretinal fibrosis ) correlated well with full - field electroretinogram ( erg ) results . 
 however  not all vkh patients had diffuse fundus depigmentation or subretinal fibrosis ; therefore  an objective method with higher resolution might be useful in the study of vkh patients with less fundus change . 
 oct is routinely used in the diagnosis and follow - up of many retinal diseases [ 913 ] . 
 reported defects in the is / os junction and multifocal thickening of the rpe in late - stage vkh patients . 
 however  the use of oct to identify retinal morphological changes in late - stage vkh patients has not been extensively studied [ 5  7  8  18 ] . 
 this study comprised a relatively large series of late - stage vkh patients  in whom oct clearly demonstrated retinal changes and rpe . 
 in addition to defects in the is / os junction and thickening of the rpe  thinning of onl and a high prevalence ( 51/58 ) of defects in the cost line were found  thereby indicating that oct is useful in the observation of late - stage vkh eyes . 
 all eyes displaying intact cost lines displayed normal is / os junctions or rpe layers  whereas those displaying intact is / os junctions or normal rpe layers displayed disrupted cost lines . 
 it has been reported in central serous chorioretinopathy   or macular hole   patients that the cost line is later to recover than are the is / os line and other characteristics . 
 notably  patients displaying cost line and is / os junction defects or loss at the perifovea exhibited intact structures at the central fovea . 
 the mechanism underlying this finding is not fully understood  but the high density of photoreceptors at the fovea may play an important role . alternatively  the cones at the fovea display a different configuration and arrangement than cones at other regions of the fundus  which might also explain these findings . whether these structures were preserved or were first to regenerate  studying 
 the mechanism behind this characteristic might improve our understanding of vkh and of the neuroprotection or neuroregeneration of the retina . 
 our study also demonstrated a strong correlation between the cost line and/or is / os junction integrity and visual function in late - stage vkh patients . 
 a former paper reported a similar correlation in patients with macular holes [ 12  20 ] . 
 however  bcva was employed as the measure of visual function in previous studies . this time  microperimetry  which provides a quantitative measurement of retinal sensitivity at the macula  
  we found that only the is / os+/cost+ eyes exhibited normal results ( is / os+/cost+ group : 19.56  0.36  db ; normal group : 19.1  0.9  db ) . 
 these results suggest that the presence or reappearance of an intact cost line might serve as a more sensitive indicator of photoreceptor functional status than that of the is / os junction . in accordance with yokota 's report of a higher cone density in eyes displaying intact cost lines than in eyes displaying disrupted cost lines  our finding supported fujita and itoh 's theory that the recovery of the cost line  but not the is / os junction  suggests enhanced restoration of the photoreceptors [ 11  12 ] . on the other hand  it might also suggest that retinal sensitivity measured by microperimeter appeared to be able to provide a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of macular function in late - stage vkh patients and might do the same in patients with other retinal diseases . 
 the oct findings were also related to the mean interval from symptom onset to the initiation of systemic steroid therapy and using of systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant at 12 months after onset ( table 3 ) . 
 therefore  the interval from symptom onset to the initiation of systemic steroid therapy is an important prognostic factor for patients with late - stage vkh . 
 chee reported that early treatment ( < 2 weeks ) of high - dose corticosteroids was associated with better visual results in vkh patients . 
 our is / os+/cost group displayed a relatively normal bcva and an average treatment interval of 20.22  13.12 days . 
 in contrast  only the cost+/is / os+ group exhibited normal retinal sensitivity  normal bcva  and treatment interval of 6.71  0.76 days . 
 this result suggests that more prompt treatment might be required to achieve complete restoration of macular structure and function . 
 the importance of prompt treatment was also suggested by the correlation with less incidence of systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant at 12 months after onset . 
 the strengths of our study include its well - defined population who underwent standard long - term follow - up . 
 a relatively large sample size was achieved by using sophisticated statistics like  mixed linear model  and others . 
 these methods correct the dependence of both eyes from the same patients  so both eyes of the patients could be included . the primary outcome measures used in this study ( 
 oct findings  microperimetry  retinal sensitivity  and bcva ) are largely objective measures that are easily quantifiable . 
 the study 's retrospective design is a limitation  as is the fact that longitudinal assessment of disease activity and visual function could not be assessed due to the use of a cross - sectional study design . 
 the mechanisms underlying particular findings  such as the preservation of the retinal structure at the fovea  are not fully understood . 
 further follow - up study might be able to tell us more about how these vkh patients recovered from their acute episode and how the functional and anatomic recovery were correlated . in summary  
 our study demonstrated a significant correlation between the oct findings and visual function in late - stage vkh patients  as determined via bcva and microperimetry . 
 the integrity of the cost line was more sensitive than that of the is / os junction . 
 moreover  prompt initiation of high - dose corticosteroid treatment was associated with improved prognosis for visual function  retinal structure  and less incidence of systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant at 12 months .",".

Abstract:

The optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings of patients with late-stage Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease were characterized and correlated with visual function. The OCT revealed that outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium were mainly affected, with changes in the cone outer segment tip (COST) line and inner segment/outer segment junction. The timing of high-dose corticosteroid treatment was also correlated with OCT findings.

Research and Discussion:

A retrospective review of patients with late-stage VKH disease showed strong correlation between OCT findings and macular function. Patients with intact COST lines demonstrated intact IS/OS and better visual function. Additionally, OCT and microperimetry findings may be useful for evaluating late-stage VKH, especially with respect to the COST line and retinal sensitivity.

Results and Conclusion:

Twenty-nine patients (58 eyes) with late-stage VKH disease were included in the study. OCT findings, particularly those related to the COST line and IS/OS junction, strongly correlated with macular function and the interval between symptom onset and initiation of high-dose corticosteroid treatment. These findings highlight the potential of OCT and microperimetry in evaluating later-stage VKH disease."
"over the past decade  protein separation techniques and peptide analysis by mass spectrometry have greatly improved  and qualitative and quantitative proteome comparisons have become powerful tools for defining the composition of complex proteomes and the functions of protein complexes.(1 ) current ion trap mass spectrometers  in particular  are very sensitive and have fast analysis times that enable the identification of hundreds of proteins in a single lc - ms / ms analysis . 
 however  obtaining comprehensive protein profiles from very complex samples  such as biological fluids or mammalian cell or tissue lysates  remains challenging due to the large number of proteins present in the sample over wide concentration ranges . to improve proteome coverage  
 samples typically are fractionated at either the protein level or peptide level  or both . 
 regardless of the initial fractionation methods used  the final step in most strategies involves analysis of tryptic peptides by lc - ms / ms . 
 however   undersampling  will occur  that is  only a subset of the peptides will be identified  if the complexity of these tryptic digests exceeds the analytical capacity of the mass spectrometer ( e.g.  when more peptides elute from the hplc column per unit time than can be analyzed  or low - abundance peptides are below the instrument detection limit ) . 
 a common observation when complex proteomes are analyzed is that the lists of proteins identified are often quite variable  which has raised concerns about the general value of proteomics for most applications  if it actually does have poor reproducibility . 
 typically  the identifications of abundant proteins are reproducible  while most of the variability is observed in lower - abundance proteins . 
 one strategy of achieving more comprehensive proteome coverage actually exploits this variability by simply performing repetitive lc - ms / ms analyses on each sample . 
 other strategies for increasing the number of proteins identified include prefractionating the proteome based on protein physical properties  improving separation of the peptide mixture at the hplc separation step  modifying the esi interface to enhance ionization  or adding an ion mobility spectrometry ( faims ) interface before the ion trap.(19 ) proteome coverage also can be improved at the data analysis stage by using high - mass - accuracy data(20 ) or improved data - process algorithms . 
 other strategies include a two - step method that reanalyzes the same sample with an inclusion list ( eliminating redundant precursor selection in the second analysis ) and a  replay run  that analyzes a sample twice from a single injection with targeted analysis of undersampled features in the replay run.(26 ) although each of these methods can achieve increased sensitivity  it is difficult to assess the relative importance of strategies that have not been directly compared in a single study due to variations in samples  study design  mass spectrometry platforms  data - analysis strategies used  and other laboratory - to - laboratory variations . 
 consequently  a number of direct comparisons of alternative analysis strategies have been conducted to identify the best analysis approaches for specific types of samples such as serum and cell or tissue lysates . 
 factors that should be considered when comparing alternative analysis strategies are the amount of total protein required for the analysis and the total amount of mass spectrometry instrument time required by each method . 
 it is now well - established that repetitive lc - ms / ms analyses  longer hplc gradients  or additional fractionation  via either more fractions or more modes of separation of complex proteomes  will usually confer some benefit in terms of depth of analysis . 
 the key factor is to determine the most time- and resource - effective strategies for achieving a high depth of analysis  as these factors directly affect sample throughput and proteome analysis cost . in this study 
  we compared the effects of two commonly used strategies : gelc - ms / ms with repetitive lc - ms / ms analysis and additional protein prefractionation and assessed their effects on depth of analysis and reproducibility using cancer cell lysates . 
 neither strategy requires expensive special hardware or reagents  and both have been integrated into diverse analyses of complex proteomes by multiple laboratories . 
 because of its simplicity  repetitive analysis often has been used to increase protein identifications after different fractionation schemes  most of which involve two dimensions of separation at either the peptide or protein levels  such as mud - pit or gelc . 
 utilizing a cell extract of the human metastatic melanoma cell line 1205lu(31 ) the gelc - ms / ms analysis with and without repetitive injections was compared and these data sets were compared to a 3-d method that included the prefractionation of the cell lysate using microscale solution isoelectrofocusing ( microsol ief ) prior to the sds - page separation . to balance the total number of lc - ms / ms runs and total instrument time between the repetitive 2-d method and the 3-d method  the 20 fractions from the sds - page fractionation each were analyzed four times and the cumulative result was compared with the 80-fraction proteome analysis using the 3-d approach . 
 other factors such as hplc gradient  mass spectrometry method  and data processing were kept uniform to demonstrate clearly the relative effects of repetitive analyses versus an additional prefractionation step at the protein level . 
 these comparisons showed excellent reproducibility between the methods  and substantially improved proteome coverage using the 3-d method compared with the repetitive analysis of fractions from the 2-d method . 
 rpmi-1640 cell culture medium  sypro ruby stain  and nupage precast gels were from invitrogen corporation  carlsbad  ca .

 the bradford protein assay kit was from thermo fisher scientific  waltham  ma  and sequencing - grade porcine trypsin was from promega corporation  madison  wi . 
 the human melanoma 1205lu cell line was maintained in rpmi-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum . 
 cells were harvested on ice by scraping in cold phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) with inhibitors ( 0.3 mm pmsf  2 mm sodium orthovanadate  50 mm sodium fluoride  1 g / ml leupeptin  1 g / ml pepstatin ) when 7090% confluence was reached . 
 the tissue culture plates then were washed three times in cold pbs with inhibitors ; the washes were collected  combined with the initial scraped cells  collected by centrifugation  and the cell pellet was quick frozen in liquid nitrogen followed by storage at 80 c . 
 cell lysates were prepared using 800 l of lysis buffer ( 25 mm tris  ph 8.0  8 m urea  2 m thiourea  4% chaps  1 mm dtt ) per cell pellet collected from a 15-cm tissue culture dish . 
 the lysate was sonicated with a probe sonicator on ice with a duty cycle setting of 50% and an output level < 5% . 
 insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100  000 g for 60 min and was estimated to be < 1% of the total protein based on staining intensity of colloidal coomassie sds gels . 
 the supernatant was reduced using dtt and alkylated with n  n - dimethylacrylamide ( dma )  as previously described.(11 ) total protein in the supernatant was measured using the bradford method . 
 cell lysates ( 1.5 mg ) were separated into four ph ranges by microsol ief using a zoom ief fractionator ( invitrogen corporation  carlsbad  ca ) . for these separations  
 the fractionator contained five immobiline gel disks  each sustaining a ph of 3.0  5.4  6.2  7.0  and 12  respectively . 
 these disks delineated four separation chambers and the cell lysate in a sample buffer consisting of 8 m urea  2 m thiourea  4% chaps  1% dtt  1% ph 37 zoom focusing buffer  and 1% ph 712 zoom focusing buffer was loaded into the middle two separation chambers . 
 the outer chambers were loaded with sample buffer only and standard electrode solutions were used . 
 samples were focused at a constant 750 v and a maximum of 1 ma for 3 h. the solution in each sample chamber was removed and measured . each chamber was rinsed with a small volume of sample buffer so that  when combined with the original solution removed from that chamber  the final volume was 700 l . proteins trapped in the immobiline gel disks were recovered using two sequential 175 l extractions for 30 min each using 10 mm tris  ph 8  1% sds for 30 min . 
 the cell lysate and microsol ief fractions were initially analytically separated on 10% nupage minigels ( with mes running buffer ) using standard separation conditions . 
 preparative sds - page was run using unfractionated cell lysate and the four microsol ief fractions in an analogous manner to the analytical run  except the separation distance was limited to 40 mm to minimize required numbers of fractions and gel volume per fraction . 
 typically  six lanes  two lanes from the gelc ( 2-d ) method containing 60 g each of cell lysate and one lane each from the 3-d method  were sliced into 4 mm  1 mm  1 mm thick gel pieces . 
 two adjacent pieces in each lane were combined in a digestion well and were digested overnight with trypsin . 
 corresponding digestions from the duplicate 2-d method lanes were combined  generating a total of 20 digestions for the 2-d method . 
 trypsin digestions were injected into a 75 m i.d .  15 cm picofrit ( new objective  inc .

 may  2007 ) protein database  which was downloaded from the protein information resource at georgetown university . to generate the decoy database  the protein amino acid sequence for each database entry 
 was reversed and the entire reversed database was appended in front of the original forward sequences . 
 the data were searched against the combined forward / reverse database using partial trypsin specificity with a 2.5 da precursor mass tolerance and 1 da fragment ion mass tolerance . 
 consensus protein lists were generated by dtaselect ( ver 1.9  licensed from scripps research institute  la jolla  ca ) after applying the following filters : full tryptic boundaries  xcorr  1.8 ( z = 1 )  2.1 ( z = 2 )  3.25 ( z = 3 )  cn  0.05 . 
 custom software was then used to ensure that each unique peptide sequence was used only once in assembling the protein list . to identify common and unique proteins found by 2-d and 
 3-d methods  protein and peptide data were put into a relational database ( mysql ) and matched using custom software . 
 the strategy used to compare ( 1 ) the conventional gelc - ms / ms method ( protein separation by sds gel + reverse - phase peptide separation )  ( 2 ) gelc - ms / ms with repetitive injections  and ( 3 ) a 3-d method that used microsol ief fractionation prior to the sds - page step ( protein ief + sds gel + reverse - phase peptide separation ) is summarized in figure 1 . to directly compare the relative impact on proteome coverage of repetitive injections versus an additional protein separation step 
  equal amounts of the same cell lysate were fractionated and an equal number of lc - ms / ms analyses were used . 
 a cell lysate of 1205lu cell line was processed in such a manner that each common step was comparable . 
 the 3-d method consisted of microsol ief  sds - page  and lc - ms / ms . 
 subsequently  the final minimum consensus protein lists from the three data sets were compared to evaluate the ability of enhancing sensitivity of repetitive analysis and additional fractionation strategies . 
 microsol ief initially was developed to prefractionate complex proteomes prior to narrow ph range 2-d gels(33 ) and was subsequently used prior to 1-d sds - page as part of a 4-d strategy for fractionating serum or plasma.(11 ) in this study  we evaluated its utility for prefractionating cell lysates prior to gelc - ms / ms  since this separation mode is orthogonal to sds - page and does not suffer from many of the limitations of 2-d gels . 
 because the dynamic range of protein concentrations in cell lysates is substantially less than in plasma or serum  the microsol ief separation was designed to yield four final fractions rather than the larger number of fractions typically used for plasma . 
 the immobiline membrane disks between chambers were extracted because  as shown previously  proteins with pi values close to the ph of the disk remain in the disk but can be recovered in high yield . 
 extracts from disks with extreme ph values ( 3.0 and 12 ) showed only trace amount of proteins  as few proteins have pi s near these values . 
 extractions from disks located between separation chambers contained a mixture of proteins unique to that disk and proteins present in adjacent chambers as previously observed . 
 when similar samples were separated by microsol ief and analyzed on 2-d gels  comparisons of solution fractions and membrane fractions showed that most proteins recovered from membrane disks were either unique to the membrane or had pi s slightly lower than the ph of the membrane ( data not shown ) . since the goal in this experiment was to fractionate the entire proteome into a small number of fractions at the microsol ief step  disk extracts were combined with the fraction to its right to maximize recovery ( figure 2 ) . 
 the extraction from the ph 12 disk was discarded as it contained a negligible amount of protein . 
 thus  after microsol ief fractionation  the cancer cell proteome was divided into four fractions of roughly similar complexity and with a simpler protein content . 
 separation of the melanoma 1205lu cell extract by microsol ief and pooling to produce four fractions . 
 equal portions of each fraction and separation membrane disk extract were analyzed by sds - page to evaluate separation and relative amounts of total protein in each fraction . 
 the solution recovered from individual chambers was pooled with the adjacent membrane disk extract on the low ph side of the pool  as shown at the bottom of the gel  to produce four fractions . 
 the extract from the ph 12 membrane disk had negligible protein and was not used further . for the conventional gelc - ms / ms method  
 60 g of the original cell lysate  which was close to a maximum load while avoiding band distortion  was loaded into each of two lanes of a nupage gel ( figure 3a ) . 
 proteins were separated until the tracking dye migrated 40 mm . after staining the gel with colloidal coomassie  the 40-mm lane was divided into 20 equal fractions and digested with trypsin 
 . digests from corresponding positions in the two replicate lanes were combined to yield sufficient volume for four 8 l injections . 
 sds - page separation of melanoma 1205lu cell lysate and microsol fractions for proteome analysis . 
 samples were electrophoresed until the tracking dye migrated 4 cm ; gels were stained with colloidal coomassie and individual lanes were cut into 20 equal - sized slices  as shown . 
 ( a ) for the 2-d method  the unfractionated lysate of the 1205lu cells was separated in two lanes ( 60 g / lane ) . 
 ( b ) microsol ief fractions derived from 120 g of cell lysate were separated for the 3-d method . 
 for the 3-d method  the amount of each fraction loaded onto the preparative gel was the protein recovered from 120 g of total cell lysate ( figure 3b ) . 
 hence  the total amount of protein in the four gel lanes in figure 3b should be close to the amount of protein in the two lanes in figure 3a  provided sample losses during the microsol ief procedure were low  as has been previously demonstrated . 
 as noted above  the gel lanes from the microsol fractions were cut and digested in the same manner as the gel slices from figure 3a  except in this case there were no duplicate gel lanes to be combined . 
 hplc and mass spectrometer performance were carefully monitored to ensure consistent performance through these experiments . 
 to further minimize effects of minor instrument performance variations  samples were injected in an order described in materials and methods . 
 consistent performance of the autoinjector was monitored by weighing each sample vial before and after injection . 
 there was no significant difference in the injection amount between the two methods ( t - test p > 0.05 ) . 
 all data were consistently analyzed and filtered as described in materials and methods  which resulted in estimated false - positive rates ( fpr ) calculated by dividing reverse - hit peptide counts by forward - hit peptide counts of 1.6% and 1.4% for 2-d and 3-d data  respectively . 
 figure 4 shows the nonredundant peptide and protein counts for the 3-d data set as well as differing numbers of replicates for the 2-d sample set . 
 similar numbers of peptide and protein identifications were obtained for all individual 2-d data sets ( data not shown ) . as expected  
 the total number of nonredundant peptides increased moderately as additional replicate data sets were combined  and the incremental increase diminished as each new replicate was added . 
 it was evident from the curve shown in figure 4a that the data set resulting from combining four replicate runs was approaching a plateau . 
 parallel trends were observed for the peptide data sets defined by proteins identified by 3  2  or 1 peptide(s ) . 
 a total of 25  641 nonredundant peptides were identified after combining all four replicates of the 2-d analysis  which was 26% less than the 32  216 peptides identified by the 3-d method . 
 ( a ) nonredundant peptide counts from a single 2-d analysis  combined data from increasing numbers of replicate analyses  and the 3-d method . 
 ( b ) corresponding nonredundant protein counts for the same data sets as shown in panel a. the total number of lc - ms / ms runs that each data set contains is shown at the bottom of the figure . 
 protein counts showed a similar trend as the peptide counts ( figure 4b )  that is  adding a second replicate increased the number of nonredundant proteins more markedly than adding a third and fourth replicate . 
 for example  the number of proteins identified by two or more peptides increased by 594  305  and 162 when two  three  and four replicates were combined . the most appropriate comparison of the 3-d and 2-d methods is between the 3-d data set and four replicates of the 2-d samples because they both involve a total of 80 lc - ms / ms runs using equal amounts of initial cell lysate . 
 when protein identifications based on two or more peptides were counted  the 3-d method identified 3486 proteins compared with 2850 proteins for the 2-d method . 
 these 636 additional proteins ( 22.3% increase ) indicate a clear advantage of the 3-d method compared with the 2-d / replicate run method  even when equal amounts of mass spectrometer time are utilized . 
 the proteomes produced by the 2-d / four repetitive - run and the 3-d methods were compared using the lists of proteins identified by two or more peptides . 
 this comparison was facilitated by the fact that both data sets were searched using the same database and that dtaselect lists all protein names identified in the search . 
 if a protein identification carried one protein name that could be found in the other data set  we deduced that both data sets had identified the same protein . 
 this comparison at the protein name level showed extensive overlap between the two data sets even at this first level comparison ( figure 5 ) . 
 specifically  the two data sets shared 2555 proteins  which corresponded to 90% of the smaller 2-d / repetitive - run proteome . 
 the 295 proteins that appeared to be unique to the less in - depth 2-d / replicate run data set were further investigated to determine the basis for this apparent lack of reproducibility between in - depth analyses of the same biological sample . 
 further analysis showed that 184 of these proteins were present in the 3-d data set as single - hit proteins . 
 a majority ( 135 ) of these 184 proteins were two - peptide proteins in the 2-d data  indicating that the 3-d method identified these proteins by one less peptide . 
 when the unfiltered data for the 3-d proteome was examined using randomly selected proteins in this group  we found that a substantial number of these proteins had been identified by the same second peptide as in the 2-d data set  but one or more of the filtering parameters was slightly lower than the cutoff values selected for global data filtering . as a result 
  these moderate changes in scoring parameters reduced the two- or three - hit protein identification in the 2-d data set to a 1-hit protein in the 3-d data set . 
 we also further evaluated the 111 proteins found exclusively in the 2-d method . more than three - quarters ( 88 ) of them were two - peptide proteins . among these identifications  
 the 11 proteins identified by more than three unique peptide sequences were a particular concern  as the number of peptide identifications suggested that these proteins were not near the detection threshold and should have been identified in the more in - depth 3-d proteome . 
 we found that the majority of the peptide sequences associated with these 11 proteins in the 2-d data set also existed in the 3-d data set  but they were assigned to highly homologous proteins ( supplemental table 1 ) . although a large number of common sequences for these proteins were observed in both data sets  a small number of unique sequences led the dtaselect program to assign these peptides to different proteins for each data set . 
 of the 385 peptides assigned to the 111 proteins unique to the 2-d / replicate run data set  226 peptides were present in the filtered 3-d data 
 the two methods identified 2555 common proteins with two or more peptides per protein ( 90% of the total proteins identified in the smaller 2-d / replicate - run data set ) . 
 of the 295 apparently unique proteins in the 2-d method  184 proteins were identified in the 3-d data set by one peptide . 
 the pie charts in the lower panels show the number of peptide hits for the 2-d method for the proteins that were not directly identified in the 3-d data set ( 111 proteins or 3.9% of the proteins in the 2-d data set ) and those identified by a single peptide in the 3-d data set ( 183 proteins or 6.5% of the proteins in the 2-d data set ) . 
 these proteins  which were identified by two or three peptides in the 2-d / replicate data set  were identified by a single peptide in the 3-d data set . in each case  a second peptide was detected in the 3-d data set but failed to pass the data filter cutoff due to slightly lower values for xcorr or cn ( bolded values in table ) . 
 the filtering cutoff values used were xcorr  1.8 ( + 1 ) ; 2.1 ( + 2 ) ; 3.25 ( + 3 )  cn  0.05 . the bold values indicate they are below cutoff value .  -  indicates  not found . 
 to a first approximation  those proteins identified in the 2-d / repetitive - runs data set by only two or three peptides can be regarded as likely low - abundance proteins in the sample analyzed  since sequence coverage is usually a rough indicator of protein abundance level . 
 the relative depth of coverage for these putative low - abundance proteins was compared in the 2-d / repetitive - run and the 3-d methods . as shown in figure 6  
 for those proteins identified in both data sets  the majority showed greater sequence coverage in the 3-d data set . 
 that is  of the 491 common proteins identified by two peptides in the 2-d data  the 3-d method found more peptides for 317 proteins ( 64.6% ) and the remaining proteins in this group were identified with an equal number of peptides . furthermore  in 114 cases  the 3-d method found at least three additional unique peptides  indicating a substantially greater depth of analysis . 
 of the 394 common proteins identified by the 2-d method with three peptides  325 proteins ( 82.5% ) were identified by an equal or larger number of peptides in the 3-d method . 
 these data clearly indicate that  in most cases  the 3-d method had the ability to detect more peptides for low - abundance proteins than did the 2-d method . 
 comparison of the number of peptides identified in the 2-d / repetitive and 3-d methods . 
 ( a ) among proteins common to both data sets  491 proteins were identified by two peptides in the 2-d / repetitive data set . 
 the 3-d method found an equal number of peptides for 174 proteins and more peptides for 317 proteins . 
 ( b ) among 394 proteins identified with three peptides by the 2-d method  the 3-d method found one less peptide for 69 proteins ( i.e.  + 1 for 2-d )  an equal number of peptides for 99 proteins  and more peptides for 226 proteins . 
 in this study  we systematically evaluated the relative merits of repetitive lc - ms / ms runs compared with introduction of an additional protein level separation step for increasing proteome coverage of cancer cell lysates . 
 factors that affect apparent reproducibility between proteome analyses performed on the same sample also were evaluated . the basic analysis platform used for repetitive analyses 
 was the commonly utilized gelc - ms / ms method  which can be considered to be a 2-d proteomics method as it involves two dimensions of separation  that is  protein separation using sds - page and reverse - phase hplc separation of tryptic peptides . 
 this method was compared to a 3-d method consisting of solution ief at the protein level followed by the gelc - ms / ms method . 
 it is important when comparing alternative analysis platforms to consider the total number of lc - ms / ms runs per proteome  because improved proteome coverage typically can be achieved by lengthening the hplc gradient or by repeating lc - ms / ms analysis of complex samples . 
 similarly  many separation modes prior to lc - ms / ms can be at least incrementally improved by simply increasing the number of fractions collected  provided that the resolution of the separation method exceeds the initial fraction size used . 
 but in some cases  increases in protein coverage may be too small to be considered advantageous when total analysis time per proteome is considered . 
 hence  evaluation of the merits of greater depth of analysis  particularly small improvements  must be constantly weighted relative to overall throughput . 
 furthermore  total mass spectrometer instrument time frequently is the limiting resource  and when fractionation prior to the lc - ms / ms step is used  it is the rate - limiting step in proteome analysis throughput . hence  the most meaningful comparisons are those where the total mass spectrometer analysis time per proteome is held constant . in this study  we used a consistent gradient time and 80 lc - ms / ms runs for both the 3-d method and the 2-d / repetitive - run method ( four repeat injections ) . 
 similarly  all other experimental variables were held as constant as possible  including use of replicate aliquots of a single cell lysate preparation  gel separation lengths  gel volumes per trypsin digestion reaction  instrument tuning  and data - analysis methods . 
 our goal was to determine  quantitatively  which method represents the more efficient utilization of mass spectrometer time when analyzing complex proteomes . 
 robust proteome analysis methods should be reproducible in addition to identifying the majority of proteins present in a biological sample 
 . one major cause of variations in proteins identified in replicate analyses of the same proteome is undersampling in the mass spectrometer  as discussed above . 
 therefore  high proteome coverage should be linked to good reproducibility of proteome analysis results because extensive proteome coverage will occur only if undersampling is minimized . a second factor that will contribute to poor reproducibility between proteome protein lists is use of data filtering conditions that result in high false - peptide and protein - identification rates  since false positives usually are random . 
 hence  data filtering stringency is another tradeoff that must be considered when selecting a proteome analysis strategy . 
 while low stringency filters contribute to noise and low reproducibility  excessively stringent filters will greatly diminish the number of protein identifications and hence the value of the experiment . in the current study 
  data filters were used that yielded peptide false - positive rates between 1 and 2% as estimated using a decoy reverse database  thereby minimizing apparent poor reproducibility between data sets . 
 this level of stringency results in very few false positives for proteins identified by two or more peptides and  while there are some false positives within the one - hit protein list  a majority of these identifications are correct . 
 the repetitive analyses of 2-d data showed increased peptide and protein counts ( figure 4 ) indicative of undersampling in the basic gelc - ms / ms method used here . 
 the overall gain from four repetitive analyses of proteins identified by two or more peptides was 1061 ( 59% ) compared to the initial single analysis . a similar increase ( 61% ) 
 was observed in repetitive mudpit using nine analyses.(10 ) as expected  the greatest positive impact on proteome coverage was use of a second replicate run  which increased the number of proteins identified by two or more peptides by 33% while doubling instrument time . 
 in contrast  adding a third and fourth replicate only increased protein coverage by 13% and 6%  respectively . 
 these data indicate that performing a second analysis of each fraction when using gelc - ms / ms would be a positive tradeoff between instrument time and protein coverage . 
 however  further doubling of instrument time by performing four repetitive runs is unlikely to represent optimal use of instrument time for most types of experiments . of course 
  an alternative to performing a repetitive analysis of gel fractions would be to obtain more slices per gel lane . 
 in analogous experiments where gel lanes were divided into 40 or 60 fractions  we observed increases in the number of proteins identified that were similar to those obtained in this study for duplicate and triplicate analyses of the 20 fractions per gel lane ( data not shown ) . 
 although producing more fractions per gel lane increases the number of in - gel digestions  the overall increase in total analysis time for a proteome is minor . 
 hence  we generally prefer to use more fractions per lane rather than to replicate analyses when greater depth of analysis is desired using gelc - ms / ms experiments . 
 longer gels and larger numbers of fractions per lane were not used in the current study because we wanted to keep total mass spectrometer time per proteome ( approximately 160 h per proteome ) within practical limits while simultaneously matching gel lengths  gel volumes  and other parameters . that is  extrapolating from other 2-d and 3-d experiments that we have performed  we expect that the total number of proteins for each data set ( 2-d  2-d / repetitive runs  and 3-d ) 
 would have increased moderately if we would have used 40 or 60 slices per gel lane for all samples . but 
 use of 40 or 60 fractions per gel lane would have increased total instrument time to about 320 and 480 h per proteome  which represents an impractically low throughput for most studies . 
 interestingly  as we increase the number of fractions per gel lane to 40 or 60 fractions  the incremental increases in new proteins identified diminish  analogous to the diminishing benefits of adding each additional replicate in the repetitive - run approach ( figure 4a ) . 
 although similar trends are observed for these two approaches  the mechanisms for increasing protein coverage are quite different . that is  using a larger number of gel fractions increases protein separation and simplifies the mixture of proteins present in each fraction  while repetitive runs exploit subtle variations in peptide separations in replicate hplc runs and subtle variations in data - dependent selection of low - level ions for ms / ms fragmentation and analysis . 
 the 3-d method clearly provided superior protein and peptide coverage compared with the 2-d / repetitive method  which indicates that adding an additional protein separation step represents a more efficient use of mass spectrometer instrument time . 
 this method identified 3486 proteins with two or more peptides  which is 22% more than the 2-d / repetitive method that used equal instrument time . at the peptide level 
  the 3-d method identified 30  385 high - confidence  nonredundant peptides  which is nearly 2.5 times more than that found in a single survey using the 2-d method ( 12  160 ) and 28% more than the cumulative count in four repetitive analyses ( 23  648 ) . 
 furthermore  more unique peptides were found for most low - abundance proteins in the 3-d method data compared with the cumulative 2-d method data ( figure 6 ) . 
 it is not surprising that adding solution ief as an additional orthogonal protein separation step to a gelc - ms / ms method is an efficient strategy for increasing proteome coverage and sequence coverage of lower - abundance proteins . 
 microsol ief separates the proteins that would normally be in a single gel slice into four gel slices ( see figure 3 ) . 
  the simpler samples should decrease ion suppression effects and reduce dynamic range within each digest . finally  in some cases  improved scores for ms2 spectra in the 3-d method probably resulted from a lower probability of interfering ions being isolated with the target ion for fragmentation . 
 while the repetitive analysis strategy also improved proteome coverage  it had neither a built - in mechanism to reduce repeated sampling of abundant ions between replicates  nor could it explore the ions below the ms2 triggering threshold . 
 an alterative technique that has sometimes been used to improve replicate runs is to scan different mass ranges in each replicate . 
 however  pilot experiments suggested that this approach was less productive than the simple repetitive analysis method used here 
 . one frequent criticism of proteomics methods is that the proteins identified on repeat analyses often are not very reproducible . 
 a recent study suggested good reproducibility was achievable across 27 laboratories on a simple 20-protein mixture after uniform data processing was used.(35 ) but this simple sample of abundant proteins at the same concentration does not reflect real biological complexity . 
 hence  in the current study  we compared the reproducibility between different analysis methods using a very complex sample of biological interest  that is  a human cancer cell lysate . among four replicate analyses of the 2-d samples  
 this indicated at least 76% of the proteins observed in one analysis were reproducibly detected despite significant undersampling . 
 more importantly  at least 90% of the proteins observed in the 2-d / four - replicate data set based on two or more peptides directly matched to a corresponding protein 3-d data set  and most of the apparent mismatches were caused by trivial data analysis issues . 
 a more rigorous comparison of the two comprehensive data sets showed that greater than 96% of the proteins identified in the 2-d / repetitive - run proteome were actually observed within the complete 3-d data set . 
 one reason for the initially apparent  lower reproducibility when protein names were compared was slight variations in peptides scores together with use of rigid data filter cutoff values ( see above and figure 5 ) . 
 that is  the 10% of proteins that were apparently unique to the 2-d / repetitive - run data set included 184 proteins ( 6.4% of the 2-d / repetitive protein list ) that were identified by a single peptide in the 3-d data set . reasons why these proteins were only identified by a single peptide in the 3-d data set include run - to - run variations in automated selection of low - abundance signals for ms / ms and run - to - run variations in sequest scores coupled with use of rigid data filters . 
 a second contributing factor to the initially apparent  lower reproducibility at the protein list level is database redundancy and limitations of current software for consistently producing consensus protein lists from identified peptides . of the 111 proteins apparently unique to the 2-d 
 / repetitive - run data set and not identified by a single - hit protein in the 3-d data set  most were highly homologous to proteins identified in the 3-d data set ( see results and supplemental table 1 ) . among the 385 peptides belonging to the 111 unique proteins in the 2-d data  
 although these 111 unique proteins comprised 4% of all proteins identified  the 159 unique peptides were only 0.7% of all 2-d filtered peptides . 
 this illustrates that very small variations in identified peptides can have a proportionally higher  apparent 
 since we used each unique peptide a single time during assembly of consensus protein lists  the common sequences were assigned to the protein with the most unique sequences . 
 consequently  for a group of proteins that have high sequence identity  one or two unique peptides could determine which protein in the protein family emerged in the final consensus protein list . 
 this illustrates that better software tools are needed for identifying and displaying putative unique proteins within protein families . 
 similarly  improved databases with uniform names or other labels that clearly indicate membership within a protein family would be beneficial . in conclusion  
 additional prefractionation with microsol ief substantially increased proteome coverage and sequence coverage compared with a gelc - ms / ms - repetitive run method that utilized an equal amount of mass spectrometer time . 
 furthermore  the reproducibility of protein lists between the two methods was quite high because undersampling during data acquisition had been minimized . 
 most of the apparent differences in protein identifications were due to limitations of current sequence databases and protein naming conventions  as well as software limitations for filtering database search results and building consensus protein lists .","!

Abstract: We compared a 2-D method with a 3-D method using cancer cell lysates to increase coverage of complex proteomes. The 3-D method detected substantially more unique peptides and proteins, indicating the effectiveness of multidimensional fractionation. Furthermore, high reproducibility was achieved with multidimensional methods.

Research and Discussion: The complexity of tryptic digests often exceeds mass spectrometer capacity, resulting in undersampling of data. To combat this, we compared a 1-D gelc-MS/MS method with a 3-D method using solution isoelectric focusing. The 3-D method outperformed the 1-D method in detecting unique peptides and proteins, particularly from low-abundance proteins. This highlights the importance of additional fractionation at the protein level for depth of analysis.

Results and Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that multidimensional separation methods, such as the 3-D method, are more effective at achieving high coverage of complex proteomes. Over 90% of the protein identifications from the 1-D method were also found in the 3-D method data, indicating high reproducibility. These findings have implications for analyzing human cancer cell lysates and other complex proteomes, where reproducibility is critical for obtaining reliable results. "
"there is increasing evidence of a clear genetic link between the phenotypic characteristics of dogs and adverse drug reactions . 
 the fields of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics have become increasingly promising regarding the clinical application of genetic data to aid in prevention of adverse reactions  prediction of the behaviour of drugs and discovery of new drug targets for study . 
 the introduction of a new parasiticide in the 1980s revealed a pre - existing mutation in dogs that predisposes the animals to potentially fatal neurotoxicosis . 
 the drug  ivermectin  exerts its antiparasitic action by potentiating ligand - gated chloride ion channels in the peripheral nervous system of several invertebrate phyla . 
 the mdr1 - 1 mutation in the multidrug resistance gene ( mdr-1 ) causes ivermectin intoxication in carriers . 
 this mutation results in altered expression of p - glycoprotein and altered behaviour of the drug in collies and other related dog breeds . 
 the mdr-1 and cyp2d15 genes have been studied in the uruguayan cimarron dog breed ; however  no mutations were identified in the 36 uruguayan cimarron animals analysed in these studies . 
 several recent pharmacogenetic findings have been shown to be clinically relevant for patients of veterinary clinics  and the dog population is one of the most suitable models for examination of population genetics . 
 clinically  collies and other related dog breeds have been observed to be more susceptible to the effects of ivermectin on the central nervous system ( cns ) . 
 the clinical signs of these effects include tremors  salivation  coma  depression and ataxia . 
 moreover  very small doses ( 1/100 - 1/200 standard ) cause acute and severe reactions in some  but not all collie breeds . 
 approximately 75% of collies in the united states  france and australia have a mutant allele for the expression of modified p - glycoprotein . 
 furthermore  the affected breeds have a similar lineage that includes other sheepdog breeds  such as old english sheepdogs  australian shepherds  shelties  english shepherds  border collies  german shepherds  longhaired whippets and silken windhounds 
 . breeds that suffer from a deletion of the mdr-1 gene are more likely to experience adverse reactions in response to low doses of the drug . 
 the cyp2b6 enzyme system ( cyp2b6 is a member of the cytochrome p450 group of enzymes ) is encoded by the cyp2b6 gene in humans and cyp2b11 in dogs . 
 this class of enzymes is responsible for the metabolism of a wide variety of drugs . 
 while the risk of drug - drug interactions involving human cyp2b enzymes appears to be low due to minimal involvement in drug oxidation and low hepatic expression  canine cyp2b11 has exhibited surprisingly high levels of activity in vitro toward drugs that are used in dogs  such as benzodiazepines . 
 the cyp1a2 enzyme is a member of cytochrome p450 that is encoded by the cyp1a2 gene . 
 cytochrome p450 ( cyp ) is a superfamily of enzymes that plays an important role in the oxidative metabolism of a wide variety of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds . 
 additionally  this gene is constitutively expressed in human and dog livers and involved in the metabolism of many drugs  including caffeine  phenacetin  teophylline and tracing drugs . 
 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) have been identified as deficiencies in the canine cyp1a2 gene . 
 these deficiencies have been shown to significantly alter the pharmacokinetic behaviour of two drugs and associated with large inter - individual differences in the kinetic behaviour of a third drug . 
 the resulting deficiency of cyp1a2 has been found to cause significant kinetic variations in ac3933  ym-64277  and a few other drugs in beagles . 
 however  the significance of the effects of genetic polymorphisms of other canine cyps have not yet been fully explored . 
 in contrast  snp genetic markers are considered to be the most recent generation of molecular markers . 
 any of the four nucleotides may be present at any position in the genome ; therefore  it must be assumed that each snp has four alleles . 
 this is theoretically possible  but in practice  the majority of snp variants have only two alleles  the original sequence and a single mutated version . this is because of the way in which they appear and are distributed in a population . 
 this study was conducted to gain further insight into the characteristics of a breed or population and identify the snp genetic polymorphisms associated with the three genes ( mdr-1  cyp1a2 and cyp2b11 ) involved in the metabolism of drugs used for medical treatments in several animals belonging to four different canine breeds . as several authors have noted  
 further studies are required to understand the regulatory effects of the polymorphisms and their potential clinical relevance . 
 the rationale was to identify genetic polymorphisms in the genes that encode proteins and enzymes involved in drug transport  metabolism and action that can predict the usefulness of a particular drug to increase the numbers of responders and decrease the numbers of subjects affected by adverse drug reactions . 
 the future of pharmacogenetics and its veterinary applications will have lasting effects on clinical decisions made in the future . 
 the goal of drug therapy is to maximise the therapeutic effects while minimising the adverse effects associated with drugs and drug interactions . 
 a total of 106 different animals belonging to four different canine breeds were studied ; 25 uruguayan cimarrons  23 border collies  29 labrador retrievers and 29 german shepherds . for analysis  
 blood was extracted under aseptic conditions from dogs while they were with their owners in their houses . 
 dna was extracted from the blood samples using a dneasy tissue kit ( qiagen  the netherlands ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions  after which the dna quality and purity were evaluated using a nanodrop nd1000 spectrophotometer . 
 twenty - six snps belonging to three different genes  mdr-1 ( 5 snp )  cyp1a2 ( 20 snp ) and cyp2b11 ( one snp )  were investigated according to the results obtained by several authors  with reference to the snp cluster report of the dbsnp ( ncbi ) genbank ( fig . 
 1 and table 1 ) . samples were sent out to geneseek ( neogen  usa ) for snp testing . 
 a total of 5512 sequences were analysed in the 26 loci ( two sequences for each locus in the 106 animals ) . 
 the resulting sequences were then analysed using the blast programme   to search for the most similar sequences in genbank ( national center for biotechnology information  usa ) . 
 snp polymorphisms were analysed using genetix  arlequin  multivariate descriptive statistical analyses ( correspondence analyses )   and the snpstat programmes . 
 this analysis allows investigation of a qualitative variable ( breed ) in terms of other qualitative variables ( alleles ) and the classical term of inertia can be assimilated into diversity . 
 this method is conceptually similar to principal component analysis  but applies to categorical rather than continuous data . in a manner similar to principal component analysis 
  this method provides a means of displaying or summarising a set of data in three - dimensional graphical form . 
 the analysis is conducted from a contingency table according to breed in which the rows are composed of the dependent variable ( breed ) and the columns are the set of explanatory variables ( alleles ) . 
 the results allow acquisition of the relative importance ( inertias ) of both breeds and alleles . 
 a graphical representation is created through a system of points in euclidean space  and the degree of their robustness is verified . 
 the snpstat programme   has been designed to conduct genetic association studies using snps and to analyse moderate numbers of snps ( 26 dnps in this paper ) . 
 this programme provides allele and genotype frequencies  a test for hardy - weinberg equilibrium  analysis of the association with a response variable based on linear or logistic regression  analysis of interactions  linkage disequilibrium statistics  haplotype frequency estimation  analysis of the associations of haplotypes with the response and analysis of interactions ( haplotypes - covariate ) . 
 the cumulative frequency is also known to facilitate selection of the threshold cut - off point with which rare haplotypes are grouped for further analysis . 
 the association analyses of haplotypes are similar to those of genotypes in that logistic regression results are shown as either ors and 95% cis or as linear regression results with differences in means and 95% cis . 
 the most frequent haplotype is automatically selected as the reference category and rare haplotypes are pooled together in a group . 
 the 26 snps examined in the 106 animals exhibited different frequencies in each breed ( table 2 ) . 
 an exact test for hardy - weinberg equilibrium was performed  and it was confirmed in the uruguayan cimarron population . indeed  this population was in equilibrium for all loci ( snp12  snp14  snp15  snp16 and snp18 0.05 < p < 0.10 ) and was therefore used as the control population . as shown in table 2  snp1  snp2  snp3  snp4 and snp 5 exhibited allelic fixation in the uruguayan cimarron and labrador retriever breeds . 
 all of the obtained fis values were negative  indicating a lack of inbreeding in the examined animals . 
 2 . the cimarron population ( population 1 ) exhibited a greater genetic distance with respect to the border collie ( population 2 )  labrador retriever ( population 3 ) and german shepherd ( population 4 ) breeds . 
 correspondence analysis indicated that the border collie breed exhibited 60% inertia  which was the greatest inertia observed in all four breeds  while the uruguayan cimarron breed exhibited the least ( 8% ) . the first axis  which explained 65.68% of the total inertia  clearly differentiated the cimarron breed from the other breeds . 
 axis 2 explained only 10.42% of the total inertia  and the third axis  which explained 23.90%  did not clearly discriminate any of the breeds . 
 the uruguayan cimarron breed exhibited the greatest genetic difference with respect to the other studied breeds . 
 the haplotypes for all individuals were analysed using the snpstat programme  which enabled estimation of the haplotype frequencies . 
 although the number of potential combinations of haplotypes can be very high ( 2 )  the most frequent haplotypes ( those with frequencies greater than 1% ) included 12 in the cimarron population  19 in the border collie population  22 in the labrador retriever population and 18 in the german shepherd population . 
 these haplotypes were compared to those of the control population  while those that exhibited frequencies below 1% are included in the rare haplotypes section . 
 the programme selected the most frequent haplotype as the reference  while rare haplotypes were pooled together into a group . in each breed  
 34% of the individuals exhibited haplotype number 1  while 21% exhibited haplotype number 2 and the remaining haplotypes had frequencies below 10% . 
 border collies exhibited haplotype number 1 at 32%  while the remaining haplotypes occurred at frequencies below 10% . 
 the labrador retriever breed exhibited haplotype number 1 at 36%  while the german shepherd breed exhibited haplotype 1 at 16% and haplotype number 2 at 13% . the remaining haplotypes exhibited frequencies below 10% . 
 analysis of the associations of each snp were performed for the binary response variable  and logistic regression analysis provided a summary of the genotype frequencies  proportions  odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals . 
 we used the null hypothesis of similar effects in all studied dog breeds to determine if significant differences existed among breeds . 
 an example of locus snp22 is shown in table 5  in which the snp marker exhibited a significant difference from the control population ( p < 0.0001 ) . in this case  
 an association with the effects on the cyp1a2 gene was shown . according to the obtained results  the following 10 of the 26 snps exhibited significant differences and 
 were associated with drug sensitivity : snp6  snp12  snp15  snp16  snp20  snp21  snp22  snp24 and snp25 of the cyp1a2 gene  and snp26 of the cyp2b11 gene . 
 all of these snps are potential candidates for studies of drug sensitivity in these breeds . 
 the results obtained in this study revealed that three breeds ( border collie  labrador retrievers and german shepherd ) exhibited several candidate alleles useful for investigation of genes that control drug sensitivity . 
 the correspondence analysis indicated that the border collie breed exhibited greater genetic variability and reduced inbreeding characteristics ( -0.52382 fis ; fis values range from -1 to + 1 ) . 
 in contrast  the uruguayan cimarron breed exhibited less genetic variability and fewer inbreeding characteristics ( -0.27243 fis value ) and was also free of inbreeding problems . 
 snps have been used as markers for diagnoses of specific features that are abundant in the genome  genetically stable and easily analysed . 
 the underlying principle is based on identifying associations between a gene or genes that affect a variable ( e.g.  drug resistance ) and the snp markers . 
 if the application of a statistical programme ( i.e.  snpstat in the present study ) reveals significant differences between genotypic classes  it can be concluded that there is an association between that marker and the studied characteristic . 
 our results indicated that the border collie  labrador retriever and german shepherd breeds exhibited significant differences from the uruguayan cimarron breed in 10 snps of the cyp1a2 and cyp2b11 genes . 
 different studies have examined the frequencies of several single nucleotide substitutions of canine genes that are associated with product resistance and drug sensitivity to survey other purebred populations that might be genetically at risk . 
 our results are concordant with those obtained by other authors who have examined other canine breeds . 
 the cyp1a2 gene of the beagle breed has been examined using the csnp method   and a non - functional allele that indicated that interindividual differences in the pharmacokinetics of cyp1a2 substrates should be examined in this breed was discovered . 
 additionally  one snp identified in cyp1a2 causes a protein deletion and deficiencies in toxicological evaluations . 
 most common diseases involve complex genetic traits  and multiple genetic and environmental components contribute to susceptibility . 
 it has been proposed that common genetic variants  including single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps )  influence the susceptibilities to common disease . 
 this proposal has begun to be tested in numerous studies of the associations between the genetic variations in these common dna polymorphisms and the variations in disease susceptibilities . 
 our preliminary results indicate that several polymorphisms were present in the studied genes and that these polymorphic loci are potential candidates for investigations of drug resistance . the analysis of these genetic marker snp candidates might be very useful before subjecting animals to drugs and other medical treatments because they are easily identified  and the methodology is simple and inexpensive . 
 the results presented herein will contribute to efficient and reliable studies of drug candidates in dogs . 
 this technology can detect animals that might be at risk and verify their genotypic characteristics to personalise drug therapy at the individual level rather than the population level . with advances that provide clear genetic responses 
  we can identify new drug targets and more precisely apply drug therapy to minimise adverse effects and maximise therapeutic benefits . 
 academic and clinical research efforts in pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics might be beneficial to the entirety of veterinary medicine in the coming years .","

1) Abstract: This study examined the potential use of genetic screening in preventing adverse drug reactions in four canine breeds. The mdr-1, cyp1a2, and cyp2b11 genes were investigated for SNPs associated with drug sensitivity. 

2) Research and Discussion: The multidrug resistance gene (mdr-1) has been extensively studied in dogs, but other genes such as cyp1a2 and cyp2b11 also play a role in drug metabolism. This study identified potential SNP targets for further drug sensitivity investigations in four canine breeds. 

3) Results and Conclusion: SNPs in the cyp1a2 and cyp2b11 genes were found to be potential targets for further drug sensitivity investigations in the examined canine breeds. The promising applications of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in preventing adverse drug reactions in animals warrants further research and development in this field. "
"the emergency department ( ed ) is known to be one of the most congested units in any hospital that faces greater pressure in terms of patient load and health care resources as compared to other departments of the health care system . 
 studies across various countries reported that quality of care decreases when the ed is overcrowded . 
 overcrowding can result in delayed treatment  long patient waiting time and stay  overburdened working staff  patient elopement  high medical error rate  low productivity and poor patient outcomes . 
 an efficient patient flow system serves critical patient quickly minimizing unnecessary delay in treatment . on the other hand  
 a patient arriving in the ed encounters repeated waits as he / she progresses in different stages  which may last for hours or even days . waiting time has been often cited as the most important cause of patients dissatisfaction in the ed . 
 cooke cited reduction of  waits  as the most important area for improvement in ed . 
 delays in the process have been associated with adverse outcome and increased violence in eds . waiting time in turn depends on multiple factors including volume of patients and workload on existing staff . if the outflow of patients from ed ( either by means of transfer out or by discharge ) is obstructed  this upstream bottleneck will also cause delays in the treatment . 
 the present study was conducted to assess the patient flow system by assessing the arrival time pattern and waiting time distribution of patient in the ed of a tertiary health care institute of india . by understanding flow trends 
  hospital administrators can streamline processes to minimize wait times  improve efficiency  reduce overcrowding in the emergency out patient department ( eopd ) and in turn improve patients satisfaction . 
 it was a short term cross sectional descriptive study conducted in may  2011 in ed of a tertiary level medical  research and health care institution of north india . 
 the institute caters to medical care needs of around 370 million populations of 7 states of india . in 2010 - 11  the institute catered to a yearly load of around 1657200 out - patients and 64969 inpatients  whereas the ed of the institute attended to 52894 out - patients and 32563 inpatients . 
 a data collection tool to gather the required information was developed and pilot tested . during the study period  
 the investigator was stationed in the ed from 8.00 to 18.00 h. the data regarding waiting time ( the length of time  when patient is waiting idle in the ed for delivery of the service  he requires ) and inter - arrival gap ( time gap between arrivals of two consecutive patients in the ed ) distribution was collected . 
 however  the data regarding arrival time ( the time that the patient is first recognized  as requesting service in the ed ) was obtained from the emergency records . 
 the investigator approached patients / attendants presented in the eopd during the data collection hours and asked them about their background characteristics and time of entry in the eopd . 
 they were further asked to document the waiting period for a service by asking a question  for what service the patient is waiting for and from how much time ?  the consent for undertaking the study was obtained from in - charge  ed of the institute . 
 the ed block of the institute had a treatment area of approximately 23088 square feet  which included 2 halls for patients with medical emergencies known as emergency medical opd and one hall for patients with surgical emergencies known as emergency surgical opd . 
 the ed has one main entrance for patients and two more inlets from within the hospital  one from the main hospital and one from advance trauma center . 
 there is a cabin for enquiry adjoining main entrance where two receptionists along with one assistant public relation officer respond to the queries of the patients 24  7  along with other assigned works . 
 there is a registration counter manned by one medical record technician  who register the patients  issued the gate passes to the patients attendants and mark  no payment stamp  on the recommendation form of patients after checking their eligibility . 
 a fee clerk receives the hospital charges in a cabin adjoining to the registration counter . 
 the fee counter runs from 8.00 to 20.00  after which that the collection of fees is done on the registration counter . 
 there is a radiology room ; attendant 's waiting hall  laboratories  chemist shop  blood bank  toilets ( male and female ) and senior medical officers ( smo 's ) room [ figure 1 ] . ground floor plan of emergency block of study institute in north india . 
 a : hall a emergency medical out patient department ( emopd ) ; b : hall b emopd ; c : emergency surgical out patient department ; d : waiting hall ; e : chemist shop ; f : laboratory ; g : ultrasonography room ; h : x - ray room ; i : reception ; j : corridors ; k : waiting area for patients the overall signage system was not adequate to guide the patients and their relatives . 
 there was no designated parking space for the vehicles of patients or staff who came to ed . 
 a deputy medical superintendent assisted by five smo look after the ed services . at present  
 four posts of smo were lying vacant and only one smo ( ad - hoc ) was in a position . 
 the administration of the emergency complex was looked after by the smo  such as dealing with medico - legal cases  providing poor free services to deserving patients and supply life - saving medicines and consumable items to the poor patients and supervise patient management in case of a disaster . in the eopd  
 medical staff works in 3 shifts / day viz . from 8.00 - 14.00 h  14.00 - 20.00 h and 20.00 - 8.00 h. 
 it was observed that majority ( 70% ) of the patients who visited the eopd was male and around 28% were in the age group of 45 - 59 years followed by 24.7% patients from the age group of 15 to 29 years . 
 majority ( 85% ) of the patients who arrived in eopd were in the conscious state of mind and around 64% were referred from other health care facility before coming to eopd [ table 1 ] . 
 arrival time pattern of patients showed that around 26.3% patients came during the 9.00 - 12.00 h. peak hour of the presentation was 10.01 - 11.00 with 11% of the total presentations . 
 the maximum inter - arrival gap ( 46 min ) was observed during 6.01 - 7.00 h [ figure 2 ] . 
 background characteristics of study population arrival time pattern of patients in the emergency out patient department of study institute it was observed that maximum patients ( 29.6% ) were waiting  under observation  after preliminary diagnosis by the physician and their median waiting time was 16 h. the next highest category of patients ( 16.4% ) was those who were waiting for  diagnostics tests and their results  with the median waiting time as 1 h. the number of patients  who had completed the treatment process and waiting for doctors decision regarding discharge from eopd was also substantial ( 14.6% ) with the median waiting time of 2 h. maximum median waiting time ( 38 h ) was recorded for patients waiting for their turn for operative procedure after the decision to operate . it was observed that waiting of around 71% of patients in eopd was attributed to factors within ed itself  whereas waiting of 26% patients was attributed to the reasons outside ed but within hospital [ figure 3 ] . waiting time distribution of patients for various services in the emergency out patient department of study institute ; a : waiting time attributed to reasons within the emergency department ( ed ) complex ; b : waiting time attributed to reasons outside the ed but within hospital ; c : waiting time attributed to reasons outside hospital 
 with a steep increase in life - style diseases and road traffic accidents  the demand for emergency medical health care has been increasing . however  resource constraints in terms of scarce health manpower lead to overcrowding in hospitals  which in turn compromises the quality of care . 
 most of the tertiary care hospitals of the india are facing problem with patient flow system . 
 such problem is even more apparent in ed  which are mostly overcrowded  over - utilized  inappropriately staffed and often lack coordination of care . 
 overcrowded eds and poorly managed patient flow results in excessively long waits for patients  increase in the risk of inappropriate care and poor quality of services . 
 there has been a steady rise in ed attendance in the institute over the years both in absolute terms as well as daily averages . 
 this is in conformity with an another study  conducted in a ed of a tertiary care hospital in new delhi in 2003  which concluded that during the last 3 - 4 years there had been a steady rise in the ed attendance  both in absolute terms as well as daily averages . 
 the higher use of the ed in the tertiary care hospitals can also be attributed to many reasons such as increase in the illness and chronic diseases  changes in demographic and epidemiological trends of diseases  increase in acute injuries  changes in people 's perception about emergency need for health problems  better quality of health services rendered and growing population etc . 
 this is supported by the data on accidental deaths  which had shown a rapidly increasing trend during the decade 2000 - 2010 . moreover  
 the patient 's preference toward a tertiary care institute was also documented in a study earlier done in the same institute wherein more than two - third patients were satisfied with hospital services and wish to avail them over secondary level care . 
 the provision of low cost tertiary level care treatment in study institute compared with the catastrophic cost of treatment in private hospitals might be a reason for choosing health care service in the institute . 
 lack of tertiary care hospitals of such repute in neighboring states also lead to high rush of referral cases in the institute . at present  eopd of study institute was looking after around 154 patients at a time  which was around 5 times of its original capacity . 
 to accommodate this heavy load of patients  additional patients were put on patient trolleys . as per the guidelines of australasian college of emergency medicine  
 the area of ed under study was adequate only for around 29000 yearly patient load against present 53000 . 
 due to shortage of space  even the corridors of the eopd were full with patients on trolleys with a very little space left for movement . 
 another study conducted in the same institute backs up this finding that patients were being treated in the non - treatment areas of the eopd . 
 had also concluded that frequency of medication errors in ed increased with the crowding in ed . 
 a study by goel et al . in same study institute also suggested that heavy load of patients and attendants in the non - treatment areas of eds may be a potential source of transmission of deadly infections . 
 other studies have concluded that plague infection spread rapidly through infected patient to other patients in an overcrowded emergency ward of a tertiary care institute . 
 the maximum patients in ed in our study from neurosurgery department are indicative of the fact that accidents mostly on road are increasing the volume of patients in ed . 
 chan et al . in their study concluded that total census of major patients in ed is major reason behind wait in ed . 
 the present study revealed that majority of the patients using the ed services were males . 
 these results were easy to attribute to our culture where males are more exposed to hazards due to outdoor nature of their work as opposed to females . 
 a little less than one - third of the patients who visited the ed were from the productive age group of 15 - 29 years closely followed by age group of 45 - 59 years . 
 somewhat similar using pattern were shown in an another study carried out in barbados which shows that around 36% who used the ed services were from the age group of 21 to 45 years and around 26% were above 50 years of age . 
 increase in the number of vehicles in chandigarh and its neighboring states resulting in steep upward trend in the number of road accidents might lead to increase in admission of males of the productive age group . 
 the peak arrival hours were at  9.00 - 12.00 h  in which around one fourth of the patients arrived in the eopd . 
 the finding in the present study were in consonance with another study done in a tertiary care hospital of barbados  where only 10% of daily census entered in the ed during night . 
 another study done in turkey also showed that the ed visit during the night had decreased substantially when compare to day time visits . 
 the results of another study conducted in saudi arabia are contrary to this finding in which around 46% patients attended emergency during night . 
 the reason for low arrival of patient in ed during night time in the study  can be attributed to the fact that public transport facility are shut down after 21.00 h and hefty charges are made by the private taxi operators at night . moreover  since no  on call  ambulance is provided by study institute  arranging one 's own vehicle might not be an easier option in the night . 
 moreover most of the patients arriving in ed of study institute belong to lower strata of society who prefer to wait until morning rather than taking the patient to the hospital during night time . even though there was highly random arrival patterns observed in the study  yet surprisingly  the staffing pattern was somewhat similar for all 24 h spans . 
 overloading of patient due to high arrival rate in peak hours and inappropriate staffing pattern may result in clogging of patients . 
 the guidelines adopted by american academy of emergency medicine states that 1 physician is required per 2.5 patients / hour and the nurse  patient ratio should not exceed 1:3 . 
 whereas  in the eopd of the study institute  around 10 - 11 resident doctors and 12 - 14 nurses cater to the average daily load of around 150 patients  which is much lower than the requirements . 
 the volume of patients attending an ed was observed to be a major determinant of the waiting time  if resources are fixed . 
 the resources in the department need to be matched to the workload on an hour by hour basis  despite the inherent variation in the workload . 
 our study depicts that the factors influencing the patient flow do not lie solely in ed  although waiting of at least three fourths of all the patients can be explained by the reasons lying in the ed complex itself . 
 similar to our study  schull and shanks cited unavailability of alternative levels of care in the community  delay in diagnostics and patients held in ed awaiting admission are the main causes of wait in ed . 
 derlet and richards in their study concluded that the most important cause of ed overcrowding was insufficient inpatient capacity for ed patients  who required hospital admission . 
 unavailability of inpatient beds not only delay those requiring bed but create a log jam effect  leading to unavailability of space and consequently delay of other patients who can be discharged from the ed . due to un - specified  observation area  in eopd in study area  most of the  under observation 
 chauhan et al . in their study also suggested formulating a strong admission and discharging policy in the ed to regulate the patient turn out rate . 
 fast decisions on life - and - death cases are critical in ed . as a result  doctors face great pressures to over test and over treat . 
 the fear of missing something often leads to extra blood tests and imaging scans . in the ed complex of the study institute  
 only routine diagnostic tests ( x - ray  hematology  biochemistry  ultrasonography and echocardiogram ) were performed whereas patients have to visit the concerned departments for specific tests . 
 this finding is supported by the fact that around 12.3% patients in the eopd were found waiting for specialized tests with the median waiting time of 12 h. in the eopd  the blood samples for laboratory test were taken by already overworked resident doctors . 
 another study done on the ed of study institute has also observed extreme rush in laboratories present within the premises of ed . 
 other studies have also shown similar trend wherein  unnecessary tests conducted in laboratory complex increases the rush of non - patients . 
 cooke also concluded that waiting for results of tests was one of the four commonest reasons for patient waiting in the ed . 
 a review on consultants in ed of tertiary hospitals had suggested that average response time of consultants ranges from 30 to 45 min  depending on the current needs of the patient . in our study  
 this might be due to high proportion of junior resident doctors in the ed  higher rush of patients needed super specialty consultations and lack of standard operating procedures for consultations . 
 there is ample evidence that lack of timely consultation and coordination in emergency team is a leading cause of ed overcrowding and poor case management . in our study  a small fraction ( 1% ) of patients were not aware about their reason of wait which can be possibly sketched by the fact that people feel hesitant in enquiring about the treatment from their care givers . 
 frank et al . has also concluded that insufficient information provided on waiting time  was a cause of people 's perception of waiting time being extended . 
 one of the main limitations of the study is small sample size and short duration of study . for the services availed by the patients in the absence of investigator  the investigator had to rely on the statement of the patients / attendants for time taken during the service . 
 there might be a possibility of recall bias  where patient may forget about certain type of service rendered . 
 there was a possibility of some incorrect data provided by patients or over exaggeration of waiting time . to tackle the random inflow of patients  
 it was recommended that experienced staffing in the ed should be matched with temporal arrival pattern of patients . 
 further  benchmark should be formulated for various services ( waiting time  service time ) with annual audit mechanism . 
 a laboratory technician should be posted in eopd area for blood sample collection to ease out the already overworked resident doctors . 
 the communication with patients in ed should be improved  where waiting is inevitable  health education and promotion should be introduced .

 based on the above study it can be concluded that identifying operational factors that influence patient flow in ed help hospital administration to device suitable strategy for improvements in the functioning of ed .

1) Abstract: This article presents a short cross-sectional descriptive study conducted in the emergency out patient department (EOPD) of a tertiary level health care institution in North India. The study aimed to analyze the patient flow system by assessing the arrival and waiting time distribution of patients. Data was obtained from 591 patients present in the EOPD during the month of May 2011.

2) Research and Discussion: The arrival pattern of patients in the EOPD was found to be highly stochastic, with peak hours between 9:00-12:00. The primary reasons for patient waiting included observation, routine diagnostic tests, and discharge. Most patients (71%) were waiting due to reasons within the emergency complex. This highlights the need for a multifaceted, multidisciplinary, and hospital-wide approach to address the patient flow in the emergency department.

3) Results and Conclusion: The study showed that overcrowding and inappropriate staffing of emergency departments in India lead to excessively long waits for patients. This can be attributed to the lack of a systematic approach to patient flow management. To alleviate these issues, a comprehensive and coordinated effort is required from different departments within the hospital. A patient-centered approach must be adopted to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency care services."
"primary intracystic squamous cell carcinoma ( scc ) in the breast is an extremely rare neoplasm . 
 primary sccs in the breast are quite rare  although scc mixed with ductal carcinoma is more common . 
 it can arise from metaplastic epithelium associated with other primary malignancy of the breast  metastasis from primary elsewhere in the body or an extension of malignancy from the skin covering . 
 a 45-year - old female presented with a lump in the right breast  which she had noticed since three weeks . 
 her menstrual cycles were regular and she had two children . clinical examination revealed a firm cystic lump of 12  10 cm in the upper inner and central quadrant of the right breast . 
 the skin over the right breast appeared stretched  with a slight retraction of the nipple . 
 pre - operatively  the patient was relegated to clinical stage iii ( t3n0m0 ) . 
 ultrasonographic examination of the right breast showed an irregular - shaped hypoechoic lesion measuring 12  6 cm with an internal anechoic area measuring 6  3 cm  suggesting a cystic malignant tumor . 
 fine needle aspiration from the lump in the right breast yielded 10 ml of pale yellow serous fluid . 
 wet - fixed and air - dried smears were prepared from the centrifuged aspirated fluid and were stained with papanicolaou ( pap ) stain and may - grnwald - giemsa ( mgg ) stain  respectively . 
 the smears studied were cellular and showed malignant squamous cells predominantly in singles and occasional syncytial groups  and some cells were spindle shaped . 
 the malignant squamous cells had rounded borders with hyperchromatic enlarged nucleus and coarse irregular granular chromatin . 
 cytoplasm of the squamous cells showed a variable degree of keratinisation [ figure 2 ] . 
 cytology smears showing malignant squamous cells in singles with numerous cyst macrophages ( mgg  400 ) cytology smear showing malignant squamous cells in singles  demonstrating cytoplasmic keratinisation ( pap  400 ) to exclude metastatic scc  a search for remote primary scc included chest radiograph  cystoscopy  colposcopy  oesophagogastroscopy  laryngoscopy and cervical pap smear  which did not reveal any extramammary cancer . 
 the criteria include : ( 1 ) no other neoplastic element  such as ductal or mesenchymal ones  are present in the tumor  ( 2 ) the tumor is independent of adjacent cutaneous structures and ( 3 ) no other distant epidermoid tumor exists in the patient . later  simple mastectomy with axillary clearance was performed and the specimen was sent for histological examination . 
 the cut - section of the mastectomy specimen showed a large cystic tumor measuring 8  3 cm  containing yellow serous fluid . 
 the cystic cavity was lined by dysplastic squamous epithelium with an infiltrating tumor  showing malignant squamous cells in broad sheets  groups and whorls  with keratin - pearl formation and intercellular bridges . 
 immunostaining for estrogen / progesterone receptor and her-2/neu oncoprotein were negative and that for cytokeratin was positive .

 multiple sections studied showed cystic breast tumor . the cystic cavity was lined by dysplastic squamous epithelium with an infiltrating tumor  showing malignant squamous cells in broad sheets  groups and whorls  with keratin - pearl formation and intercellular bridges . 
 immunostaining for estrogen / progesterone receptor and her-2/neu oncoprotein were negative and that for cytokeratin was positive . 
 pure scc and adenosquamous carcinoma have been listed under metaplastic breast carcinomas in the world health organization classification . 
 the japanese breast cancer society has defined  scc of the breast as a special type of cancer  in which malignant cells are arranged in broad sheets and whorls with keratin formation or intercellular bridge  . 
 the incidence of scc reported in the western countries is 0.13.6% and in japan  it is 0.17% . 
 the age group affected is between 32 and 65 years  with an increased tendency of left - sided involvement . 
 the characteristics of scc of the breast generally reported are a large - sized tumor  rapidly growing with a central cyst formed by necrosis . 
 this is unlikely in our case because there was little necrosis elsewhere in the tumor . 
 the possible mode of origin of scc is epidermoid cyst of the breast  chronic abscess and complete metaplasia of glandular breast tissue . 
 lymph node involvement is reported to be less frequent than might be expected  given the larger tumor size . 
 the tumor cells are negative for vimentin  estrogen and progesterone and are diffusely positive for high molecular weight cytokeratin and c - erbb-2 . squamous cells in fine needle aspiration cytology ( fnac ) of breast lesions can be found in various benign lesions  like epidermoid cyst  subareolar abscess  fibroadenoma  infracted papillomas  spindle cell metaplasia  cystic sarcoma phyllodes  pseudosarcoma and malignant breast tumors or metastatic malignancy 
 . the benign breast conditions with abundant squamous cells may sometimes mimic malignant squamous lesion and vice versa . in general 
 benign squamous cells are bland looking and are often associated with anucleated squames  and no tumor  cell cannibalism . 
 the malignant squamous cells are more pleomorphic  mitotically active and dyskeratotic and  sometimes  bizarre - shaped cells can be seen . 
 the differential diagnosis of malignant squamous cells in fnac of the breast includes primary scc and metastatic scc of the breast . 
 careful assessment of cytological features of squamous cells and the background appearance appears to be critical for arriving at a correct diagnosis . 
 however  in the case of intracystic scc  numerous foamy macrophages coexist with malignant squamous cells . 
 hormonal therapy is not indicated as most cases of scc are negative for hormonal receptors . 
 scc of the breast is reported to be resistant to both radiotherapy and standard chemotherapy performed for invasive ductal carcinoma . in our case  
 radical mastectomy with axillary clearance was performed with postoperative adjuvant therapy  as given for common types of breast cancers . 
 there was no evidence of recurrence of the tumor after four years of treatment . in conclusion  
 the presence of malignant squamous cells in fine needle aspiration of the breast suggests primary scc or metastatic scc . 
 the finding of a pure scc necessitates more accurate work - up to exclude skin lesion or metastasis . 
 the primary scc should not be confused with a much more largely manifested metaplastic change in other usual breast cancers . 
 although the presence of numerous cyst macrophages in the background of breast fnac smears suggests a benign lesion  when present with malignant squamous cells  they suggest intracystic scc .","

1) Abstract: Primary intracystic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the breast is a rare and low incidence entity. This article reports on a 45-year-old woman who was diagnosed with primary intracystic SCC in her right breast, confirmed through cytological and histological studies.
2) Research and Discussion: Cytological smears of the aspirated fluid from the breast tumor showed malignant squamous cells and numerous cyst macrophages, indicating cystic SCC. The presence of foamy macrophages in FNA smears suggests a benign breast lesion, but when combined with malignant squamous cells, indicates primary or metastatic SCC.
3) Results and Conclusion: A mastectomy confirmed the diagnosis of primary intracystic SCC. The abundance of foamy macrophages in the background of FNA cytology smears should not be mistaken for metaplastic changes in other breast carcinomas. This article highlights the importance of considering SCC as a possibility in patients with cystic breast lumps."
"translating empirically validated treatments into routine clinical practice is an essential activity that requires a multitude of factors to be addressed . for any given disorder  
 some of these factors include the type of patients being treated  the setting in which treatment is delivered ( including the funding arrangements and costs incurred )  the attitudes and perceptions of staff about the treatment  and the other psychological and physical disorders  diseases  and disabilities that may co - occur with the condition being treated . 
 these various factors mean that the translation will first involve a thoughtful adaptation to the given setting that takes into account local issues  current practices  staff attitudes  and funding arrangements . 
 secondly  translation will involve evaluation of the effectiveness of the resulting treatment plus an empirical consideration of factors believed to influence outcome so that treatment can be further improved [ 2  3 ] . 
 the present paper reports an attempt to translate a cognitive - behavioral program for depression to an inpatient hospital setting . 
 there is sound evidence supporting cognitive - behavioral therapy ( cbt ) in the treatment of depression  but little direction about adaptation to inpatient settings . 
 first  people with depression who require inpatient admissions often do so at a time of crisis or extreme symptom severity  and the aim is to quickly and safely return them to levels of independent function . for instance  inpatient treatment may be appropriate if there is a risk of suicide  but a goal will be to reduce symptoms rapidly  so the need for a restricted environment is removed swiftly . within these constraints  
 in addition  individuals with depression who do not require hospitalization may find an optimal treatment format to be brief  weekly sessions . 
 however  for individuals who are in a hospital  the logistics of organizing a more time - intensive program are less ( especially since the patients might otherwise not be occupied for much of the day )  and hospital staff are already present . 
 thus  an intensive day - long format of cbt becomes not only a viable option  but also a potentially good use of time . 
 third  given the constant turnover within a hospital  it is harder to mount disorder - specific treatments because the patients will possess various degrees of comorbidity and might not fit neatly into diagnostic categories  yet they may benefit from a cbt program . for reasons such as these  perth clinic developed an intensive cbt program suitable for inpatients . 
 it is a closed - group program that is open to various diagnostic groups ( but mainly depression and anxiety ) during office hours for a two - week period . 
 the first question to answer regarded the degree to which the outcomes reported in the published literature regarding group cbt for depression would generalize to this different format 
 . the second focus of the present study concerned variables related to outcome . in a hospital setting  many factors are uncontrollable . for instance  the degree and type of comorbidity is a potentially important moderator of treatment success . 
 in addition  success may be moderated by the frequency of depression ( i.e.  whether the current presentation is a single or a recurrent episode ) or the severity of the depression . according to beutler   prognosis 
 is attenuated by patient complexity / chronicity  and by an absence of patient distress . 
 facilitating social support enhances the likelihood of good outcome among patients with complex / chronic problems .  therefore  to assist with future treatment planning  it was necessary to consider the degree to which patient - related variables affected outcome . in conducting an evaluation of the current program  there were a variety of constraints imposed by the context . 
 chiefly  it was not possible to randomly assign patients to a control condition  and therefore  a variety of methods were used to evaluate the size of the treatment effect and to address some alternative explanations of a pre / posttreatment change . to increase confidence in the presumption 
 that any pre / postchanges were associated with the provision of treatment  outcomes were compared against inpatients who did not receive the cbt program and those who began the treatment but did not complete . 
 the former provide an indication of the extent of improvement without the program  but due to nonrandom assignment to conditions  it is possible that patients with poorer outcomes were not encouraged to enroll in the cbt program . 
 this problem is partly addressed by examining the patients who enrolled in but did not complete the cbt program . 
 ideally  these patient groups will be similar at admission to hospital  but patients who complete the cbt program will have superior outcomes . another way to address the causal role played by the cbt program is to examine the specificity of treatment changes . 
 since cbt is aimed at changing emotions  mood - related symptoms should change more during the cbt program than at other points in the inpatient admission . 
 finally  to evaluate the size of the treatment change  published treatment data were used to generate benchmark pre- and posttreatment data . 
 one study that could serve as a benchmark for patients with depression was reported by peterson and halstead . 
 they examined the effectiveness of group cbt for depressed ( i.e.  major depressive disorder single - episode and recurrent  dysthymic disorder  depressive disorder not otherwise specified  and adjustment disorder with depressed mood ) outpatients . 
 their study found a reduction from a pretreatment mean of 23.1 on the beck depression inventory ( bdi )   to 14.4 by posttreatment . 
 another relevant benchmark can be derived from studies that have conducted group psychotherapy to treat depression and used the bdi as an outcome measure . 
 reviewed these studies found 35 such studies from which they calculated an overall pretreatment mean on the bdi of 23.9 and a posttreatment mean of 12.3 . 
 this review incorporated a variety of treatments ; these values represent an acceptable benchmark because most of the studies included were versions of cbt . excluding those studies that were not cbt  the values improved the estimate of the treatment effect somewhat ( bdi before treatment of 25.5 to 11.6 at after treatment )  for clients with a mean age of 36 and a mean number of 20 therapy hours . 
 a final benchmark was an outpatient evaluation of group cbt for depressed patients treated within diagnostically heterogenous groups . 
 their outcomes for the bdi revealed a decline from 26.9  ( sd = 8.9 ) to 16.5  ( sd = 11.3 ) . 
 the effect size ( cohen 's d ) of this change was very large ( i.e.  1.2 ) with 59% of patients demonstrating a clinically significant change after treatment . 
 thus  the aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness for inpatients with depression treated with a cbt program modified to run intensively over a two - week period . 
 the total patient population comprised an archival dataset of 998 consecutive inpatient admissions diagnosed with a major depressive disorder from july 1996 to march 1999  who spent at least one day in hospital and who completed a bdi at admission to hospital . 
 patients were diagnosed using a clinical interview according to dsm - iv by their treating psychiatrist . 
 the decision to admit the person as an inpatient was made by the psychiatrist and was made when it was apparent that the required treatment could not be provided optimally while the patient was in the community . 
 the total patient group had a mean age of 43.2  ( sd = 14.4 )  and 73% were female . 
 of the total sample  46% were married  26% were separated or divorced  17% were widowed  and the remainder were never married . 
 the depressive disorders were classified as a single episode among 52% of cases and recurrent among the remaining 48% ; the depression was the primary diagnosis among 82% of patients and secondary to another diagnosis among the remainder . 
 for those with a primary diagnosis of depression  the most common recorded comorbid disorders were anxiety disorders ( 18% )  substance use ( 12% )  and personality disorders ( 5% )  and 58% of patients had at least one medical condition coded on axis iii . 
 patients spent an average of 12.3 days in hospital ( sd = 8.9 ; range of 266 days ) . 
 of the total patient group  225 began the cbt program during their inpatient stay or immediately upon discharge  and 201 ( 89% ) completed the program . 
 patients had provided consent for their data to be used for research and evaluation purposes  and the university 's human research and ethics committee approved the analysis of the deidentified data . 
 in addition to medications managed by their treating psychiatrist and the cbt program  a variety of problem - focused open group inpatient programs are available  including an acute care program  a substance abuse program  and an interpersonal therapy program . 
 thus  while patients may have had exposure to other treatments before or after the cbt program  they were not engaged in any other treatment ( except concurrent psychopharmacotherapy ) at the time . 
 the type of pharmacotherapy at admission  during the inpatient stay or at discharge  was not collected  but almost all inpatients would be on one type of medication . 
 perth clinic 's cbt program is a closed group for up to eight patients  conducted over a period of ten working days [ 5  10 ] . 
 the program begins with problem identification and goal setting  leading to psychoeducation and cognitive therapy . 
 the cognitive therapy draws upon the work of both beck   and ellis and harper   and involves self - monitoring and the identification and challenging of irrational beliefs . 
 behavioral interventions such as anxiety management and stress reduction are taught ( e.g.  relaxation  breathing control  etc . )  and patients engage in pleasant events scheduling and behavioral assignments to practise newly developed skills . in the latter part of treatment  the focus shifts to self - esteem  assertion  and communication training and concludes with a relapse prevention module . 
 the structure allows sufficient time and flexibility for the discussion of both group and individual issues . 
 there is also a supporters ' session  where each participant is invited to attend with a supporter . 
 the aim of this session is to increase awareness of psychological disorders  the nature of treatment  and helpful caring behaviors . 
 patients could complete the cbt program as an inpatient  as a daypatient ( immediately following discharge )  or being discharged from inpatient status at some point within the program . 
 the average time between admission and initiation of the cbt program was 4.9 days ( sd = 7.4 ) . 
 all patients received the questionnaires at admission  discharge  and where applicable  at the beginning and end of the cbt program . 
 questionnaires were sent to all patients who completed the cbt program at a six - week followup . 
 staff - rated measures were administered at admission and discharge by ward staff and at the beginning and end of the cbt program by the treating therapists ( clinical psychologists and occupational therapists ) . 
 the bdi is a 21-item self - report scale designed to measure the level of depression among clinical and non clinical populations and is widely used in research on depression . 
 in addition  patients completed the locus of control of behaviour scale ( lcb )   to assess their sense of control over themselves and their lives . 
 the rosenberg self - esteem scale ( rses )   was administered to measure general self - concept and consists of ten items using a four - point likert - type response format . 
 clinic staff rated patients ' general level of psychiatric symptoms using the health of a nation outcome scales ( honos ) [ 16  17 ] and global assessment of function ( gaf ) . 
 the honos is a 12-item clinician - rated scale that is comprehensive in coverage  clinically relevant  and quick to administer . 
 honos was introduced to the clinic in the middle of 1997  and therefore data are not available for one year of the study . 
 first  the change in symptoms from admission  pre - cbt  post - cbt  to 6-week followup was examined . 
 the bdi scores improved somewhat from admission ( m = 30.3 ) to pre - cbt ( m = 24.7 )   f(1152 ) = 60.76   = .29  p < .001  markedly from pre- to post - cbt ( m  12.2 )  f(1152 ) = 299.90   = .66  p < .001  and remained stable until followup ( m = 12.2 )  f(1152 ) = 0.003   = .00  p = ns . to compare the effectiveness of the present form of therapy with the results typically obtained in research trials  a 95% confidence interval was placed around the difference between pre- and posttreatment bdi scores and compared against the benchmark values identified in the introduction . 
 thus  the 95% confidence interval around the difference of 12.5 between the pre- and posttreatment bdi scores extended from 11.1 to 13.9 . the mean difference of 11.6 for studies of group psychotherapy   for depression was within this confidence interval ( as was the 13.9 difference if these studies were limited to those using cbt )  supporting that the conclusion that the difference obtained in the present investigation was comparable to that found with group treatment for depression generally . another way to examine 
 the overall effectiveness was to examine the clinical significance of the outcomes . calculating a reliable change index   and using the normative data on the bdi described by robinson et al . 
  60.2% of patients demonstrated clinically significant improvement   after treatment . comparing the present results with those of in the depressed outpatient sample  it is apparent that inpatients were more severe at admission than the outpatient population ( i.e.  m = 30.3 versus 26.9 )  but their scores had declined to less severe ( i.e.  m = 24.7 ) by the start of the cbt program . 
 this is consistent with a treatment model within which acutely unwell patients are first stabilised and then gains consolidated in a cbt program . the number of patients who demonstrated a clinically significant improvement from pre- to post - cbt ( i.e.  60.2% ) was similar to that found in an outpatient setting ( i.e.  59% ) . 
 these changes in outcome were also observable on other clinician - rated and self - reported measures . in terms of the staff - rated gaf 
  the scores rose from admission ( m = 49.3 ) to pre - cbt ( m = 56.9 )  f(1120 ) = 32.00   = .21  p 
 < .001  and continued to increase from pre- to post - cbt ( m = 69.1 )  f(1120 ) = 219.65   = .65  p < .001 . 
 patients ' lcb scores did not increase from admission ( m = 47.9 ) to pre - cbt ( m = 47.2 )  f(1151 ) = 1.24   = .01  p = ns  became substantially more by post - cbt ( m = 38.2 )  f(1151 ) = 144.14   = .49  p < .001  but it became marginally more external again by the 6-week followup ( m = 40.0 )  f(1151 ) = 6.51   = .04  p < .05 . 
 the patients ' self - esteem scores did not improve from admission ( m = 23.5 ) to pre - cbt ( m = 23.6 )  f(1102 ) = 0.03   = .000  p = ns  but they became more internal from pre to post - cbt ( m = 28.7 )  f(1102 ) = 106.87   = .51  p 
 < .001  and remained stable at the 6-week followup ( m = 28.9 )  f(1102 ) = 0.22   = .002  p = ns . although the changes during the cbt program are comparable to those in published studies  one possible interpretation of the present findings is that the patients would have improved to the same degree due to their hospital stay . to partly address this concern  
 the patients who completed the cbt program were compared at admission and discharge to hospital with those who did not begin the cbt program on the one hand and those who withdrew from the program on the other . 
 there were significant differences between the groups across these two time intervals  f(2602 ) = 3.74   = .01  p < .05 . 
 follow - up tests revealed no significant differences between groups at admission  but the patients who had completed cbt were less depressed ( m = 13.1 ) than those who never began cbt ( m = 16.6 )  t(611 ) = 2.56  p < .05  who in turn were not different from those who had dropped out of cbt ( m = 16.9 )  t(516 ) = 0.10  p = ns . 
 thus  despite the absence of differences at admission  those who completed the cbt program were the least depressed at discharge . to address the concern that the observed improvement may be due to the general effects of hospitalization rather than the specific effects of cbt  
 the profile of symptom change from admission to pre - cbt and then from pre- to post - cbt was examined . assuming a degree of symptom specificity of treatments  because cbt is focussed on symptoms of depression and anxiety 
  the changes in these domains should be greater during cbt  whereas the earlier phase in an inpatient admission will be focussed on acute symptom management . to examine these issues  the changes from admission to pre - cbt and then to post - cbt in individual honos items 
 what is apparent from figure 1 is that the inpatient stay prior to entry into cbt is associated with small changes in anxiety and depression  but substantial improvements in memory / orientation  activities of daily living  self - harm  aggression  and substance problems  whereas the cbt program is associated with the greatest changes in emotional symptoms . 
 thus  the symptoms targeted by cbt change following the treatment  but domains that are not the focus of treatment shift little during the cbt program . given the data showing that symptoms of depression improved during the time patients were in the cbt program  the effect on outcome of various clinical variables was examined . 
 of the variables examined there was no difference in bdi scores between patients from pre- to post - cbt for whom the depression was a single episode or a recurrent episode  f(1146 ) = 2.37   = .02  p = ns  or for whom the depression was judged to be primary or secondary to another disorder  f(1151 ) = 0.15   = .001  p = ns . considering those patients for whom depression was the primary disorder  there was a hint that the total number of secondary diagnoses might be associated with a poorer outcome  f(197 ) = 2.98   = .03  p = .09  but there was no indication of poorer outcomes for patients with personality disorders  f(1151 ) = 0.19   = .001  p = ns  affective disorders  f(1151 ) = 0.15   = .001  p = ns  and neurotic disorders   f(1151 ) = 0.83   = .01  p = ns . 
 although there was no difference in bdi scores before and after cbt between patients with more secondary medical conditions  f(6146 ) = 1.67   = .06  p = ns  there was a hint that patients with more secondary substance use problems might have worse outcomes  f(3149 ) = 2.44   = .05  p = .07 . 
 thus  there was no strong evidence in the present sample that presentations of major depression that were complicated by other axis i  ii  or iii were any more resistant to a cbt program than the less complicated presentations . however  there was one clinical variable that was strongly related to outcome and that was severity of depression at admission . using a trecile split to divide patients into three equal - sized groups based on admission bdi scores 
  it was apparent that the change from admission to pre - cbt  f(2150 ) = 7.20   = .09  p < .01  and from pre- to post - cbt  f(2150 ) = 16.73   = .18  p < .001  was systematically related to severity . 
 from figure 2  it is apparent that the greatest changes were observed in those with the most severe problems  but that once cbt was finished  patients maintained the level of symptoms after treatment for the next six weeks  f(2150 ) = 0.31   = .004  p = ns . 
 the present study examined the effectiveness for patients with depression of a cbt program adapted to an inpatient psychiatric clinic . the intensive program brought about reductions in depression ratings compared to those found in the literature more generally  but importantly 
  it was able to achieve these gains within a two - week period  rather than the more usual 1620 weeks of treatment . 
 the speed of the treatment gains is important because patients who require inpatient treatment are often distressed and may represent a threat to their own safety . 
 therefore  a relatively rapid treatment means that a safer environment can be provided  but the period of time when they are removed from their typical routines and support is minimized . 
 thus  cbt for depression can be adapted to an intensive program suitable for delivery within the model of care found in inpatient settings . 
 however  within inpatient settings  multiple interventions co - occur . for the present study  
 this means that it is not possible to use the data to conclude that the cbt program caused the symptom changes . 
 however  this is an empirical issue that has already been answered numerous times in controlled efficacy studies  and the present question is related to the effectiveness of cbt in a particular context . in particular  it is also clear that packaging a cbt program as part of an inpatient treatment program can deliver comparable treatment outcomes to spaced treatments  but it did not achieve these outcomes at the expense of longevity of treatment gains . 
 the gains observed were stable over the six - week followup  and there was no evidence that the more severe patients were any more likely to return to problematic levels following the termination of the program . from a clinical perspective  a common issue raised among practitioners is that the treatments developed and then demonstrated in efficacy studies will not generalize to  real - world  clinical settings . in our experience  
 common reasons given for the lack of generalization include the greater severity of patients outside efficacy studies  the higher occurrence of comorbidity ( especially substance use and personality disorders ) since these patients can rarely be prohibited from receiving treatment in the way that they may be appropriately excluded from an efficacy study  and the setting itself . 
 therefore  it was curious to see that in the present sample  the only variable that was associated with differential outcomes was symptom severity such that the greatest change was observed in the patients who were most depressed . given that other studies have found that comorbidity and type of depression have an impact on outcome  it is intriguing that the present study failed to find these differences . 
 one possible reason for the lack of a difference is the intensity of the program . 
 there may be greater opportunity for the comorbid conditions to interfere with treatment when an intervention extends to months  whereas in an intense cbt program that fills most of the day  there may be less opportunity for these associated conditions to manifest themselves . 
 for instance  a person with a substance use problem may be able to maintain harm - free use or abstinence for a couple of weeks while in treatment  whereas over a few months  this might be more difficult . without random assignment to intensive or spaced treatment sessions  it is not possible to offer any more than this as a speculative suggestion  but the present data would encourage investigation of the benefits and costs of alternative forms of delivery . 
 in considering the results  there are a number of limitations that need to be borne in mind . 
 first  the hospital is a private clinic where the patients are insured  and therefore  the extent of generalization to the public sector is not clear . 
 it is possible that even though comorbid conditions are present  the severity or types of comorbidity that may be present in public hospitals ( e.g.  a greater frequency of psychotic disorders ) may mean that particular presentations were not represented in the current sample . 
 second  by its nature  the present investigation was a retrospective examination of effectiveness and not a randomized controlled trial . 
 therefore  there are a variety of issues that make it hard to conclude that the cbt program caused the observed effects . 
 it is possible that the symptom changes that are observed during the cbt program may not be attributable to the program  but due to patient selection and other factors associated with hospital care ( e.g.  concurrent pharmacotherapy ) . 
 while these can not be ruled out  attempts were made to examine the degree to which these variables may have affected the data . 
 the difference between inpatients who began the cbt program and those who did not suggests that the cbt program is providing benefits over and above  treatment as usual .  the benefits by discharge for people who began cbt and finished it  relative to those who dropped out  address the issue that staff selected cbt patients who were likely to improve regardless of the content of treatment  because those who dropped out were not different at admission or discharge from those who never began cbt . 
 in addition  the apparent specificity of the treatment gains that occurred during cbt speaks against arguments about the general effect of being in hospital as causing the reductions in symptoms . 
 however  while it remains possible that the treatment did not cause the observed outcomes  given that cbt has been demonstrated to be an efficacious treatment for depression and the current treatment effects were comparable to those observed in the efficacy studies  it is not unreasonable to presume that the application of an empirically validated treatment  albeit in a modified form  was largely responsible for the observed improvements . third  the present study did not set out to establish the efficacy of cbt  but to examine the effectiveness within a clinical setting and relied on the patients ' self - reports and the judgments of the treating clinicians . 
 although the internal validity of the ratings is less than those carried out by a person blind to the treatment  the external validity of the ratings ( when conducted by clinicians who have spent two weeks with the patient ) is greater . 
 nonetheless  there is a possibility for bias as patients may have tried to please therapists  and the staff may have overestimated the change to a greater degree in the cbt program than in the hospital more generally . 
 finally  it is important to note that in contrast to efficacy studies  in a hospital context  it is not possible to exclude patients from a treatment with a bdi below a cut - off ( e.g.  )  that is  the decision to treat a particular patient will involve a consideration of the self - reported severity of the depression  but other factors will also be taken into account  and therefore  the sample contains individuals who might not meet the criteria for inclusion in an efficacy study  applying such a criterion ( by excluding them from the analyses ) if anything strengthens the conclusions of the present study  since the pre- to post - cbt scores change from 28.4 to 13.2 ; increasing the absolute treatment difference from 12.5 bdi points when all patients are included to 15.2 points . despite these limitations  it appears reasonable to conclude that cbt can be adapted to an inpatient psychiatric clinic  and the effectiveness of such a program is comparable to that observed in more homogenous patient samples found in efficacy studies . 
 however  it is not clear from the present study the degree to which the apparent lack of comorbidity and type of depression to interfere with treatment outcomes is associated with the intensity of the treatment  the setting of the therapy  and the temporal location in the overall treatment program when cbt was delivered . 
 future research could investigate these questions and in so doing assist in clarifying the most effective way to deliver treatment in different settings to different patient presentations . 
 another future research question could relate to the ability to deliver cbt to homogeneous patient groups . 
 the patients in the present study were all diagnosed with depression  but they were treated within a group of patients where not all suffered from depression . 
 the clinic provides a cbt program and makes it available to patients who might benefit from the program  and therefore a mixture of other primary diagnoses . 
 although it was not possible to evaluate the outcomes of these other patients ( because the numbers of each diagnostic group were small  the outcome measures were not specific to the conditions  and there was not a sufficient literature on the disorders with the measures used to benchmark against the present data )  it is clear that at least for people with depression  they can be treated alongside patients with other conditions without degradation of their treatment outcomes . 
 the therapy staff observes that the mixed patient groups  rather than being a hindrance  are an assistance to therapy  since patients can assist one another in helping each other with their different problems . 
 the degree to which this clinical observation can be replicated in a controlled study  it should be possible to start to isolate the factors that are beneficial about treating heterogenous patient groups . 
 the present study can not identify the extent to which incorporating cbt into an inpatient program can reduce the overall length of hospital stay . 
 the length of stay at the present clinic is relatively short  when compared to other private psychiatric clinics in australia which treat similar patient groups ( moira munro  personal communication  27  october 2011 )  but different to public psychiatric hospitals ( which tend to treat proportionally more people with schizophrenia ) . 
 one possible explanation is the reliance on adjunctive psychotherapy  and we have shown elsewhere that the addition of psychotherapy enhances the outcomes following an inpatient stay . 
 however  the duration of hospital stay varies markedly across health care systems and countries  and therefore  this question is probably better addressed using multilevel modelling  where hospitals are nested with relevant units ( e.g.  healthcare system  nation  etc . ) . in conclusion 
  the present study found that an evidence - based treatment for depression could be modified to an inpatient treatment setting without substantial loss of effectiveness . 
 clinically  this is important because people are often admitted as inpatients when suicide risk is high  and therefore  data consistent with the view that adding cbt to the treatment is available at such times is associated with a rapid reduction in symptoms . for a suicidal patient  
 a reduction in symptoms is going to be associated with a lowered risk of harm  and therefore  the sooner the reduction can be achieved  the sooner a less intensive treatment regime can the implemented . 
 in addition  some concerns in generalizing from efficacy studies to clinical effectiveness that arise due to complexity of patients ( e.g.  comorbidity ) were addressed  and no strong evidence was found that these issues compromised outcomes in the present study .","


1) Abstract: A study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a modified cognitive behavior therapy program for inpatients with depression. Significant improvements were found in measures of depression, mental health, and overall functioning, comparable to longer-term studies on CBT. 

2) Research and Discussion: The study included 300 inpatient admissions with depression and used various scales to assess changes before and after a 2-week CBT program. Results showed significant improvements, indicating that CBT could be successfully integrated into inpatient services for depression treatment. 

3) Results and Conclusion: The study demonstrated the effectiveness of a 2-week CBT program for inpatients with depression, reflected by improvements on various measures. This suggests that CBT could be a valuable addition to inpatient services for treating depression. Further research and exploration of CBT in inpatient settings is recommended."
"retinal vein occlusion ( rvo ) is an obstruction of the retinal venous system  it has an abrupt onset and is an important cause of visual morbidity . 
 retinal vein occlusions constitute the second most common cause of retinal vascular disease after diabetic retinopathy  with a prevalence of between 1% and 2% in persons older than 40 years of age [ 25 ] . in the wisconsin beaver dam eye study  
 12% of eyes that developed severe visual impairment ( best corrected visual acuity 20/200 ) during a 15-year followup were due to rvo . 
 although the exact etiology of rvo is not known  it is likely to follow a thrombotic event  possibly caused by external compression or disease of the vein wall [ 1  7 ] . 
 rvo can be categorized as branch retinal vein occlusion ( brvo )  if the obstruction is located in one of the branches of the central vein ; or central retinal vein occlusion ( crvo )  if it is located in the central vein  at the level of the optic nerve . 
 brvo encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders with different clinical aspects   and presents with dilated and tortuous retinal venous system in a particular quadrant or hemisphere of the retina and is often associated with macular edema . 
 crvo is presented with hemorrhagic changes in all four quadrants of the retina and dilated and tortuous veins . in both brvo and crvo  cotton wool spots  disc edema  and neovascularization 
 the incidence of rvo has been estimated to be 0.12%/year in adults aged 45 years for brvo and 0.04%/year in adults aged 45 years for crvo in caucasian populations [ 6  11 ] . 
 however  the canadian incidence of visual impairment ( vi ) due to macular edema ( me ) secondary to rvo is unknown . 
 this study aims to determine the annual incidence of vi and characteristics of patients with me secondary to brvo and crvo in a real - world canadian setting . 
 records from a longitudinal population - based database of more than 170000 patients in 53 family practice clinics in southwestern ontario  canada were analyzed between january 1  2008 and december 31  2009 . 
 these records contained chart - abstracted information such as visit diagnosis  medications  and consultation notes .   in order to compare characteristics and comorbidities of patients with diabetic macular edema ( dme ) to those of the general population  
 a control cohort was constructed by matching age and gender for all patients in the database > 18 years by clinic location . 
 initial extractions of control cohort and rvo patients with me  ( defined as retinal thickening within 500  m of the macular center ) and vi ( defined as best corrected visual acuity 20/40 in the rvo eye )  were accomplished utilizing international classification of disease codes ( icd9/icd10 )  reviewing patient charts for text entries of symptoms that supported a diagnosis of rvo and concomitant comorbidity  and reviewing patient treatment records unique to rvo including consultation notes and hospital discharge summaries . 
 data included in this study comprised patient characteristics and demographics  cardiovascular comorbidity and events  and medication coverage . 
 the swo database has recorded patient level data on the clinical diagnoses at each visit  symptoms corroborating the diagnoses  clinical data  prescribed treatments including lifestyle interventions and medications  physician visits  hospitalizations  and diagnostic / laboratory test results  allowing for the conduct of patient level analyses  since 2000 . 
 data from the 53 practices participating in the swo database cohort are routinely updated on a quarterly basis with immediate reconciliation at the point of care . 
 all practices included in the swo database are part of a family practice research network involved in various audit and clinical research activities . 
 practices have consented to centralized accrual of clinical data from the patient record ( uwo irb 09572 ) . 
 each patient 's ontario health insurance plan ( ohip ) number is assigned a unique patient identification number in the swo database . to protect the privacy of patient 's medical information  a 128-bit ssl certificate is installed on the production swo web server . 
 the industry standard data protection method ensures the security of data during transmission across the internet . 
 validation studies of the swo database confirming the quality and completeness of the recorded data show good agreement between estimates of the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors obtained from the swo database and other published estimates [ 1215 ] . 
 moreover  there is a correlation between the swo database and national data ( i.e.  ims  brogan pharmastat ) on the utilization of prescription medication ( personal communication  petrella ; kamino  ims ) . 
 starting from the index date ( the date of the first diagnosis of rvo during the study period until december 2009 )  all subjects meeting inclusion / exclusion criteria were analyzed to understand the demographics and treatment patterns of care . for treated patients  the treatment choices were characterized  and the treatment pattern was related to clinical characteristics of patients  including type of drug coverage ( public  private  out of pocket ) .   for continuous variables  the mean  standard deviation  median  minimum and maximum values were estimated . 
 for categorical variables  the number and percentage of each category within an assessment was calculated for non - missing data . 
 73 of 47166 patients over 40 years of age with new diagnosis of rvo and a control cohort of 76077 patients were extracted for this analysis . 
 please refer to table 1 for data on demographics for the control and rvo cohorts . 
 examination of recorded episodes during the observation period by gender and age revealed the following : only 8% of patients with a new diagnosis of rvo during this time were males between the ages of 4059 years  compared with 43% of females in that age group . 
 ninety - two percent of males with new diagnoses of rvo were over the age of 60  compared to 54% of females . 
 a higher percentage of caucasian ( 81% ) and aboriginal ( 11% ) ethnic groups were affected by rvo compared to their respective groupings ( 78% and 9% ) within the control cohort . 
 please refer to table 2 for data on disease characteristics for the control and rvo cohorts . 
 more rvo patients were overweight ( 23% ) or obese ( 13% ) compared to the control cohort . 
 more rvo patients had hypertension ( 68% versus 14% ) or dyslipidemia ( 16% versus 10% ) than control cohort ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 one quarter of rvo patients had a history of vascular disease  primarily mi and stroke . fifteen percent of patients with rvo suffer from chronic kidney disease 
 .   please refer to table 3 for data on incidence and type of rvo within the rvo cohort . 
 seventy - three patients over 40 years old with a new diagnosis of rvo were identified from 47166 patients over 40 years old . 
 fifty - three patients had brvo  and 20 patients had crvo as interpreted from consultation notes . 
 the annual incidence of vi due to me secondary to brvo and crvo was found to be 0.056%  95% ci ( 0.0110.072 ) and 0.021%  95% ci ( 0.0080.081 )  respectively . as shown in table 4  majority of patients had public drug coverage . 
 macular edema ( me ) is a complication of rvo that can lead to blindness . 
 this was the first study to assess the incidence of vi due to me secondary to brvo and crvo and to describe the disease characteristics of patients with rvo in a canadian setting . 
 a few other studies have assessed the incidence of rvo . in the australian blue mountains eye study  
 the 5-year incidence of any rvo was 1.0%  and the 10-year incidence was 1.6% ; in the us  the 5-year incidence was 0.8%  and the 15-year incidence was 2.3% ; and in japan  the 9-year incidence was reported at 2.0% . 
 the incidence of brvo appears generally higher than the incidence of crvo . in all these studies  as in ours  the small number of individuals that developed incident rvo makes it difficult to know with accuracy the ratio of incident brvo to incident crvo and to use these estimates as a basis for comparison . more males ( 92% ) over 60 years versus 54% females had the diagnosis of rvo . 
 rvo is rarely seen in individuals younger than 50  but may affect up to 5% of individuals over the age of 80as noted by laouri et al . in a review of the literature on the burden of retinal vein occlusion . 
 consistent with previous literature  we found that patients with rvo were more likely to present hypertension  dyslipidemia  or vascular diseases compared with general population [ 4  1719 ] . 
 further  our findings concur with previous studies that found risk factors more common in patients with brvo .   as observed by lattanzio et al . 
  given the close association of rvo with systemic vascular disease  new patients with rvo should be evaluated for hypertension  diabetes  and lipid abnormalities  as it may be  the presentation of significant vascular morbidity  . in the case of younger patients  who may be otherwise healthy  the pathogenesis and risk factors are still poorly understood and additional evaluation of coagulation disorders and a history of thromboses may be necessary [ 8  20 ] . 
 this retrospective study was conducted utilizing icd9/icd10 disease codes and reviewing patient charges and treatment records  including consultation notes and hospital discharge summaries . 
 brvo and crvo are easily detected using standard ophthalmological diagnostic tools and techniques  so while the diagnosis and classification of rvo are valid  difficulties in interpreting data contained in consultation notes  as well as data concerning number of episodes requiring consultation and treatment during the observation period  may have resulted in some inconsistencies in data capture . 
 this paper presents a description of the characteristics of patients with vi due to me secondary to brvo and crvo in a real - world canadian setting . 
 consistent with findings in other studies  rvo in this patient population was associated with several vascular comorbidities . 
 the annual incidence of vi due to me secondary to brvo and crvo was estimated to be 0.056% and 0.021%  respectively .",".

1)Abstract: This observational, retrospective study investigates the incidence and characteristics of visual impairment (VI) due to macular edema (ME) secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in a Canadian population. The results show a higher incidence of branch RVO and an association with comorbidities such as hypertension and dyslipidemia.

2)Research and Discussion: The study used data from the southwestern Ontario database to identify 73 RVO patients, of which 53 had branch RVO and 20 had central RVO. The annual incidence of ME secondary to RVO was found to be 0.056% for branch RVO and 0.021% for central RVO. Significant associations were also observed between RVO and hypertension and dyslipidemia.

3)Results and Conclusion: This study provides insight into the characteristics of RVO patients with VI due to ME in a Canadian setting. The higher incidence of branch RVO and associations with hypertension and dyslipidemia highlight the need for early detection and management of these comorbidities in RVO patients to prevent severe vision loss. Further research is needed to better understand the impact of ME secondary to RVO on the Canadian population. "
"it has been well documented in medical literature that diabetes management during ramadan fasting poses challenges to the treating physician ; and pre - ramadan diabetes assessment  evaluations  and diabetes education are important for successful management.1 this is because unplanned diabetes management during ramadan fasting may lead to hypoglycemia . 
 hence  in the past few decades  efforts have been made by various researchers to manage diabetes during ramadan fasting without the risk of hypoglycemia . 
 these include alteration / reduction of the dosages for oral hypoglycemic agents ( ohas ) and insulins  and shifting patients from ohas and insulins to metformin or other agents such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( dpp-4 ) inhibitors . 
 the increase in hypoglycemic events during the month of ramadan has been previously reported in the literature . 
 the epidemiology of diabetes and ramadan ( epidiar ) study has reported a 7.5-fold increase in risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.2 however  this risk can be reduced by extensive diabetes education and pre - ramadan medication adjustments.1 hence  ramadan itself is not a risk  but poor education and use of medications which cause hypoglycemia with high dosages carries a risk . 
 hypoglycemia itself has an adverse effect on the quality of life  is an obstacle while managing diabetes ( to control glycemia )  and is associated with poor compliance to medication and treatment . 
 it has also been well documented that skipping meals and a reduced food intake are the main causes for the hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting . 
 hence  diabetes education plays a central role  and diabetic patients should be given education and counseling before ramadan fasting.134 in general  severe hypoglycemia carries a risk of morbidities  with major cardiovascular events such as stroke  myocardial ischemia / failure  and ventricular arrhythmias.5 for these reasons  allowing patients to fast / fasting during ramadan without risk of hypoglycemia is a personal / patient - centered decision . 
 a study conducted in saudi arabia by aziz1 on 1046 patients has demonstrated that ramadan fasting itself does not pose a risk to human metabolism or health  but conversely has beneficial health effects on physiological parameters ( eg  an opportunity to lose weight ) and on chronic disease prevention . 
 this study has demonstrated that this goal can be achieved only by optimal pre - ramadan assessment and diabetes education.1 similar observations were reported in other studies as well.68 however  in 2003  laarijani et al9 demonstrated a slight decrease in fasting serum glucose among healthy subjects during ramadan fasting . a similar 
 finding has also been demonstrated by aziz1 in the ramadan study  with the lowest prevalence of hypoglycemia ( 4.58% ) . 
 contrary to these facts  different studies conducted in the past during ramadan fasting have demonstrated high prevalence of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting ( up to 21.7%).1018 however  these studies were mostly observational in nature  and patients were not selected before ramadan for extensive diabetes self - management education ( dsme )  counseling  assessment for hba1c / creatinine  and alteration of therapy . hence in other words  it can be concluded  in general  that blood glucose levels fall during ramadan fasting in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects  and prevention of hypoglycemia with medication adjustments / alterations are the basic strategies to manage diabetes during ramadan fasting . with this literature background  
 the current review focuses on a class of medications which does not cause hypoglycemia  both in general and during ramadan fasting . 
 one of them is dpp-4 inhibitors  and the drug available in the market is vildagliptin . we will focus on the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes  dpp-4 inhibitors  and the role of vildagliptin during ramadan fasting . 
 dpp-4 inhibitors are the new oral antidiabetic agents ( including vildagliptin sitagliptin  saxagliptin  linagliptin  alogliptin and other agents as well which are under extensive research ) . 
 these agents / drugs reduce serum glucose concentrations and improve the glycemic control by augmenting the effects of  incretins  ; hence this strategy is also called  incretin based therapy  for diabetes management . under normal physiological state  the gut  in response to meals  releases hormones called incretins  for example  glp-1 ( glucagon like peptide-1 ) and gip ( gastric inhibitory polypeptide )  which augment biosynthesis and secretion of insulin ( known as incretin effect ) as well as slow gastric emptying as well.1924 normally  these incretin hormones are degraded within minutes after their release by the enzyme dpp-4 . as the dpp-4 inhibitors  
 contrary to this normal physiology  in diabetic patients the balance between insulin secretion and hepatic glucose production is dysregulated . in type 1 diabetic subjects 
  there is absolute insulin deficiency due to autoimmunity against -cells with destruction of these cells  as compared with type 2 diabetic subjects who exhibit relative insulin deficiency with insulin resistance.2526 furthermore  absolute or relative hyperglucagonemia  due to deficiency of incretin hormones in diabetic state  is a hallmark of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects.2728 in other words  in type 2 diabetic subjects  there is insulin resistance and hyperglucagonemia . due to these pathophysiological states  lipolysis and ketosis 
 may worsen the metabolic state leading to diabetic ketoacidosis ( dka ) during prolonged fasting  with absolute or relative insulin deficiency.2930 insulin resistance can be reversed by metformin  and hyperglucagonemia by incretin based therapy . 
 additionally  vildagliptin has also been shown to improve -cell function in type 2 diabetics  apart from enhancing incretin effect.31 other research studies have demonstrated efficacy of vildagliptin to lower hba1c and improve glycemic control as well.3236 hence  reversion of diminished incretin effect is also essential to manage diabetes effectively  both in general and during ramadan fasting  while preventing hypoglycemia at the same time . 
 one of the interesting phenomena of dpp-4 inhibitor or vildagliptin is that it is blood glucose - dependent and does not cause hypoglycemia when given as monotherapy  which is again a therapeutic advantage of dpp-4 inhibitors / vildagliptin during ramadan fasting . 
 in this section the literature for the safety and efficacy of vildagliptin during ramadan fasting will be reviewed . 
 sulfonylureas ( sus ) and oral hypoglycemic agents ( ohas ) are still widely used by general practitioners as oral antidiabetic agents  both in general and during ramadan fasting  because of their ability to effectively reduce hba1c and their low cost.3738 however  they carry a higher risk of severe hypoglycemia  especially if dose is not reduced during ramadan fasting  and special precautions are required  together with individual considerations  especially in older age group.139 hence  highly variable rates of hypoglycemia have been reported in published research trials with sus / ohas ( 3%40% ) during ramadan fasting . 
 however  this risk was significantly reduced when vildagliptin was prescribed during ramadan fasting  and this has also been recently reported in indo - pakistani populations from the uk and in cohorts of uk south asian muslim patients in the vector ( vildagliptin experience compared to gliclazide observed during ramadan ) study.4042 furthermore  in general  these agents have also been demonstrated to be safer in older age group.43 a recent observational study which combined metformin and vildagliptin therapy together with or without ohas during ramadan fasting has demonstrated advantage of reduced hypoglycemia incidence.44 they have shown one case of severe hypoglycemia in the arm treated with oha compared to the vildagliptin group  which showed no hypoglycemia event . 
 the hypoglycemia events were 12 times more in the group treated with oha as compared to the vildagliptin group . 
 other studies have reported similar results when comparing ohas with vildagliptin.45 another study conducted on vildagliptin and sus or ohas during ramadan fasting has reported higher incidence of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting in the group treated with su and metformin vs vildagliptin plus metformin ( 26 episodes vs 19 episodes ) ; and also reported hba1c reduction in the vildagliptin group  however  with insignificant p - values.46 a study conducted by aziz1 has also concluded that the patient group prescribed with dpp-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin / vildagliptin did not show any episodes of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting . a recent review published in switzerland and france 
 has studied worldwide the role of dpp-4 inhibitors ( including vildagliptin ) during ramadan fasting  and has come to the conclusion that the anti - diabetic agents dpp-4 inhibitors could be a more safer option while managing type-2 diabetes during ramadan fasting  with a very low risk of hypoglycemia.47 another prospective  noninterventional study published in france to assess real life rate of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting in patients with type 2 diabetes and their ongoing dual therapy of metformin  vildagliptin or metformin  sulfonylurea has shown that hypoglycemia as an adverse events ( aes ) was higher in su group as compared to vildagliptin group ( 17.9% vs 7.5% ; p=0.025 )  and better compliance was seen with vildagliptin group.48 the virtue ( vildagliptin experience compared with sulphonylureas observed during ramadan ) study  which recruited 1333 patients from 10 different countries worldwide  has demonstrated significantly fewer hypoglycemia events as compared with su therapy ( 5.4% vs 19.8%  respectively ; p<0.001 ) . additionally  good glycemic and weight control and better tolerance were observed in vildagliptin - treated patients.49 the steadfast ( study evaluating vildagliptin compared to gliclazide in patients with type 2 diabetes fasting during ramadan ) study  a multicenter  double - blind  and randomized trial  which recruited 557 type 2 diabetic patients has demonstrated significantly lower hypoglycemia prevalence as compared to sus ( 3.0% vs 7.0%  respectively ; p=0.039).50 similar results have been reported in the muslim populations of india.51 in summary  vildagliptin has been proven to be effective  well tolerated  and associated with low incidence of hypoglycemia in recent clinical trials . 
 this is true especially in high risk population such as elderly and those with renal impairment or those who require insulin based therapy with metformin and dpp-4 inhibitors.445256 
 despite the islamic rule of exemption  most of the diabetic patients essentially fast during ramadan ; and this fact should be considered while managing diabetes during ramadan fasting.12 drugs such as dpp-4 inhibitors / vildagliptin should be selected with other diabetes medications as these are not associated with high risk of hypoglycemia . it has been observed that general practitioners have limited knowledge of diabetes management during ramadan fasting . 
 furthermore  survey results have shown that 53% of patients fasted against medical advice.57 however  this can be prevented effectively by extensive dsme and ramadan - focused diabetes management ; ramadan education and awareness in diabetes ( read ) program and similar studies have demonstrated promising and good results in terms of minimizing hypoglycemia risk during ramadan fasting.15859 effective diabetes education for patients empowerment and motivation with self - care awareness involves health care professional teams  families  the community  and religious authorities as well.6061 additionally  newer antidiabetic agents  such as vildagliptin ( dpp-4 inhibitor )  that are associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia  are considered to be one of the safer options while managing diabetes during ramadan fasting  and have also shown higher treatment adherence as compared to other medications.62",".

Abstract:
During Ramadan fasting, managing diabetes to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia is challenging for physicians, especially with the use of oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) and sulfonylureas (SUs). However, newer antidiabetic agents like dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, specifically vildagliptin, have demonstrated a lower risk of hypoglycemia and better patient compliance.

Research and Discussion:
Recent research and clinical trials have shown that vildagliptin has a comparative safety and efficacy profile, with a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared to OHAs and SUs. This finding is especially important during Ramadan fasting, where the risk of hypoglycemia is increased. In addition, proper diabetes education, pre-Ramadan assessments, and use of vildagliptin can help minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetic patients.

Results and Conclusion:
Evidence-based clinical trials and observations have demonstrated the effectiveness of vildagliptin in minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia during Ramadan fasting. Along with proper diabetes self-management education and pre-Ramadan assessments, using vildagliptin can improve patient care and outcomes during this challenging time. Therefore, including vildagliptin in the management of type 2 diabetes during Ramadan fasting can be beneficial for both physicians and patients."
"pseudoprogression ( pspd ) and pseudoresponse ( psr ) following anticancer therapy are major areas of controversy in the management of high - grade glioma . in the era of temozolomide  discrimination of pspd and true progression of high - grade glioma after concurrent radiochemotherapy ( crt ) with conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) 
 novel imaging modalities such as mr spectroscopy  positron emission tomography ( pet )  and perfusion mri are showing promising results but have yet to be validated in prospective studies . 
 we previously reported the significance of overexpression of p53 for predicting development of pspd10 ) . 
 in addition to the method of interpretation for early radiologic deterioration  when to determine this is also a critical issue because it affects the clinician 's decision making regarding whether to switch to salvage therapy for recurrent disease or to continue planned adjuvant therapy . 
 as pspd was termed "" early necrosis "" in early reports  many series determined pspd at 4 weeks after treatment . 
 conversely  wen et al.28 ) proposed new response assessment in neuro - oncology ( rano ) working group criteria for high - grade glioma . 
 an increasing non - enhancing component in t2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( flair ) mr images was considered to be progression for patients receiving anti - angiogenic therapy with the new criteria . 
 they also suggested that progression can be true progression only in the cases of recurrence outside the radiation field or in pathologically confirmed cases  if radiological progression is detected within 12 weeks when pspd is most prevalent . 
 however  further validation would be necessary because this suggestion is not based on a clinical study that demonstrates comparable survival outcome between early true progression ( 4 weeks after treatment ; etpd ) and late true progression ( progression between 4 and 12 weeks after treatment ; ltpd ) . 
 if the survival difference between etpd and ltpd are significant  early progressive findings should be treated based on the assumption that the lesion would be the recurrent tumor . 
 psr is the concept that represents temporary radiological improvement after using an antiangiogenic agent such as bevacizumab while having progression in effect . 
 phase ii trials using bevacizumab and cpt-11 in recurrent malignant glioma have shown a high response rate of 63%  but this encouraging result did not lead to a significantly improved overall survival ( os)1127 ) . 
 this phenomenon has been proposed to represent the effect of bevacizumab normalizing the permeability of leaky endothelium that causes edema  showing a steroid - like feature . in the present study 
  we evaluated pspd following radiation therapy combined with concurrent temozolomide ( tmz ) and also assessed psr following anti - angiogenic therapy for patients with recurrent disease using criteria of the rano working group . 
 all data from patients diagnosed with world health organization ( who ) grade 3 or 4 glioma from march 2005 to february 2011 were retrieved from the archives of the pathologic reports . 
 the clinical and pathologic data of relevant patients were obtained in accordance with the protocol approved by the institutional review board . 
 fifty - five of sixty - two patients with high - grade glioma who received radiotherapy ( rt ) with concurrent and adjuvant tmz were included in the present study . 
 gross total resection was performed in 16 ( 29% ) patients  subtotal or near total resection was performed in 25 ( 45% ) patients  and stereotactic biopsy was performed in 14 ( 26% ) patients . 
 the median dose used for radiation therapy was 61.2 gy ( range  59.4 - 61.2 gy ) with daily fractions of 1.8 - 2.0 gy . 
 forty - five patients received a total dose of 61.2 gy in 34 fractions  nine patients received 60 gy in 30 fractions  and one patient received 59.4 gy in 33 fractions . 
 the median time from surgery to the initiation of crt was 26 days ( range of 11 - 77 days ) . 
 tmz concomitant with postoperative rt was administered at 75 mg / m a day . for adjuvant tmz  
 150 - 200 mg / m was administered daily for 5 days  every 28 days . in terms of salvage therapy following recurrence

 all data from patients diagnosed with world health organization ( who ) grade 3 or 4 glioma from march 2005 to february 2011 were retrieved from the archives of the pathologic reports . 
 the clinical and pathologic data of relevant patients were obtained in accordance with the protocol approved by the institutional review board . 
 fifty - five of sixty - two patients with high - grade glioma who received radiotherapy ( rt ) with concurrent and adjuvant tmz were included in the present study . 
 gross total resection was performed in 16 ( 29% ) patients  subtotal or near total resection was performed in 25 ( 45% ) patients  and stereotactic biopsy was performed in 14 ( 26% ) patients . 
 the median dose used for radiation therapy was 61.2 gy ( range  59.4 - 61.2 gy ) with daily fractions of 1.8 - 2.0 gy . 
 forty - five patients received a total dose of 61.2 gy in 34 fractions  nine patients received 60 gy in 30 fractions  and one patient received 59.4 gy in 33 fractions . 
 the median time from surgery to the initiation of crt was 26 days ( range of 11 - 77 days ) . 
 tmz concomitant with postoperative rt was administered at 75 mg / m a day . for adjuvant tmz  150 - 200 mg 
 / m was administered daily for 5 days  every 28 days . in terms of salvage therapy following recurrence 
  the surgical resection was performed for the patients who had a small progressive lesion involving non - eloquent area  and gamma knife surgery was reserved for the cases with small lesions and medically inoperable condition . 
 bevacizumab with or without cpt-11 was considered as a primary option for salvage therapy in all inoperable cases showing true progression . 
 the patients who had previous episode of intracranial hemorrhage or who were not be able to afford bevacizumab received nimustine ( acnu)/cisplatin ( cddp ) or procarbazine  lomustine  and vincristine ( pcv ) chemotherapy  or metronomic tmz . 
 mri with gadolinium enhancement and t2/flair was performed 1 month after crt and every 3 months thereafter . when a progressive finding was present  mri was performed at 2-month intervals .

 all patients were treated with rt combined with concurrent and adjuvant tmz after surgical resection or stereotactic biopsy . 
 nine ( 24% ) of thirty - seven patients with disease progression during all treatment period and 1 case of pspd were treated with bevacizumab with or without cpt-11 . 
 surgical resection  gamma knife surgery  acnu / cddp  pcv chemotherapy  or metronomic tmz were also used as an option for the salvage therapy . in 13 of 55 patients 
 cbv  adc  or pet were undertaken  and it was insufficient number to analyze the efficiency of the techniques . 
 the exams only provided additional information and were not absolute means of diagnosis . at the first follow - up after crt  21 patients ( 38% ) showed radiologic progression . and at second post - crt mri  16 ( 29% ) of them persistently showed progression and considered as etpd . 
 five ( 9% ) of those patients showed progression after the first mri taken at post - treatment 4 weeks and showed improvement afterwards without specific salvage treatment with a decreasing or stable dose of dexamethasone . 
 these groups of patients were finally categorized as pspd . and at second post - crt mri  7 showed new progression that was not seen in previous mri ( ltpd ) . 
 the follow - up time was defined as the period between surgery ( including stereotactic biopsy ) and the last follow - up day or death .

 all showed rapid regrowth of the tumor immediately after discontinuation of bevacizumab on mri ( fig . 
 the primary goal of this study was to evaluate the survival difference between etpd and ltpd . 
 thus  we could not identify a statistically significant survival difference between the two groups  indicating that it would be safe to continue planned adjuvant tmz rather than treatment for recurrence when radiologic progression appears in the first post - treatment mri . 
 this unique treatment strategy dealing with radiologic progression for high - grade glioma comes from the absence of a diagnostic modality providing high accuracy and resemblance between in - field recurrence and treatment response as pspd or radiation necrosis . 
 the mechanism of pspd which is exclusive phenomenon in high - grade glioma  is not clarified  but might be related to the nature of tumor itself . 
 blood tumor barrier of glioma has high expression of p - glycoprotein  a 170-kda drug efflux pump protein  which is the main component of blood brain barrier ( bbb ) and inhibits penetration23 ) . generally  glioblastoma has compromised barrier that gadolinium can penetrate and shows enhancement . 
 bbb breakage after rt has been well documented but the mechanism is unclear . in vitro study 
 showed that rt induces early transient increase in paracellular permeability while maintaining the tight junction of capillary endothelial cells6 ) . 
 an experimental study revealed that higher exposures of tmz in brain tumor can also attribute to breakdown of the bbb20 ) . 
 increased permeability of blood tumor barrier caused by rt and tmz would result in contrast enhancement due to leakage  which presents as pspd . 
 rano criteria were suggested to overcome the limitation of macdonald criteria and drew considerable attentions . 
 although it provides innovative assessment in the treatment of malignant glioma  yet several limitations were pointed out as discriminating true or false lesions in non - enhancing lesions  too simple tumor size measurement  and not reflecting any of new imaging techniques14 ) . despite current criteria as macdonald or rano  purely objective judgement of treatment response only with imaging 
 increased cbv / cbf and a decreased adc value do not imply progressive disease at all times  however  the decisions are made from these novel imaging modalities for most of the confusing cases . 
 latest imaging techniques as dynamic susceptibility contrast mri perfusion  diffusion - weighted mri  mri / pet scans using biomarker  and thallium single photon emission ct are introduced but no comparison under prospective studies have been performed21329 ) . 
 thus  disparity sometimes in clinical judgment between oncologists and radiologists makes further treatment planning more complex and often needs to be discussed by a multidisciplinary tumor board . 
 for example  one patient who was considered to show pspd in our last study was confirmed to show true progression by surgery . in this case  cbv was not increased and the tumor demonstrated stabilization after 4 weeks at the second post - treatment mri  which could be considered to be pspd . 
 recently  vogelbaum et al.26 ) suggested that retrospective assessments of serial images to distinguish pspd form true progression and when the finding is ambiguous  the response should be called indeterminate even with rano criteria . 
 this shows despite the latest techniques and reorganization of the criteria they do not guarantee more reliable diagnosis or appropriate further treatment plan therefore validation should be needed . 
 retrospective comparative analysis among various criteria has been performed placing emphasis on the nonenhancing tumor8 ) . 
 the major component that we adopted from rano was the timing of decision making as well as imaging criteria . 
 appropriate timing is crucial in avoiding the misdiagnosis that would lead to discontinuation or initiation of the effective therapy . 
 also in canadian recommendations pspd can not be diagnosed until 12 weeks after the end of rt unless new lesion shows out - of - field5 ) . in the review of sanghera et al.22 )  timing of defining pspd varied from 2 weeks to 6 months among 8 studies . considering that most of the decisions are made at 4 weeks or 6 months in performed studies  it should be confirmed that observation until 12 weeks is not related to decreased os as in the present study . 
 as our data showed no difference between etpd and ltpd  confirmation after serial observations would be reasonable rather than deciding early from a little information . 
 correlation between mgmt methylation and pspd  and association with improved os has been reported by brandes et al.1 ) . in our study  the survival graph comparing mgmt methylated / unmethylated group showed difference but not statistically significant . 
 may reflect increased bbb permeability  administration of bevacizumab under misdiagnosis of true progression normalizes a leaky vasculature and therefore may show a "" response""25 ) . 
 it is highly persuasive but only a hypothesis and needs further examination in the future study . in the present study 
 the regression of in - field recurrence occurred 1 month after administration of the drug  and remained stable disease for 11 months . 
 however  as we had impression of both possibilities  true progression vs. treatment related change  we still can not rule out late pspd in this case . 
 counting such cases as the treatment effect may result in a falsely high response rate to an anti - angiogenic agent . as we can not perform pathologic confirmation in every suspected recurrence  pspd and psr should not be considered separately . regarding psr  conflicting views 
 as mentioned earlier  a strikingly high response rate and progression - free survival ( pfs ) does not result in increased os ; thus  doubt exists regarding whether bevacizumab has an antitumor effect . in a pooled analysis by norden et al.18 ) 
  a statistically significant increase was found in pfs of patients receiving bevacizumab ; however  os demonstrated no statistically significant difference . in the same context 
 bevacizumab causes adverse effects such as intracranial hemorrhage  thromboembolic events  and proteinuria7 ) . in a phase ii study of bevacizumab and cpt-11 in recurrent malignant glioma  4 of 32 ( 13% ) 
 patients had a thromboembolic event and two of them died of toxicity / neurologic deterioration27 ) . 
 . one possible advantage of bevacizumab is considered to be reduction of corticosteroid use3 )  but paradoxically it can cause dependency on bevacizumab  which is one of the most expensive drugs . additionally  bevacizumab can cause vegf - independent mechanisms of progression in the heavily treated patients18 ) . 
 furthermore  as glioblastoma is known to be associated with a high risk of thromboembolism  anti - coagulation would be needed to prevent severe complication19 ) . 
 however  not every patient planning to be administered bevacizumab can receive prophylaxis  and thus a positive effect for survival may be countervailed . 
 this life - threatening toxicity can not be overlooked  and costs and benefits must be considered . 
 one of the limitations of the current study is showing high os than other reported data  and this may be due to censored data  as 9 of the patients were unavailable for follow - up9 ) . when recurrence was suspected  salvage treatment varied among patients because until now there is no standard chemotherapy regimen in the management of high - grade glioma . 
 although small - sized and retrospective in nature  the present study suggests methodology and evidence for the safety of postponed treatment of recurrent high - grade glioma until 12 weeks after termination of crt and shows clinical features of psr  raising a question about the true effect of bevacizumab . 
 initiating a further treatment plan after 12 weeks as recommended by rano does not lead to loss of overall survival . 
 additionally  in recurrent high - grade glioma  bevacizumab must be administered with caution in consideration of pspd and psr . however  mri with gadolinium enhancement alone is not sufficient to characterize tumor response or growth . 
 in addition to clinical correlation with adequate duration of follow - up and histopathologic validation  further studies regarding additional physiologic imaging modalities are required for accurate evaluation of tumor response .","


1) Abstract: This study evaluated pseudoprogression and pseudoresponse in patients with high-grade glioma who received radiation therapy and anti-angiogenic therapy. Results showed 38% of patients had radiologic progression, but salvage bevacizumab therapy resulted in radiological response in 50% of patients.

2) Research and Discussion: A total of 55 patients were treated with radiation therapy and concurrent temozolomide, followed by adjuvant temozolomide. Salvage bevacizumab therapy was used for radiologic progression and showed positive results. MRI performed every 2 months for patients treated with the bevacizumab-containing regimen.

3) Results and Conclusion: Of 55 patients, 16 (29%) showed progression on MRI after treatment (ETPD), while 7 of 34 patients showed later progression (LTPD). No significant survival difference between the groups. 50% of patients showed response with bevacizumab therapy, but 4 exhibited fast progression after stopping the drug. 12 weeks after treatment could be the ideal time to determine pseudoresponse."
"the fontan procedure is used to separate the systemic and pulmonary circulations in patients with various forms of functionally univentricular hearts . in the fontan circulation 
  systemic venous return is sent to the pulmonary arteries without passage through a ventricle . 
 the fontan procedure can result in various late complications  including central venous hypertension  diminished oxygen delivery  reduced cardiac output  venous thrombosis  and arrhythmia ( 12 ) . 
 these complications caused by central venous hypertension lead to parenchymal injury  fibrosis  and cirrhosis of the liver ( 23 ) . 
 cardiac cirrhosis is a serious late complication of congenital heart disease and can cause hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) ( 45 ) . 
 however  the prevalence and risk factors of cirrhotic changes and hccs have not been clearly identified . 
 furthermore  non - invasive diagnostic tools for hepatic fibrosis and the management of hcc in patients after undergoing the fontan procedure have not yet been clearly established . 
 a 29-year - old woman with a history of a univentricular heart had undergone a fontan operation 10 years of age . 
 she was followed - up at the department of pediatric cardiology in our hospital  and regularly underwent blood examinations without alpha - fetoprotein ( afp ) at 2- or 3-month intervals . 
 a routine follow - up day  she experienced slight abdominal discomfort and received abdominal ultrasonography ( us ) . 
 b - mode conventional us showed a 15 mm hypoechoic mass in liver segment 4 ( s4 ) ( fig . 
 1a )  and an 18 mm hyperechoic mass in liver segment 2 ( s2 ) ( fig . 
 furthermore  the liver parenchyma had a coarsened appearance consistent with cirrhosis  and ascites and splenomegaly were observed ( fig . 
 b - mode conventional ultrasonography showed a 15 mm hypoechoic mass in liver segment 4 ( s4 ) ( a )  the liver parenchyma had a coarsened appearance consistent with cirrhosis  and ascites and splenomegaly were observed ( b  c).ceus using sonazoid showed a homogeneously enhanced mass in the arterial dominant phase ( d )  a hypoechoic mass relative to the adjacent liver parenchyma during the portal dominant phase ( e )  and a contrast defect with a clear border in the postvascular phase ( f ) . 
 b - mode conventional ultrasonography showed an 18 mm hyperechoic mass in liver segment 2 ( s2 ) ( a ) ; and ceus showed a homogeneously enhanced mass in the arterial dominant phase ( b )  isoechoic mass relative to the adjacent liver parenchyma during the portal dominant phase ( c )  and no defects in the postvascular phase ( d ) . 
 we next performed contrast - enhanced us ( ceus ) using a bolus injection of 0.015 ml / kg sonazoid ( perfluorobutane ; daiichi - sankyo  tokyo  japan ) . 
 the mass lesion in s4 was homogeneously enhanced in the arterial dominant phase ( from 10 to 30 seconds ) ( fig . 
 the lesion became progressively hypoechoic relative to the adjacent liver parenchyma during the portal dominant phase ( from 30 to 120 seconds ) ( fig . 
 1e )  and provided a contrast defect with a clear border in the postvascular phase ( 10 minutes later ) ( fig . 
 the mass lesion in s2 was homogeneously enhanced in the arterial dominant phase ( fig . 
 the lesion became isoechoic mass relative to the adjacent liver parenchyma during the portal dominant phase ( fig . 
 2c ) and provided no defects in the postvascular phase ( 10 minutes later ) ( fig . 
 we subsequently performed magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) with conventional t1-and t2-weighted imaging ( wi ) before and after contrast media administration  including diffusion imaging . 
 the contrast media used was hepatocyte - specific primovist [ gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid ( gd - eob - dtpa ) ; bayer schering pharma  berlin  germany ] . 
 there was radiographic evidence of liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension  including a nodular surface  a coarse texture  ascites  and splenomegaly on mri ( fig . 
 there was radiographic evidence of liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension  including a nodular surface  a coarse texture  ascites  and splenomegaly on mri ( a  b ) . 
 gd - eob - dtpa mri showed a 15 mm s4 mass with a moderately low intensity in t1-wi ( c )  moderately high intensity in t2-wi ( d )  moderately high intensity in diffusion ( e )  homogeneous arterial enhancement ( b  f )  and complete washout in the hepatobiliary phase ( g ) . 
 this imaging revealed a mass lesion in s4 with a moderately low intensity in t1-wi ( fig . 
 3b and f )  and washout in the portal phase at 70 seconds and interstitial phase at 180 seconds . at 20 minutes ( hepatobiliary phase ) after the contrast uptake the lesion showed washout ( fig . 
 in addition  mri imaging revealed a mass lesion in s2 with a moderately high intensity in t1-wi ( fig . 
 4a and e )  an isoenhancement relative to the adjacent liver parenchyma in the portal and interstitial phases  and a high intensity in the hepatobiliary phase ( fig . 
 gd - eob - dtpa mri showed an 18 mm s2 mass with a moderately high intensity in t1-wi ( b )  moderately low intensity in t2-wi ( c )  moderately low intensity in diffusion ( d )  homogeneous arterial enhancement ( a  e )  and high intensity in the hepatobiliary phase ( f ) . 
 her liver function was well preserved with the child - pugh classification a  and her international normalized ratio was low ( the patient was on warfarin for atrial arrhythmia ) . 
 other lab findings included a high afp level [ normal less than 40 nanograms / milliliter ( ng / ml ) ]  high lens culinaris agglutinin - reactive fraction of afp ( afp - l3 ) ( normal less than 10% )  low platelet count ( normal greater than 150000/microliter )  high hyaluronic acid ( normal less than 50 ng / ml )  and high type iv collagen 7s ( normal less than 6.0 ng / ml ) . 
 the patient had no other significant medical problems and no other risk factors for cirrhosis  as she expressed negativity for viral and autoimmune markers  no alcoholic consumption  no hepatotoxic drugs ( such as amiodarone )  and no metabolic factors such as diabetes mellitus  obesity ( her body mass index was 17.7 )  or fatty liver in us . following the reversal of her warfarin therapy  an ultrasound - guided needle biopsy of the s2 lesion was performed . 
 histological findings revealed that bridging fibrosis in the liver section  and the parenchymal cells did not display cellular or structural atypia ( fig .

 the parenchymal cells did not display cellular or structural atypia [ hematoxylin and eosin staining ( a )  and silver impregnation ( b ) with a low - power field ] . 
 the patient underwent a curative operation  involving partial hepatectomy of s4 in the liver . 
 macroscopically  sections of the specimen revealed a yellowish - white encapsulated solid tumor measuring 15 mm in size ( fig . 
 6a ) . a macroscopic appearance of the resected s4 specimen revealed a yellowish - white encapsulated solid tumor measuring 15 mm in size ( a ) . 
 microscopically  the growth pattern of the s4 liver tumor showed expansive growth with extracapsular invasions [ b  hematoxylin and eosin ( h&e ) staining with a low - power field ] . 
 tumor cells had an increased nuclear / cytoplasmic ratio  polymorphic  and chromatin - rich nuclei  and the pathological diagnosis was poorly differentiated hcc ( c  h&e staining with a high - power field ) . 
 the growth pattern of the liver tumor showed expansive growth with extracapsular invasions ( fig . 
 the tumor cells had an increased nuclear / cytoplasmic ratio  polymorphic  and chromatin - rich nuclei  and the pathological diagnosis was poorly differentiated hcc ( fig . 
 the non - cancerous area of the resected specimen revealed that bridging fibrosis was observed without fat deposition  and the patient was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis ( fig . 
 fibrosis was observed in both the portal and pericellular areas  the sinusoidal structure was maintained  but no signicant inflammation was observed ( fig . 
 the noncancerous area of the resected specimen revealed bridging fibrosis without fat deposition  and the patient was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis [ silver impregnation ( a ) ] . 
 fibrosis was observed in both the portal and pericellular areas  the sinusoidal structure was maintained  and signicant inammation was not seen [ silver impregnation ( b  c ) with a high - power field ] . 
 after discharge from the hospital  the patient was followed - up at 3-month intervals . at the 1-year follow - up  her afp level was 2.7 ng / ml  afp - l3 was less than 0.5%  and the tumor markers remained normal . 
 in the present case  there were no known etiological factors such as hepatitis viral infection  alcoholic liver disease  autoimmune liver diseases  autoimmune hepatitis  primary biliary cirrhosis  metabolic liver diseases [ such as non - alcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) ]  or medication with hepatotoxic drugs ( such as amiodarone ) . 
 moreover  significant hepatic inflammation or fat deposition was not seen as a result of processes such as hepatitis viral infection or nash . 
 on histology in the present case  hepatic sinusoidal fibrosis extending from centrilobular areas toward the portal tract without inflammation were observed . 
 schwarz et al . discussed that hepatic fibrosis after the fontan procedure was a mixed disease that affects both the portal and centrilobular areas in liver biopsy and autopsy specimens ( 67 ) . 
 sinusoidal fibrosis is believed to result from an increase in central venous pressure transmitted to hepatic cells that surround the central veins  because the extent of cirrhosis is strongly correlated with elevated hepatic venous pressures and a low cardiac index in patients after undergoing the fontan procedure ( 8) . 
 after fontan palliation  a significant liver disease can result in central venous congestion and hypoxia resulting from a low cardiac output  however  little is known regarding fibrogenic mechanisms independent of the inflammation - mediated pathway in congestive liver disease ( cld ) . in cld  
 mechanotransduction associated with stretching and compression of hepatic stellate cells may be a potent inducer of hepatic fibrosis ( 910 ) . using a newly characterized murine cld model  sinusoidal thrombosis and mechanical stretching of adjacent hepatic stellate cells caused by sinusoidal dilatation 
 was shown to induce the release of fibronectin by hepatic stellate cells  and both fibrin and stretching stimulated fibronectin fibril assembly through a 1-integrin and actin - dependent mechanism ( 11 ) . 
 in addition  hepatic complications after the fontan procedure are associated with the duration of follow - up ( 812 ) . 
 progression to cirrhosis may even be observed within 10 years after the initial fontan procedure ( 13 ) . in 34 patients with a median follow - up of 11.5 years after the fontan procedure 
  30% experienced abnormal transaminases  61% abnormal -gtp  32% abnormal bilirubin  and 58% coagulopathy ( 14 ) . 
 as compared to a duration of 0 - 5 years  the odds ratio of hepatic complications was 4.4 for a post - fontan duration of 11 - 15 years and 9.0 for a duration of 16 - 20 years  respectively ( 12 ) . 
 liver cirrhosis is a potential prerequisite for hcc  however  the prevalence and progression of cirrhotic changes in the fontan population have not been clearly identified . 
 non - invasive diagnostic tools for hepatic fibrosis are needed  because a liver biopsy  the golden standard for diagnosing liver cirrhosis  is difficult to perform in fontan patients due to prophylactic anticoagulation . 
 similar to the present case  a radiological assessment of liver fibrosis using various methods such as us  ct  or mri may be useful . 
 as shown in table 2  a recent pubmed search identified 12 cases of hccs among published reports . 
 the publications described the use of surgical resection  transcatheter arterial chemoembolization  radioembolization  local ablation  or sorafenib therapy ( 15 - 22 ) . 
 in previous reports  two patients were treated with surgical resection ( 2021 ) . for early stage 
 hcc  surgical resection provides curative treatment with a long - time survival  however  hepatectomy is rarely performed following the fontan procedure because it is difficult to detect early stage hccs . although the present patient did not receive periodic surveillance for hcc  such as us and afp  it is fortunate that early stage hcc was incidentally detected . 
 hcc detected after the onset of symptoms has a poor prognosis ( 5-year survival rate of 0 - 10% ) . 
 in contrast  early stage hccs detected by surveillance can be cured with both surgical resection and liver transplantation ( 5-year disease - free survival rate > 50% ) ( 23 ) . 
 f : female  m : male  nd : not described  tace : transarterial chemoembolization  tae : transarterial embolization thus  surveillance for hcc may be necessary in patients with cld who undergo the fontan procedure because cirrhosis is a high - risk factor for hcc . 
 however  the screening interval for liver disease after the fontan procedure has not yet been established . 
 surveillance is based on an ultrasound examination  and the recommended screening interval is 6 months according to the american association for the study of liver diseases ( aasld ) practice guidelines on the management of hcc ( 24 ) . 
 ( 25 )  all patients with high - risk risk factors for hcc are advised to undergo periodic surveillance with us and laboratory work ups  including afp and protein induced by vitamin k absence or antagonists - ii ( pivka - ii )  every 6 months . however  
 similar to the present case  pivka - ii is not useful in most patients after the fontan procedure because prophylactic antiplatelet with anticoagulation therapies  such as warfarin administration  are necessary to prevent thromboembolic events  which are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality ( 26 ) . following the fontan procedure  patients face a risk of hcc and require a lifelong follow - up with not only a pediatric cardiologist  but also a hepatologist experienced in the care of patients with liver cirrhosis . 
 we herein described a patient with hcc who was able to safely undergo liver resection following the fontan procedure under a preserved cardiac and hepatic function .

Abstract:
This case report presents a 29-year-old woman with incidental liver masses found during routine abdominal ultrasonography. Subsequent imaging and biopsies revealed a regenerative nodule and a poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, likely related to her prior Fontan procedure at 10 years of age.

Research and Discussion:
The presence of liver masses in Fontan patients is a known complication, likely due to chronic venous congestion and impaired hepatic function. This case highlights the importance of continued monitoring and evaluation of liver function in long-term Fontan survivors, as early detection and intervention may improve outcomes.

Results and Conclusion:
The incidental finding of liver masses in our patient led to further imaging and biopsies, resulting in a diagnosis of a regenerative nodule and a poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. These findings emphasize the need for regular surveillance in long-term Fontan patients and prompt treatment for any detected liver masses, which may improve overall outcomes."
"this case describes a young non - pregnant cat that presented with uterine prolapse in association with an unusual diffuse  polypoid  fibrosing perimetritis and parametritis . 
 no intra - abdominal complications were seen on ultrasound examination 3 months postsurgery . at the time of writing  
 uterine prolapse in the cat is relatively rare and usually associated with the periparturient period . 
 inflammatory polypoid perimetritis and parametritis have not previously been documented in cats  and in dogs have only been reported in association with the administration of oestrogenic compounds . 
 the polypoid inflammation affecting the uterus and parametrium may have contributed to increased laxity of the uterine ligaments and predisposed to the development of uterine prolapse . 
 uterine prolapse is rare in the queen  usually occurring after delivery of kittens or abortion . 
 we report uterine prolapse in a non - pregnant queen and in association with an unusual diffuse  polypoid  fibrosis of the perimetrium and parametrium . 
 the perimetrium ( syn uterine tunica serosa ) is equivalent to the visceral peritoneal lining . 
 it is composed of loose connective tissue containing nerves and smooth muscle cells covered by mesothelium . 
 it blends in with the broad ligaments of the uterus  which is also covered by mesothelium and contains a core of connective tissue  the parametrium . 
 while peritonitis in cats is frequently associated with feline infectious peritonitis  specific lesions unique to the perimetrium have not been documented . 
 a stray 6- to 7-month - old domestic shorthair queen  weighing 2.15 kg  was presented to the university veterinary clinic with uterine prolapse after being observed for several days prior to capture . on examination 
  both uterine horns were prolapsed  everted and swollen  with regions of hyperaemia  particularly towards the tips of the uterine horns . 
 no evidence of placental zoning or tissue necrosis  in particular gangrene  was noted ( figure 1 ) . 
 prolapsed and everted uterus following lavage which revealed swollen  hyperaemic and viable tissue clinical assessment revealed normal appetite and demeanour . 
 the vital parameters were within normal limits ( temperature 37.8c  respiratory rate 40 breaths / min  heart rate 140 beats / min ) . 
 the cat received hydromorphone hydrochloride injection ( hydromorphone ; west - ward pharmaceutical ) at 0.1 mg / kg iv q4h for pain management and to facilitate further examination . 
 initial haematological and blood biochemical evaluations revealed a markedly regenerative anaemia ( packed cell volume 24% [ reference interval ( ri ) 2545% ; erythrocytes 4.64  10/l [ ri 510  10/l ]  reticulocytes 375.84  10 /l [ ri 040  10/l ] ) and a neutrophilic leukocytosis with mild toxic changes ( leukocytes 37.72  10/l [ ri 5.519.5  10/l ] ; neutrophils 25.3  10/l [ ri 2.512.5  10/l ] ) . 
 blood biochemistry showed a mild hyperkalaemia ( 6.0 mmol / l [ ri 3.75.8 mmol / l ] ) and mild hypoglycaemia ( 66 mg / dl [ ri 70150 mg / dl ] ) . 
 oestrogen plasma concentrations were retrospectively evaluated at 25.7 pg / ml ( ri 1540 pg / ml ) . 
 intravenous crystalloid fluid solution ( plasmalyte ; travenol laboratories ) was administered to correct an estimated 8% dehydration deficit and maintenance requirement over 12 h. antibiotic therapy consisting of intravenous cefazolin sodium ( cefazolin for injection ; west - ward pharmaceutical ) at a dose rate of 22 mg / kg iv q8h was also administered . 
 attempts at reducing the uterus were again unsuccessful so an internal ovariectomy and external hysterectomy were performed . 
 the ovarian pedicles were transfixed and ligated prior to transection and before manipulating the uterine body further . 
 the everted uterus was circumferentially ligated distal to the cervix ( approximately 5 cm away from the vulva ) and transected . 
 the remaining uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity . from within the abdominal cavity  
 the serosa of uterine body was noted to be diffusely thickened by multiple - to - coalescing white villous projections ( figure 2 ) . 
 formalin - fixed perimetrial surface of uterine body revealing diffuse - to - coalescing polypoid lesions there was a small amount of mildly flocculent abdominal fluid present . 
 the cat recovered uneventfully and follow - up examinations in a 6 month period  including ultrasound at 3 months postsurgery  detected no abdominal abnormalities . 
 microscopic examination of the uterine body confirmed the presence of multiple nodular perimetrial proliferations of moderately loose connective tissue forming irregular polyps or plaques blending into the myometrium ( figures 3 and 4 ) . 
 most polyps contained multifocal randomly distributed lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrations  and regions of neovascularisation . 
 polyps were covered by a combination of normal  attenuated and moderately swollen mesothelial cells . at sites of mesothelial cell loss  
 the stratum vascularis was moderately oedematous containing both congested medium - to - large size blood vessels and dilated lymphatics . 
 endometrium and uterine epithelium appeared unremarkable with a low glandular content  intact mucosal epithelium and minimal - to - no inflammatory cell infiltrations . 
 the lesion was characterised as a diffuse  chronic  polypoid  fibrotic perimetritis and parametritis . 
 cross - section of uterine body ( u ) revealing multiple polypoid perimetrial projections ( p ) ( haematoxylin and eosin ) polypoid structures blending with myometrium and containing ( a ) foci of angiogenesis and ( b ) regions of active fibroplasia ( haematoxylin and eosin ) 
 uterine prolapse has rarely been documented in cats  with individual case reports citing complete or unilateral uterine prolapse with or without uterine mucosal eversion . 
 the majority have occurred in association with the periparturient period  one of which was proposed to be associated with oestrus . 
 furthermore  a novel lesion inducing extensive perimetrial fibrosis  not previously reported in cats  was noted and could potentially be implicated as the cause . 
 however  other factors have been suggested including uterine atony or excessive abdominal contractions  including tenesmus . for the uterus to prolapse 
 there is a requirement for laxity  stretching or rupture of uterine ligaments  and for patency of the cervix . 
 laxity of the uterine ligaments can occur due to repeated pregnancy  and changes in progesterone  oestrogen and relaxin concentrations near parturition . 
 cervical patency occurs at two time points  oestrus ( with or without ovulation ) and at parturition . based on the absence of any newborn animals  
 no mammary development and no histopathological features to suggest recent pregnancy  such as placental zoning  recent uterine haemorrhage  inflammation and endometrial regeneration  it is unlikely this animal was in advanced pregnancy or had aborted . 
 it was not possible  however  to establish if this animal had recently been in oestrus as oestrogen levels  which were within normal limits  can vary significantly over short periods of time within the oestrus cycle . while the uterus was large  
 this latter feature could potentially have contributed to uterine prolapse in at least two ways  namely by inducing ligament laxity and/or acting as a caudal abdominal irritant inducing abdominal contractions or tenesmus . while an active lesion 
  the extent of mature fibrous tissue would suggest the presence of this lesion in advance of the uterine prolapse . 
 perimetrial inflammation can co - exist as part of peritonitis  and in cats peritonitis is frequently associated with feline infectious peritonitis or primary bacterial septic peritonitis where bacteroides species and fusobacterium species are mainly isolated . however  such lesions do not manifest as polypoid fibrous proliferations . 
 similar proliferative fibrotic lesions focused on the perimetrium have been described in dogs associated with experimental stilboestrol ( synthetic oestrogen ) administration . 
 perimetrial papillae consisting of proliferations of mesothelial cells and subjacent connective tissue were documented in ovariectomised dogs administered stilboestrol over 150350 days . 
 similar to the present case  such lesions were confined to genital organ serosal surfaces  including the broad ligament . 
 such perimetrial lesions were also noted in entire female dogs when administered synthetic oestrogens in association with other lesions  including oestrogen - induced renal fibrosis . 
 proposed mechanisms of regional fibrous proliferations suggested involvement of stromal oestrogen receptors . while the cat develops oestrogen - associated pathology  similar perimetrial pathology has not been documented in association with oestrogen . 
 the ovaries were not submitted for histopathological evaluation to eliminate ovarian pathology definitively ( cystic follicular disease  ovarian neoplasia ) as a potential source of hyperoestrogenism . 
 cats in the tropics are likely to cycle continuously and it is recognised that some unmated cats may appear to be in persistent oestrous  owing to a relatively short interoestrous period and thus remain in a physiological hyperoestrogenic state . it was also unlikely this cat had access to exogenous oestrogenic compounds . in humans  more generalised intra - abdominal  
 fibrosing lesions of peritoneal surfaces ( intra - abdominal fibromatosis ) are described in mesenteric  retroperitoneal and pelvic locations . 
 sclerosing peritonitis has been noted after surgery  following long - term continuous peritoneal dialysis and also as a side effect of utilising beta - blockers . 
 the pathogenesis of these lesions is thought to be the result of a delayed healing response due to loss of mesothelial cells or continued serosal irritation . 
 however  the appearance is not described as polypoid and ranges through a spectrum of gross changes in the appearance of the visceral peritoneum  from opacification of the serosa ( disorganised collagen fibres and stromal expansion ) through to  tanned peritoneum ( hyalinised collagen  fibrin and vessel sclerosis )  which can progress to a stage where the viscera are palpably stiffened ( mural fibrosis ) . 
 the unique perimetritis and parametritis observed in this case highlights an additional potential cause of uterine prolapse and warrants that  in cases of uterine prolapse in non - pregnant animals  perimetrial and parametrial tissue should be evaluated for varying degrees of inflammation .","

Abstract:
This case presents a rare occurrence of uterine prolapse in a young non-pregnant cat, associated with an inflammatory polypoid perimetritis and parametritis. After ovariohysterectomy, the cat fully recovered with no complications observed on ultrasound examination. This case highlights the potential role of inflammatory changes in causing uterine prolapse in felines.

Research and Discussion:
Uterine prolapse in cats is usually seen during the periparturient period. However, in this case, the presence of an unusual diffuse, polypoid, fibrosing perimetritis and parametritis may have contributed to the prolapse. These conditions have not been previously documented in cats and have only been reported in dogs after the administration of oestrogenic compounds. The inflamed tissues may have increased the laxity of uterine ligaments, making the cat more susceptible to prolapse.

Results and Conclusion:
The cat in this case fully recovered after ovariohysterectomy, with no complications observed on ultrasound examination. This highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and treatment of uterine prolapse in cats. The presence of inflammatory polypoid perimetritis and parametritis in this case suggests their potential role in causing uterine prolapse in felines. Further research is needed to better understand the etiology and management of this condition in cats."
"some gram - negative bacteria could express extensive multidrug resistance and significantly increase the rate of nosocomial infections in the hospital ( 1 ) . among these bacteria 
 previous studies showed that a. baumannii was already an emerging pathogen in the respiratory tract  wounds  blood and urine ( 3 ) . 
 since the strains of a. baumannii were usually resistant to most available drugs  except colistin and tigecycline  they would be very sticky when detected on a patient . 
 therefore  the urgent need to study the epidemiology of resistance  surveillance and control measures for a. baumannii in hospital infections was warned ( 4 ) . 
 acinetobacter baumannii could be found in diverse sources such as food  water and soils . 
 acinetobacter baumannii strains are able to survive for a long time even on a dry surface and some of them could toughly attach to human epithelial cells through fimbriae or side chains ( 5 ) . 
 these characteristics indicate that a. baumannii could easily spread via surface  air or any other possible pathways . 
 moreover  many studies showed that in a certain section of the hospital there was only one type of a. baumannii ( 1  6 ) . 
 the sources of the harmful a. baumannii may be found by analyzing the molecular epidemiology of the strain in time . however  there are not enough studies on this subject . on the other hand  although physicians and surgeons all reported the threat of a. baumannii  most of the raised problems were from internal medicine or icu . 
 the differences may be caused by the selective pressure from indiscriminate use of broad - spectrum antibiotics in different clinical departments ( 7 ) . 
 analysis may lead to a new explanation for the formation and spread of carbapenem - resistant acinetobacter baumannii ( crab ) or carbapenem - susceptible acinetobacter baumannii ( csab ) ( 8) . 
 however  by now few researches compared the differences of the distribution in different departments . 
 the current study aimed to analyze the distribution of certain types of a. baumannii in clinical departments . 
 authors tried to figure out the roles of the antibiotic - resistant genes and the therapies for the diseases in different departments with spread of crab and csab .

 a disk was impregnated with the antibiotic - compounds and then placed on the plate . 
 concentrations of the compound were the highest next to the disk and decreased as distance from the disk increased . 
 once the compound was effective against the bacteria at a certain concentration  no colonies would grow at the point where the concentration in the agar was greater than the effective concentration  i. e. the inhibition zone . 
 pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27853 and escherichia coli atcc25922 were used as the quality - control isolates ( 5 ) .

 acinetobacter baumannii is widely distributed in the environment  human body and surfaces ( 12 ) . 
 studies show that growing numbers of carbapenem - resistant pathogenic bacteria  such as crab are now appearing . 
 the prevention and treatment of crab is an urgent issue to control nosocomial infections ( 13 - 15 ) . in the current study  
 all strains of a. baumannii were resistant to antibiotics in different degrees ( table 4 ) . 
 in fact  it is a common phenomenon in hospitals in china ( 9 ) . 
 moreover  it was found that distribution of the crab isolates were related to the wards where they came from ( table 5 ) . 
 isolates from icu and department of respiratory medicine had higher levels of antibiotic - resistance than the strains from the surgery department . 
 it may be due to the long - term use of antibiotics in the former wards ( 16 - 18 ) . 
 this finding showed that the distribution of crab may be affected by the therapeutic methods . 
 besides  authors further studied the types of the isolates in the air and hands of the doctors and nurses in the wards . 
 it was found that in icu only st208 existed ; while in department of burn and plastic surgery only st218 was detected . 
 considering the fact that these two departments were physically separated  it was speculated that the two different isolates may have different origins and they were separated by the spatial distance and were only epidemic in each section . 
 currently  techniques for molecular cloning and detection are widely used to study the types of certain isolates ( 3  10 - 13 ) . in the current study a new technique  mlst  was used . 
 mlst classified the strains according to the results of accurate detection of the sequences of nucleic acid from the isolates ( 19 ) . 
 two isolates  st208 and st218 were found in the hospital  and each one had its own  territory 
 this finding showed that a certain kind of bacteria would be dominant in a certain section . 
 the existence of anti - carbapenemase enzymes was the key factor to the prevalence of multidrug - resistant bacteria ( 20 - 22 ) . 
 previous reports showed that five types of anti - carbapenemase enzymes  oxa-23  51  sim  imp and spm could be detected in crab ( 23 ) . 
 the current study found that oxa-23 and 51 were the most prevalent genes in the hospital . 
 since these antibiotic resistance inducing genes were all expressed in plasmid  their distribution was determined by gene mutation and combined effect of the antibiotics used in a certain place . 
 thus  the final results of the distribution are the  natural selection  in the certain therapeutic milieu in the hospital . 
 identification of the types and genes of the isolates in a certain ward would be important to restrict the prevalence . 
 moreover  although many microbiologists believe that the nuclear - dna is not related to the plasmid - dna in bacteria  the current study findings indicated that in st208 there were more chances for the existence of oxa-23  51 ( table 8) . the fact revealed that there might be certain connections between the nuclear - gene types and the appearance of plasmid genes . 
  there may be different isolates of ab in different wards since these departments were physically separated . 
 the levels of antibiotic - resistance were also quite different in the isolates from different locations of the human body . 
 species isolates from blood culture had the highest level of antibiotic - resistance . st208 and the st218 were the epidemic isolates of ab  their abilities of drug - resistance were due to the existence of oxa-23  oxa-51  intl 1 and qace1-sul 1 . 
 hospital managers should take measures to supervise the epidemiology and types of the crab isolates . 
 the study of the molecular epidemiology of these isolates from different wards and specimens were significantly important . besides  further studies on the connections between the plasmid gene expression and types of the isolates are required ."," and thank you

1) Abstract: This study investigated the genetic characteristics and resistance mechanisms of Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from clinical samples in Shaoxing People's Hospital in China. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and Kirby-Bauer testing were used to characterize the isolates and evaluate antibiotic resistance. The results showed two main bacterial types, ST208 and ST218, and the presence of multidrug resistance genes.

2) Research and Discussion: The study focused on A. baumannii, the most prevalent strain in hospitals, and its distribution and antibiotic resistance in different clinical departments. MLST and Kirby-Bauer testing were used to analyze the isolates, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect resistance-inducing genes. Overall, the results showed the presence of two predominant bacterial types and the high prevalence of carbapenem resistance among A. baumannii strains.

3) Results and Conclusion: The study found that A. baumannii ST208 and ST218 were the main types isolated from clinical samples at Shaoxing People's Hospital. Additionally, carbapenem resistance was prevalent in these isolates, and the most commonly observed resistance genes were OXA-23, OXA-51, INT-1, and qacE1-sul1. The distribution of A. baumannii also varied among different clinical departments and sample types. These findings suggest the need for further research and efforts to combat A. baumannii infections in hospital settings."
"high phosphorus ( p ) intake is known as one of the risk factors for impaired bone health . 
 several researchers have investigated the adverse effects of a high p diet on bone metabolism . in human adults  
 a diet containing p additives increases urinary hydroxyproline excretion  a bone resorption marker . in growing male rats  
 elevation in parathyroid hormone ( pth ) secretion is considered one of the mechanisms by which a high p diet impairs bone metabolism . 
 pth stimulates osteoblasts  which produce mediators of osteoclastic bone resorption such as macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( m - csf )  interleukin-6 ( il-6 )  or receptor activator of nf-b ligand ( rankl ) [ 46 ] . 
 we previously reported that a high p diet increased rankl mrna expression and the osteoclast number in rats . 
 it could therefore be deduced that high p diet - induced elevated pth secretion leads to an increase in rankl expression  which enhances osteoclastic bone resorption . 
 overton and basu suggested that bone loss occurs with increasing age at a rate of approximately 1% per year averaged over the age range of 2976  y . in a previous mouse study by ferguson et al .  bone mass and mechanical properties approached mature levels by 12 weeks of age while age - related osteopenia was observed after 42 weeks of age . 
 we previously reported the effects of a high p diet on mechanical properties of the femur in 4-  12-  24-  and 80-week - old mice . 
 the results showed that a high p diet decreased the breaking force of the femur in 80-week - old mice and the stiffness of the femur in 24- and 80-week - old mice . 
 we also found that a high p diet increased serum pth concentration in 12-  24-  and 80-week - old mice  and 80-week - old mice had a higher serum pth concentration than mice at other ages . 
 therefore  it was thought that a high p diet strongly influences aged mice in terms of pth response . 
 the purpose of this study was to clarify the mechanism by which a high p diet affects bone metabolism in older mice . 
 we assessed the changes in bone metabolism in young and aged mice fed a high p diet by measuring the mrna expression of bone metabolism mediators using real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) . 
 the mice were maintained in accordance with the university guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals . 
 the experimental diets were based on the ain-93 g diet ( table 1 ) . a control diet containing 0.3% p and a high p diet containing 1.2% 
 twenty - four 10-week - old ddy male mice were purchased from slc ( shizuoka  japan ) and housed individually in stainless cages in a room maintained at 22c with a 12-hour light / dark cycle . 
 half of the mice were fed a commercial diet ( ce-2  clea japan  tokyo  japan ) until 78 weeks of age . 
 after the acclimatization period  12 young ( 12-week - old ) and 12 aged ( 80-week - old ) mice were randomly divided into two experimental groups and fed the control diet or the high p diet for 4 weeks . they were given free access to the diets and distilled water . 
 their urine samples were collected during the 5 days prior to euthanasia for the further analyses . at the end of the experimental period 
  all mice were euthanized under anesthesia and blood  bone  and duodenum samples were collected for analyses . 
 the serum ca level was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry ( hitachi a-2000 ; hitachi  tokyo  japan ) according to the method of gimblet et al . . 
 the serum p level was analyzed by colorimetry using phospha c - test wako ( wako pure chemical industries  osaka  japan ) . 
 serum pth concentration was measured using the mouse intact pth enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) kit ( alpco  nh  usa ) . 
 serum intact osteocalcin ( oc ) concentration was measured using the mouse osteocalcin eia kit ( biomedical technologies  ma  usa ) . 
 urinary c - terminal telopeptide of type i collagen ( ctx ) level was measured using ratlaps eia kit ( immunodiagnostic systems  boldon  uk ) . 
 urinary creatinine level was measured using the jaffe reaction  as described by lustgarten and wenk . 
 total rna was isolated from the homogenized femurs or duodenum by using trizol reagent ( life technologies  ca  usa ) according to the manufacturer 's specifications . 
 the amount and purity of the rna were assessed using a nanodrop 2000c ( thermo fisher scientific  ma  usa ) . 
 complementary dna ( cdna ) was synthesized using the high - capacity rna - to - cdna kit ( applied biosystems  ca  usa ) . for real - time pcr 
  the reaction mixture was prepared using the taqman gene expression master mix ( applied biosystems ) with taqman gene expression assays ( applied biosystems ) for mouse pth receptor ( assay i d : mm00441046_m1 )  mouse rankl ( assay i d : mm00441906_m1 )  mouse osteoprotegerin ( opg ) ( assay i d : mm01205928_m1 )  mouse tartrate resistant acid phosphatase ( trap ) ( assay i d : mm00475698_m1 )  mouse runt related transcription factor 2 ( runx2 ) ( assay i d : mm00501580_m1 )  mouse osterix ( assay i d : mm04209856_m1 )  mouse alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) ( assay i d : mm00475834_m1 )  mouse osteopontin ( opn ) ( assay i d : mm00436767_m1 )  mouse oc ( assay i d : mm03413826_mh )  mouse type i collagen ( col1a1 ) ( assay i d : mm00801666_g1 )  mouse transient receptor potential vanilloid type 6 ( trpv6 ) ( assay i d : mm00499069_m1 )  mouse calbindin - d9k ( assay i d : mm00486654_m1 )  mouse plasma membrane ca - atpase 1b ( pmca1b ) ( assay i d : mm01245805_m1 )  and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( gapdh ) ( assay i d : mm99999915_g1 ) . 
 real - time pcr was performed using a stepone real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems ) . 
 the value of the young mice fed the control diet was considered to be 1.00 . 
 after two - way analysis of variance ( anova )  fisher 's protected least significant difference ( plsd ) test was used to determine significant differences among the groups . 
 in both young and aged mice  there was no significant difference in the initial body weight between mice fed the control and high p diets ( table 2 ) . 
 the initial body weight of aged mice was significantly higher than that of young mice . 
 there were no significant differences in serum ca and p concentrations among the groups ( table 2 ) . in both young and aged mice  
 although there was no significant difference in serum pth concentration between young and aged mice fed the control diet  serum pth concentration was significantly higher in aged mice than in young mice fed the high p diet . in both young and aged mice  
 the high p diet significantly increased serum oc concentration ( table 2 ) . in mice fed both 
 the control and high p diets  serum oc concentration was significantly lower in aged mice than in young mice . in both young and aged mice  
 although there was no significant difference in urinary excretion of ctx between young and aged mice fed the control diet  urinary excretion of ctx was significantly lower in aged mice than in young mice fed the high p diet . in both young and aged mice  the high p diet significantly increased mrna expression of pth receptor  rankl  trap  runx2  osterix  alp  opn  oc  and col1a1 ( figure 1 ) compared to the control diet . in mice 
 fed the control and high p diets  mrna expression of pth receptor  rankl  trap  runx2  osterix  alp  opn  oc  and col1a1 was significantly lower in aged mice than in young mice . 
 the high p diet significantly increased rankl / opg ratio in aged mice but did not in young mice . in both young and aged mice  
 high p diet significantly increased mrna expression of trpv6  cabp9k  and pmca1b ( figure 2 ) compared to the control diet . in mice 
 fed the control and high p diets  mrna expression of trpv6 and cabp9k was significantly lower in aged mice than in young mice . 
 in humans  bone loss occurs with increasing age at a rate of approximately 1% per year averaged over the ages of 2976 years . 
 therefore  aging is one of the risk factors for bone loss . in a previous mouse study  
 bone mass and mechanical properties were shown to approach mature levels by 12 weeks of age  and age - related osteopenia was observed after 42 weeks . in this study  we investigated bone metabolism by measuring markers of bone formation and resorption  serum oc concentration  and urinary ctx excretion . 
 serum oc concentration was significantly lower in aged mice than in young mice fed the control diet  whereas there is no difference in urinary excretion of ctx between young and aged mice fed the control diet . 
 these results showed that aged mice present a decrease in bone formation  and it appears that the balance between bone formation and resorption may be disrupted in aged mice . 
 bone formation is mediated by osteoblasts . using gene - deficient mouse models  runx2 and osterix 
 were shown to be essential transcription factors for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation [ 15  16 ] . in this study  
 runx2 and osterix mrna expression were significantly lower in aged mice than in young mice . 
 these results suggest that aging leads to a reduction in osteoblast differentiation and that runx2 and osterix mrna expression changes are associated with a decrease in bone formation in aged mice . 
 consequently  decreases in mrna expression of alp and bone matrix proteins such as opn  oc  and col1a1 also occurred in aged mice . 
 ikeda et al . showed that the mrna expression of opn  oc  and col1a1 decreased in both cortical and trabecular bones in aged rats compared to young animals . 
 in addition  cao et al . reported that alp and col1a1 expression declined in aged mice compared to young mice . 
 thus  aging results in a decrease in bone formation with declined osteoblast - related gene expression . with regard to bone resorption 
  this study showed that rankl and trap mrna expression were decreased in aged mice compared to young mice  despite unchanging serum pth concentration . 
 since pth stimulates rankl  the result of rankl mrna expression seems to contradict that of serum pth concentration . 
 however  pth receptor mrna expression was decreased in aged mice compared to young mice in this study . 
 this result suggested that pth action was suppressed  which decreased rankl mrna expression in aged mice . 
 though urinary excretion of ctx was unchanged  expression of bone resorption - rerated genes was decreased in aged mice compared to young mice . 
 however  it is generally known that age - related increase in serum pth contributes to the increase in bone resorption . 
 therefore  results of serum pth concentration and bone resorption between young and aged mice in this study are contradictory . 
 further studies with the increase in number of mice per group are needed to address these discrepancies . 
 a decline in intestinal ca absorption is also one of the causes of age - related bone loss . 
 the transcellular ca pathway  which is affected by 125-dihydroxyvitamin d ( 125(oh)2d )  has been proposed to involve ca entry via trpv6  intracellular diffusion of ca by calbindin - d9k  and basolateral extrusion of ca by pmca1b . in this study  
 trpv6 and calbindin - d9k mrna expression in the duodenum were decreased in aged mice compared to young mice . 
 demonstrated that plasma 125(oh)2d  duodenal calbindin d protein  and ca absorption decreased with age in rats . from this study 
 therefore  a decrease in serum 125(oh)2d might reflect our results on trpv6 and calbindin - d9k mrna expression . 
 many studies have reported that high p intake induces an increase in serum pth concentration in humans [ 1  23 ] and animals [ 2  3  24 ] . in this study  
 the high p diet increased serum pth concentration in both young and aged mice and was greater in aged mice than in young mice fed the high p diet . 
 similar to our previous study  these results suggest that the response to a high p diet in terms of pth secretion might be different and greater with aging . 
 kidney function decreases with age  and declining kidney function causes an increase in pth secretion . 
 . therefore  the combination of aging and high p diet might be one of the reasons that higher serum pth concentration was observed in aged mice fed the high p diet . 
 we previously reported that a high p diet increased rankl mrna expression and bone resorption in growing rats . 
 therefore  it was suggested that elevated pth secretion induced by the high p diet led to an increase in rankl expression  which increased bone resorption . in this study  
 the high p diet significantly increased urinary excretion of ctx in both young and aged mice . 
 regarding mrna expression of bone resorption - related molecules in the femora  the high p diet significantly increased rankl and trap mrna expressions in both young and aged mice . 
 rankl actions are inhibited by opg  which acts as a decoy receptor by blocking rankl binding to its receptor . in this study  
 the high p diet significantly increased the rankl / opg ratio in aged mice  whereas the ratio was unchanged in young mice . 
 many reports have supported the assertion that the increase in rankl / opg ratio promotes osteoclastogenesis  accelerates bone resorption  and induces bone loss . 
 our previous study showed that a high p diet decreased the breaking force and stiffness of the femur in aged mice compared to young mice . 
 our findings show that the high p diet in the aged mice leads to increased pth secretion and consequent increases in the rankl / opg ratio accelerating osteoclastogenesis . 
 previous studies showed that pth regulates runx2 and osterix mrna expression [ 30  31 ] . in this study  the high p diet significantly increased serum oc concentration and mrna expression of runx2  osterix  alp  opn  oc  and col1a1 in both young and aged mice . from the results of bone resorption and formation markers  high bone turnover with resorption exceeding formation 
 since high bone turnover is a risk factor for bone fracture and osteoporosis  a high p diet might be a risk factor for bone loss not only in young mice but also in aged mice . 
 pth secretion might reflect a decrease in ca absorption in the high p diet group . 
 although the mechanism underlying the high p diet - induced decreased ca absorption remains unknown  it is thought that the formation of insoluble ca and p salts in the intestinal lumen is an important factor . 
 our previous study also showed that high p diet decreased ca absorption in female rats . 
 while we did not evaluate ca absorption in this study  it is possible to estimate the decrease in ca absorption by high p diet in young and aged mice . 
 however  this study showed that the high p diet significantly increased mrna expression of trpv6  cabp9k  and pmca1b in both young and aged mice . 
 previous study demonstrated that ca restriction during lactation stimulated ca - binding protein and active ca transport in jejunum and ileum . 
 furthermore  ca deficient diet resulted in an increase in duodenal pmca mrna in chickens . 
 these studies suggested that 125(oh)2d - regulated ca transporters might be stimulated by low ca status in the intestinal lumen . 
 thus  a decrease in soluble ca induced by high p diet might lead to trpv6  cabp9k  and pmca1b mrna expression  and these increases in 125(oh)2d - regulated gene expression seem to compensate for a decrease in ca absorption by the high p diet . in brief  our results suggest that high p diet accelerates the transcellular ca pathway  though absorbed amount of ca was insufficient to maintain serum pth concentration . 
 it is known that fibroblast growth factor 23 ( fgf23 ) and 125(oh)2d as well as pth are key factors for ca and p metabolism . 
 therefore  measuring serum fgf23 and 125(oh)2d is important to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which high p diet changes ca and p metabolism  and further studies are needed to clarify the details . 
 in conclusion  we demonstrated that the high p diet increased bone metabolism - related gene expression in both young and aged mice . 
 furthermore  the high p diet affected pth secretion differently in young and aged mice  leading to an increase in the rankl / opg mrna ratio in aged mice .","

1) Abstract: The effects of a high phosphorus diet on bone metabolism-related gene expression were studied in young and aged mice. The high phosphorus diet significantly increased serum parathyroid hormone levels and receptor activator of NF-B ligand mRNA expression in the femur.

2) Research and Discussion: Twelve- and 80-week-old male mice were fed a diet containing either 0.3% or 1.2% phosphorus. After 4 weeks, serum parathyroid hormone levels were significantly higher in the high phosphorus group in both young and aged mice. The high phosphorus diet also increased calcium absorption-related gene expression in the duodenum.

3) Results and Conclusion: Regardless of age, the high phosphorus diet increased receptor activator of NF-B ligand mRNA expression in the femur, suggesting a potential impact on bone metabolism. Furthermore, the high phosphorus diet was also linked to increased secretion of parathyroid hormone, potentially leading to an increase in the rankl/opg mRNA ratio in aged mice. These findings highlight the impact of a high phosphorus diet on bone health and further research is needed to fully understand its effects."
"despite advancements in modern medical science and the health management industry  the 
 incidence of cerebral palsy ( cp ) continues to rise1 . 
 the most common features of cp are decreased muscle strength and 
 abnormal muscle tone2 . 
 cp sufferers lack 
 theability to generate enough force to maintain antigravity postural control  which result 
 in abnormal postures3 . 
 the development of movement and posture may be altered by 
 non - progressive damage to the brain and subsequent neurological impairments ( spasticity  
 muscle weakness  co - contractions and visual impairment)5 . 
 studies indicate that children and adults with both mild and severe 
 forms of cp have postural impairments678 . 
 the emergence of sitting postural control 
 in early infancy changes the way infants interact with the world . from the sitting position  
 looking  reaching  and interacting become functional and allow exploration that supports 
 learning and further development of motor skills . 
 therefore  independent sitting  defined as 
 not needing support from a caregiver or pillow while sitting  is one of the first 
 developmental goals for every child . 
 individual differences are present between children  
 and characteristic signs of developmental disorders during infancy are relatively 
 unspecific . therefore  why a specific child is not able to achieve sitting postural control 
 is not always clear . 
 one method of examining postural control in adults and children is to measure the center of 
 pressure ( cop ) at the base of support using a force platform during the task of remaining 
 upright . 
 cop has frequently been used to investigate postural control during standing by 
 young children who are healthy or have cp9  10 . 
 the purpose of this study was to 
 investigate the differences of the pressure distributions of the sitting postures of typical 
 developmental ( td ) children and children with cp . 
 twelve cp childrens were recruited from an outpatient rehabilitation clinic . they were 
 hemiparetic  had an mmse - k score above 2411  could maintain an independent sitting posture without support . 
 two of the cp children were 
 subsequently excluded because they refused to participate in this experiment . 
 all parents of the enrolled participants provided 
 their written informed consent to their children s participation prior to this experiment  
 in accordance with the ethical principles established in the declaration of helsinki . as a 
 result of the exclusion  
 this study used two 
 school chairs mounted on a force platform to assess the quiet - sitting pressure distribution 
 of the subjects . fsa seating assessment ( canada ) 
 the acquisition frequency was set at 5  hz . the stated working range of the 
 device is 0200 mmhg  with a resolution of 1 mmhg . 
 the system was also calibrated to assign 
 absolute pressure values to the digital output from an a / d converter connected to the 
 sensing pad . 
 this was done by applying a pressure distribution as similar to actual 
 conditions as possible . 
 then thus subjects sat on one of two school 
 chairs according to their height . 
 the chairs were those generally used in school . for 
 research purposes  this study used two basic school chair because students spend a long time 
 of day - to - day sitting on them . 
 one chair had a 40  cm floor to seat height  a 35  cm seat 
 depth  and a 32  cm seat width and is designed for 122.4133.5  cm height of subjects . 
 the 
 another had a 35  cm floor to seat height  a 38  cm seat depth  and a 35  cm seat width  and is 
 designed for 133.6152.7  cm height of subjects . 
 it has been used for the 
 posture symmetry in other study13 statistical analyses were performed using pasw 18.0 . 
 descriptive statistics were calculated 
 ( frequency  mean  standard deviation  range ) . 
 the mann - whitney u - tests and wilcoxon s signed 
 rank tests were used to analyze differences between the groups and differences in lesion 
 side  respectively . 
 the si of the age matched td group was employed as the normal 
 criteria .

 the si of the td group 
 was significantly closer to zero than that of the cp group of children . 
 cp and right hemiparetic cp were respectively 4.96 ( 2.24 ) and 5.12 ( 0.83 ) with 
 no significant difference between the hemiparetic sides . 
 the purpose of the present study was to investigate the differences in sitting posture of 
 children with cp while they sat on school chairs . 
 it is known that dynamic postural control 
 during sitting can be reliably assessed using cop data of infants who are developing 
 typically or infants with or at risk of cp14 . 
 the principal finding of this study is that cp children s sitting posture is asymmetrical  
 leaning to the less - paretic side . 
 we thought that infants who are developing typically 
 develop the ability to sit by exhibiting an optimal range of movement variability  whereas 
 cp may present either too much or too little variability leading to a very rigid and narrow 
 or unpredictable set of movement solutions to achieve independent sitting . 
 the finding of 
 this study is agreement with previous studies that have the dissimilarities of the cop 
 patterns of infants with cp and td have been obviously demonstrated14 . 
 the results can not be generalized to all cp 
 children because the sample was limited to ten children and they were at the one stage of 
 the developmental process . 
 future studies should assess the relationship between symmetry of 
 sitting posture and functional activities .","




Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in symmetry of sitting posture between typical developmental (TD) children and hemi-cerebral palsy (CP) children. A school chair mounted on a force platform was used to assess the sitting pressure distribution of 10 TD and 10 CP children. The results showed that the CP children had a significantly more asymmetrical sitting posture compared to TD children.

Research and Discussion:
In this study, the researchers used a force platform to analyze the sitting posture of both TD and CP children. The results revealed that CP children had a higher symmetry index, indicating a more asymmetrical posture, compared to TD children. This suggests that children with CP may have difficulty maintaining a symmetrical sitting posture while using a school chair.

Results and Conclusion:
The findings of this study support the hypothesis that there are significant differences in the symmetry of sitting posture between TD and CP children. The results suggest that TD children have a more symmetrical posture while sitting on school chairs compared to CP children. These findings have important implications for designing chairs and seating systems that can better support the postural needs of children with CP."
"bioethanol is one of the most employed liquid biofuels due to the easy adaptability of this fuel to existing engines and because this is a cleaner fuel with higher octane rating than gasoline . 
 ethanol market grew from less than a billion liters in 1975 to more than 39 billion liters in 2006 and is expected to reach 100 billion liters in 2015 .   among the widely used substrates for ethanol production 
 are the molasses  the wastes byproduct of sugar industries from sugarcane and sugar beet . 
 this is because they are cheap raw materials  readily available  and ready for conversion with limited pretreatments as compared with starchy or cellulosic materials  as all sugars are present in a readily fermentable form . 
 ongoing research and development seeking to improve methods by minimizing the numbers of experiments provide information about the direct additive effects of the study variables and interaction effects using design of experiment methods . 
 recently  this statistical technique has been successfully applied in many fields [ 58 ] . 
 response surface methodology ( rsm ) is a combination of mathematical and statistical techniques and is used for the modeling and analysis of problems in which a response of interest is influenced by several variables  and the objective is to optimize this response . 
 the most popular rsm design is the central composite design ( ccd ) for analysis of experimental data . 
 the ccd is efficient and flexible  providing sufficient information about the effects of variables and overall experimental error with a minimum number of experiments . 
 center points in ccd design are usually repeated 46 times to get a good estimate of experimental error ( pure error ) . 
 five center points are created by default for each factor : alpha  with negative  zero and positive values ( 1  0  and 1 ) . in this study  
 alpha value was taken as one resulting in 3 levels  lowest ( 1 )  middle ( 0 )  and highest ( + 1 ) which is more specifically known as central composite face centered design ( ccfd )  in an attempt to optimize the variables : incubation period  initial ph  incubation temperature  and molasses concentration  which affect bioethanol production . 
 the main goal of the present work was to maximize bioethanol production from sugarcane molasses in batch fermentation process using previously isolated saccharomyces cerevisiae y-39 . 
 the application of ccfd and rsm assisted in designing  modeling  and optimizing the fermentation process by performing a series of controlled laboratory experiments . 
 sugarcane molasses was purchased from sugars and integrated industries egyptian distillation plants in hawamdeia city  giza  egypt and stored at 4c until use . 
 wickerham wh medium prepared according to wickerham   was used for maintenance and inoculum preparation . 
 medium for fermentation experiments was prepared as follows : 2  g kh2po4  10  g ( nh4)2so4  1  g mgso4    7h2o  and 2  g yeast extract were dissolved in 1  l distilled water  molasses concentration and ph were then adjusted according to the experimental conditions before sterilization  at 121c for 20  min to avoid contamination . 
 a yeast strain saccharomyces cerevisiae y-39  previously isolated for its ability to produce bioethanol from different saccharides  was used in this study . 
 active cultures for fermentation experiments were prepared by growing y-39 in wh medium for 48  h at 30c in shaking incubator 150  rpm . 
 harvested cells were washed twice with sterile saline ( 8.5  g nacl per 1  l distilled water ) and then resuspended in sterile saline to be used as a fresh and pure stock for inoculation . 
 the types of sugars in molasses were determined by high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc )  according to the method reported by madian et al . . 
 ashes were quantified by gravimetric analysis after burning samples at 550c for 3  h  and minerals concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer in central analytical lab . in egyptian petroleum research institute . 
 all other chemical characterizations of molasses were done in agricultural research center  giza  egypt . 
 ethanol yield was measured by gas chromatography ( model 6890  agilent )  equipped with flame ionization detector and nominal capillary column ( 60  m  530  m  5.00  m ) . 
 all experiments were carried out in triplicates  and the listed results are the average . 
 batch fermentations were done in 100  ml erlenmeyer flasks fitted with rubber stoppers  containing 50  ml of culture media  inoculated with 5  ml of fresh yeast inoculum stock ( 10  mg fresh yeast / ml ) . 
 incubation was performed in shaking incubator 100  rpm  set at temperatures according to the required experimental conditions . 
 samples for analyses were taken at the beginning and end of fermentation at the prescribed incubation periods . 
 response surface methodology ( rsm ) was used to optimize bioethanol production process from sugarcane molasses and investigate the influence of different fermentation process variables on the bioethanol yield . the central composite face 
 the experimental runs were carried out according to a 2 full factorial design for the four identified design independent variables  namely  incubation period h ( x1 )  initial ph ( x2 )  incubation temperature  c ( x3 )  and molasses concentration wt.% ( x4 )  with low ( 1 ) and high ( + 1 ) levels . 
 the total number of experiments ( runs ) was given by the simple formula [ 30 = 2 + 2k + 6 ]  where k is the number of independent variables ( k = 4 )  this includes 16 factorial points from 24 full factorial ccfd were augmented with 6 replicates at the center point to assess the pure error . 
 the design factors ( variables ) with low 1 and high + 1 levels  are  namely  x1 [ 24 and 72  h ]  x2 [ 5 and 7 ]  x3 [ 20 and 40c ]  and x4 [ 15 and 25  wt.% ] . the central values ; zero level chosen for experimental design were 48  h  6  30c  and 20% for x1  x2  x3  and x4  respectively ( table 1 ) . 
 once the experiments were preformed  the next step was to perform a response surface experiment to produce a prediction model to determine curvature  detect interactions among the design factors ( independent variables )  and optimize the process  that is  determine the local optimum independent variables with maximum yield of bioethanol . 
 the model used in this study to estimate the response surface is the quadratic polynomial represented by the following equation :

 where y is the bioethanol yield ( g / l )  o is the value of the fixed response at the center point of the the design  i  ij  and ii are the linear  interactive  and quadratic coefficients  respectively . 
 xi and xj are the independent variables ( factors ) under study .   the statistical software design expert 6.0.7 ( stat - ease inc .  minneapolis  usa ) was used for design of experiments  regression and graphical analyses of the data obtained  and statistical analysis of the model to evaluate the analysis of variance ( anova ) . 
 sugarcane molasses is a dark viscous fluid with ph value of 5 and very rich in nutrients required by most microorganisms . 
 carbon  nitrogen  phosphorus  sodium  and potassium contents are 64  6  0.3  0.33  and 5.5 ( wt.% )  respectively . 
 non - nitrogenous compounds ( e.g.  citric acid  oxalic acid ) represent 28% ( wt.% ) . 
 molasses is found to be rich in calcium 0.7% and contains significant quantities of trace minerals copper ( 2.2  ppm )  zinc ( 3.91  ppm )  manganese ( 4.74  ppm )  iron ( 78.37  ppm )  and magnesium ( 1370  ppm ) . 
 sugarcane molasses is rich in fermentable sugars 55% ( wt% ) and non - fermentable sugars recorded 5% ( wt% ) . 
 most of the chemical parameters determined in this study were in close agreement to those reported by chen and chou  who found molasses containing 4555% total sugars  2025% reducing sugars  2535% sucrose  1016% ash  0.40.8% calcium  0.10.4% sodium  1.55% potassium and ph 55.5 . 
 soil and climate  the variety and maturity of the cane  and the processing conditions in the factory all influence molasses composition . 
 consequently  considerable variation may be found in nutrient content  flavor  color  and viscosity of molasses . 
 based on ccfd and experimental results  rsm was used to optimize fermentation process design factors ( independent variables ) . 
 the statistical combinations of variables in coded and actual values along with the predicted and experimental responses are presented in table 2 . the regression equation characterizing the influence of different considered variables on process yield was obtained : 
 ( 2)y=177.4 + 6.34x10.41x23.33x32.39x4  33.32x1x2 + 28.51x1x322.11x1x4  27.60x2x3 + 30.38x2x416.39x3x4  0.56x1292.58x22 + 44.08x3266.47x42 . 
 positive sign in front of the terms indicate synergetic effect  whereas negative sign indicates antagonistic effect . 
 pareto chart figure 1  was used in this work to make it much easier to visualize the main and interaction effects of all factors to the response variable  that is  bioethanol yield . 
 the model identified that within the studied range of experiments  the quadratic effect of incubation temperature and the interactive effect of initial ph and molasses concentration and that of incubation period and temperature have highly significant positive influence on the bioethanol yield . 
 that is  with increment of both incubation period and temperature  the bioethanol yield increases  and the same occurred with increment of both ph and molasses concentration . but 
 incubation period has a relatively low significant positive effect on bioethanol yield  while the quadratic effect of initial ph and molasses concentration  and the interactive effect of incubation period and initial ph as well as interactive effect of incubation temperature and initial ph have highly significant inverse effect on the bioethanol yield . 
 the interactive effect of incubation period and molasses concentration and that of incubation temperature and molasses concentration have a significant negative impact on the bioethanol yield . 
 initial ph  incubation temperature  molasses concentration  and the quadratic effect of incubation period seem to have negative impact on bioethanol yield . 
 thus  bioethanol yield decreases with increase of the initial ph and incubation period  incubation temperature and initial ph  incubation period and molasses concentration or incubation temperature and molasses concentration . 
 the validity of the fitted model was evaluated  and its statistical significance was controlled by f - test . 
 the analysis of variance ( anova ) for the response surface full quadratic model is given in table 3 . 
 it can be indicated that the model is highly statistically significant at 95% confidence level  with f - value of 82.14  and very low probability p value of < 0.0001 . 
 the values of the determination coefficients  r  and  radj which measure the model fitting reliability for model ( 2 )  were calculated to be 0.9871 and 0.9751  respectively . 
 this suggests that approximately 98.71% of the variance is attributed to the variables and indicated a high significance of the model . 
 thus  only 0.0129 of the total variations can not be explained by the model which ensures the good adjustment of the above model to experimental data . 
 confirmation of the adequacy of the regression model was reflected also by the good agreement between experimental and predicted values of response variables as shown in table 2 . 
 the lack of fit test is performed by comparing the viability of the current model residuals to the variability between observations at replicate settings of the factors . 
 the lack of fit was statistically significant with f - value of 53.24 and p value of 0.0002 . 
 a significant lack of fit suggests that there may be some systematic variation unaccounted for in the hypothesized model . 
 this may be due to the exact replicate values of the independent variable in the model that provide an estimate of pure error . 
 the relationship between predicted and experimental values of bioethanol yield is shown in figure 2 . 
 it can be seen that there is a high correlation ( r = 0.9853 ) between the predicted and experimental values indicating that the predicted and experimental values were in reasonable agreement . 
 it means that the data fit well with the model and give a convincingly good estimate of response for the system in the experimental range studied . 
 figure 3 shows the normal probability plots of the standardized residuals for bioethanol production efficiency . 
 a normal probability plot indicates that if the residuals follow a normal distribution  in which case the points will follow a straight line . 
 since some scattering is expected even with the normal data  as shown in figure 3  it can be assumed that the data is normally distributed . 
 thus  the obtained normal probability plot indicates a good validity for the approximation of the quadratic regression model . 
  points of observed runs were scattered randomly within the constant range of residuals across the graph . 
 that is  the model is adequate  and there is no reason to suspect any violation of the independence or constant variance assumption in all runs . 
 the standardized residuals versus run plot represented in figure 4(b ) shows randomly scattered points ranged between 2.8 ; the errors were normally distributed and insignificant . 
 the perturbation plot figure 5 shows the comparative effects of all independent variables on bioethanol yield . 
 the sharp curvature of the three factors : initial ph  incubation temperature  and molasses concentration shows that the response  bioethanol yield  was very sensitive to these three variables . 
 the comparatively semiflat incubation period curve shows less sensitivity of bioethanol yield towards the incubation period . 
 thus  the incubation period with the studied range of experiments has no major function in the fermentation process compared to the other three factors . 
 the empirical predicted quadratic model for response ( bioethanol yield ) in terms of process variables ( incubation period  initial ph  incubation temperature  and molasses concentration ) are plotted in three - dimensional diagrams ( figure 6 )  to investigate the interaction among the variables and to determine the optimum condition of each factor for maximum bioethanol yield . 
 figure 6(a ) represents the effects of varying  incubation period and initial ph on bioethanol yield at constant incubation temperature 38c and molasses concentration 18  wt% . 
 however  increase in bioethanol yield occurred with an increase in incubation period at ph range from 5.5 to 6.5 . 
 further increase in initial ph would decrease the bioethanol yield . according to this interaction effects  
 a significant positive impact is detectable ; that is  bioethanol yield increased with the increase of incubation temperature and time . 
 figure 6(c ) shows the interactive effect of incubation period h and molasses concentration wt.% on bioethanol production at constant initial ph 5.6 and incubation temperature 38c . 
 it is obvious that with the increase of molasses concentration above 20  wt%  bioethanol yield decreases . 
 g / l obtained at higher incubation period 72  h and 20  wt.% molasses concentration . 
 figure 6(d ) shows the cooperative effect of incubation temperature and initial ph on bioethanol yield at constant incubation period 72  h and molasses concentration 18  wt% . as shown in figure 6(d )  at low and high ph values  the bioethanol yield decreases . the maximum bioethanol yield 257 
 g / l was obtained at high incubation temperature 40c and initial ph of 6 . 
 figure 6(e ) illustrates the interactive effect of initial ph and molasses concentration on bioethanol yield at constant incubation period 72  h and temperature 40c . 
 where  bioethanol yield is low at both low and high molasses concentrations and initial ph . 
 but bioethanol yield increases within ph range 5.56.5 and molasses concentration 18%22% with maximum yield of 257 
 g / l at ph and molasses concentration of 6 and 20%  respectively . 
 figure 6(f ) represents the interactive effect of incubation temperature and molasses concentration on bioethanol yield at constant incubation period 72  h and initial ph 5.6 . 
 it is obvious that with the increase in temperature  the bioethanol yield increases reaching its maximum at 40c  while at low and high molasses concentrations the yield decreases and increased within 18%22% . 
 g / l is obtained at molasses concentration and incubation temperature of 20% and 40c . 
 the optimization process was carried out to determine the optimum value of bioethanol production efficiency  using the design expert 6.0.7 software . according to the software optimization step  the desired goal for each operational condition ( x1 incubation period  x2 initial ph  x3 incubation temperature  and x4 molasses concentration ) was chosen  within  the studied range . 
 the response ( bioethanol production ) was defined as maximum to achieve the highest performance . 
 the program combines the individual desirability into a single number and then searches to optimize this function based on the response goal . 
 accordingly  the optimum working conditions and respective bioethanol production were established  and the results are presented in table 4 . an additional experiment was then performed to confirm the optimum results . as shown  the maximum bioethanol production was 255 
 g / l at incubation period of 71  h  initial ph 5.6  incubation temperature 38c  and molasses concentration of 18% . 
 recording average of 1.08 and 0.87%  respectively  indicating that process optimization by ccfd was capable and reliable to optimize bioethanol production from sugarcane molasses using saccharomyces cerevisiae y-39 . 
 rsm and ccfd proved to be reliable and powerful tool for modeling  optimizing and studying the interactive effects of four process variables ( incubation period  initial ph  incubation temperature  and molasses concentration ) of bioethanol production from batch fermentation of sugarcane molasses using locally isolated saccharomyces cerevisiae y-39 . 
 a highly significant ( r = 0.9871  p < 0.0001 ) regression quadratic model equation was obtained by analyzing the data of a 2 factorial design . the maximum predicted and actual bioethanol yields are 253 and 255","

1) Abstract: A statistical model was developed to optimize bioethanol production from sugarcane molasses using locally isolated yeast. Central composite face centered design was used to evaluate and optimize the conditions for maximum yield. The maximum production achieved was 255 g/L. 

2) Research and Discussion: The study employed response surface methodology to statistically analyze and optimize the conditions for bioethanol production from sugarcane molasses. The results showed that factors such as incubation period, initial pH, and incubation temperature had a significant impact on bioethanol yield. Local yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y-39 was found to be effective in producing high levels of bioethanol. 

3) Results and Conclusion: At optimum operating conditions of 71 hours of incubation, pH 5.6, 38°C, and 18% molasses concentration, a maximum bioethanol production of 255 g/L was obtained. The study highlights the potential for bioethanol production from sugarcane molasses using locally isolated yeast. Further research can be done to optimize the process and scale up production for commercial use."
"in 1989  caffe et al .   published a method for organ culture in which the neuroretina was placed with the photoreceptor layer facing downward on rafts made of nitrocellulose filters and polyamide gauze grids . 
 since then  mammalian retinal organ cultures have been commonly used to research retinal physiology and pathobiology . 
 retinal cell dynamics have shown that organotypic models can be comparable with in vivo conditions  especially those of the outer retina . 
 thus  retinal cultures are still used in electrophysiological studies to monitor drug effects on retinal cell functionality  to evaluate neurotrophic factors or physical tension on retinal cells  and to study the molecular basis of potential therapies for photoreceptor death . 
 our group has previously used neuroretina explant cultures to evaluate modifications induced by exogenous cells such as blood - derived macrophages or by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf- ) that are implicated in the pathobiology of proliferative vitreoretinopathy . 
 we have also established a mixed coculture model composed of three cellular layers  the neuroretina  the rpe  and adipose tissue - derived stem cells  to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of stem cells . 
 there are some obvious limitations of these culture systems  such as the axotomy of ganglion cells as part of the dissection procedure and the absence of a blood supply . 
 thus  degenerative changes in retinal cells  especially at the inner retina  could differ from in vivo conditions . 
 the rpe is a monolayer of pigmented  cuboidal epithelial cells that are closely associated with the photoreceptor outer segments . 
 the most important functions of the rpe are the synthesis and maintenance of the interphotoreceptor matrix  photoreceptor membrane turnover  and retinoid metabolism . 
 rpe association is supported by the fact that neuroretinas adjoined to rpe monolayer cultures have better - preserved tissue architecture in culture studies . 
 the rpe is also considered a key element in the development of some retinal diseases and  importantly  in the physiopathology of retinal detachment and central serous chorioretinopathy . in these pathologies  the neuroretina and the rpe 
 furthermore  the rpe secretes across the apical membrane neuroprotective factors that helps to maintain retinal homeostasis . 
 thus  an adequate ex vivo tool for studying retinal degeneration and the importance of molecular signaling across the subretinal space after physical separation of the neuroretina and the rpe would be inherent to overcome the complexities that are inherent in vivo studies . in this study  we developed and characterized a novel organotypic coculture system in which the central cone - dominated porcine neuroretina was cocultured with rpe cells that were maintained physically separated from the neuroretina by the culture medium and a porous membrane . 
 this arrangement prevented any physical contact between the cocultured cells but allowed signal molecules to pass between them . 
 this model could be useful for studying in vitro the interactions between the neuroretina and the rpe when they lose their natural contact  as happens in several retinal diseases such as retinal detachment and central serous chorioretinopathy . 
 further  this ex vivo model will allow study of the role of rpe - secreted factors and the evaluation of potential therapies for reducing the progression of neuroretina degeneration . 
 fifteen porcine eyes from animals aged 68 months were obtained from the local slaughterhouse and processed within 2 h of death . 
 immediately after enucleation  the eyes were immersed in ice - cold transport medium composed of dulbecco s modified eagle medium ( dmem ) supplemented with a 10% antibiotic - antimycotic mixture containing penicillin  streptomycin  and amphotericin b ( gibco  invitrogen  paisley  uk ) and transported on ice to the laboratory . under aseptic conditions in a laminar airflow hood  the eyes were dissected free from all periocular tissue . after full immersion of the eyeballs in 70% ethanol during 2 min  the eyes were washed in clean dmem supplemented with 10% antibiotic - antimycotic at room temperature .

 however  some cells had dedifferentiated morphology  with increased size and reduced pigment content ( figure 3b  arrowheads ) . 
 cellular characteristics were maintained until passage 2  when the rpe cells were cocultured with neuroretina explants . at coculture

 the present study described the development and characterization of a novel coculture model of cone - dominated porcine central retina and rpe cells to closely simulate ex vivo the subretinal space microenvironment . 
 retinal degeneration is a common finding of many retinal diseases  and in some cases  such as retinal detachment and central serous chorioretinopathy  it is in part the consequence of physical separation between the neuroretina and the rpe . 
 this separation starts a cascade of events that result in cellular changes throughout the retina . 
 these events are in part responsible for the poor functional results that can occur even after successful reattachment surgery . 
 currently  research in retinal degeneration is largely limited due to the difficulty in obtaining specimens from freshly detached human retinas and the limitations of experimental animal models . in this sense  
 importantly  they closely simulate in vivo retinal cellular and molecular dynamics and have been the source of improved knowledge of retinal physiopathology in recent decades . 
 nevertheless  these previously reported culture models lack the influence of the rpe cells that are necessary for maintaining the viability and functionality of the outermost retinal layers . 
 furthermore  rpe cells secrete various growth and trophic factors that act on the neuroretina and the choroidal endothelium . 
 the rpe also plays an important role in the retinal degeneration process and is considered a key element in retinal detachment physiopathology . 
 there are some obvious limitations of these culture systems  such as the absence of choroidal and retinal blood flow  the lack of vitreous  and the axotomy of ganglion cells  that may considerably limit the study of the inner retina modifications . 
 however  neuroretina organotypic cultures are still considered an adequate tool for improving knowledge of retinal physiopathology . 
 other authors have previously described models in which rpe monolayers were cocultured in contact with the neuroretina . 
 those models are complex to develop and do not adequately mimic a retinal pathology related to the separation between the neuroretina and the rpe . 
 our purpose was to study and characterize the differences between neuroretinas cultured alone and those cocultured with rpe cells while physically separated from each other . 
 this novel model could be the basis for studying the interaction between the neuroretina and rpe cells when they are separated in vivo because no such studies currently exist . in this model 
  neuroretina explants were cultured over cell culture membranes that physically separated the rpe cells cultured on the bottom of the cell culture inserts . 
 thus  the porous cell culture membranes inhibit rpe cell migration into the retinal tissue and direct contact with neuroretina cells ; while molecular exchange among the different cell types can occur . in this scenario  rpe - secreted factors can diffuse through the cell culture membrane pores and influence neuroretina cell dynamics  thus recreating the subretinal space milieu . 
 the porcine retina possesses some characteristics that make this species particularly useful in retinal research  such as retinal extent  ultrastructure  and the lack of a tapetum . 
 the retinal parenchyma is quite similar to that of humans  with a double circulation system and a central zone  the visual streak . 
 this zone is a broad horizontal retinal streak above the optic disc  with high cone density and without direct vascularization . unlike the human fovea  
 the porcine retina has a rod density that is similar to that of humans  and the cellular dynamics after neuroretina  rpe separation are comparable in both species  especially those of key cells such as mller and rpe cells . therefore  
 in the coculture model that we have developed  we used explants from the porcine cone - dominated area centralis because of the similarity with the human central retina . 
 as shown with phase contrast microscopy  rpe cells largely maintained their morphological characteristics throughout the coculture period . 
 furthermore  these cells maintained the expression of zo-1 outlining the polygonal shape of the rpe cells within the monolayer  and rpe65 supporting the preservation of the rpe phenotype  without dedifferentiation to form other cell types or undergoing an epithelial  mesenchymal transition . 
 as previously described in primary rpe cell cultures  a few clusters of cells became partially dedifferentiated . 
 cralbp immunoexpression was not observed in rpe cells cocultured with neuroretinas  probably due to the loss of normal cell polarization  especially seen as the disappearance of the apical microvilli . 
 the ability of rpe in culture to secrete neurotrophic factors has been described by other authors . in the cultures in the present study  the neuroretina explants without the rpe showed degenerative alterations in the tissue and retina cells as previously described . 
 however  the presence of degenerative rosette - like structures reported here were not observed by our group in previous work in which the central retina was not used . 
 our immunohistochemical studies revealed retinal cell degenerative modifications as we   and others previously described in organotypic porcine retina cultures . 
 although rho and cralbp immunoexpression was better preserved and lower levels of gfap were detected in the neuroretinas cocultured with rpe cells  we did not quantify the gfap or cralbp labeling  and this will be part of future experiments . 
 however  it is not clear if that is related to cellular swelling or to better cellular viability . in this sense 
  it will be useful to explore cell death and survival in future studies . in any case  the neuroretina explants cocultured with rpe cells maintained better preserved tissue and cellular characteristics and significantly better conserved tissue and nuclear layer thicknesses . 
 these findings were consistent through the complete 5-mm neuroretina explants and were observed in all the experiments performed . 
 based on the morphological and immunohistochemical results found in this study  neuroretina preservation in cocultures with rpe cells may be partially linked to neuroprotective factors secreted by rpe cells . 
 the secretion of neurotrophic / neuroprotective factors by rpe cells is stimulated during retinal damage . 
 our group has developed and standardized a novel coculture model of central cone  dominated porcine neuroretina that was supplemented with rpe cells maintained separately within the same culture wells . 
 this coculture system mimics ex vivo the subretinal space that develops during retinal detachment ( rd ) and other disease conditions of the retina . 
 compared to the neuroretina explant cultures alone  the presence of cocultured rpe provided improved neuroretina architecture and thickness  better preservation of rho and cralbp immunoexpression  and lower levels of gfap . 
 these data suggest that the cocultured rpe  while not in direct contact with the neuroretina explant  had a neuroprotective role . this effect may be linked to the beneficial effects of neurotrophic factors secreted or induced by rpe cells during coculture . 
 furthermore  the proposed model will be useful to better study interactions between the rpe and the neuroretina and to test neuroprotective and/or anti - inflammatory drugs for retinal degenerative diseases .

Abstract: A novel organ culture model using porcine central neuroretina explants and RPE cells separated by a cell culture membrane was developed and standardized. The model displayed better preservation of tissue structure and organization as well as lower levels of reactive gliosis markers. Neuroretina thickness was significantly improved in the coculture model.

Research and Discussion: RPE cells were successfully isolated and cultured on cell culture inserts while neuroretina explants were obtained from the area centralis and cultured separately or with RPE cells physically separated. The coculture model mimics the subretinal space and can be used to study interactions between RPE and neuroretina, and preclinically test potential therapies.

Results and Conclusion: The coculture model showed better preservation of tissue structure and organization as well as lower levels of reactive gliosis markers, making it a promising tool for future research. In addition, neuroretina thickness was significantly greater in the cocultures, demonstrating the potential for this model to improve retinal health. This organ culture model could aid in the development of therapies for retinal diseases."
"ectopic kidney is a relatively rare renal anomaly however  an endourologist does encounter stone disease in an ectopic kidney occasionally . 
 factors such as anomalous blood vessels and tortuous ureter with high insertion can lead to poor drainage and predisposition to the formation of renal calculi in these patients . 
 the common management option for such stones is laparoscopy or ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( pcnl ) . 
 we report our experience with the use the recently described micro - pcnl or  microperc  for two such cases . 
 two male patients  aged 57 and 60 years respectively  presented to us with calculi in ectopic pelvic kidneys . 
 the first patient had undergone a flexible ureterorenoscopy elsewhere during which the stone could not be reached due to difficult angulation and inflamed tissue leading to poor vision . computed tomography urogram revealed an ectopic malrotated left kidney lying over the sacrum . 
 there was a 13 mm  11 mm sized calculus in the renal pelvis [ figure 1a and b ] . in the second patient  
 computed tomography urogram revealed a normal right kidney and an ectopic malrotated left kidney lying over the sacrum . 
 there was an 18 mm  17 mm sized calculus ( 1232 hu ) in the pelvis and a 5 mm  4 mm sized calculus ( 423 hu ) in the lower calyx of the ectopic kidney [ figure 1c and d ] . 
 ( a ) x - ray kub showing renal calculus in pelvis of pelvic ectopic kidney with double j stent in situ  ( b ) computed tomography urogram showing the pelvicalyceal system anatomy  ( c ) x - ray kub showing renal calculus ( yellow arrow ) in ectopic kidney  ( d ) computed tomography urogram showing the pelvicalyceal system anatomy ( location of pelvic stone - yellow arrow ; location of lower calyceal stone - red arrow ) both procedures were performed under general anesthesia . in lithotomy position  
 ureteric catheterization was carried out under cystoscopic guidance using 7 fr ureteric catheters over a 0.035 inch glidewire ( terumo  tokyo  japan ) . 
 the position was changed to supine - oblique with a sandbag under the ipsilateral hemipelvis to move the overlying bowel away from the kidney . 
 an ultrasound probe was pressed against the anterior abdominal wall to displace the bowel away from the line of access . 
 further  colour doppler was used to rule out any significant blood vessel in the path of needle puncture . 
 three - way connector was attached to the needle  allowing saline irrigation  passage of a 0.9 mm flexible microperc telescope  and a 272 m holmium : yttrium aluminum garnet ( ho : yag ) laser fiber [ figure 2 ] . 
 the stones were completely fragmented to dust with the laser . an x - ray and ultrasound 
 was obtained on the first post - operative day to document stone clearance and to rule out any fluid collection . 
 the urethral catheter was removed on the first post - operative day and the patient was discharged . 
 ( a ) surface view of patient position and ultrasound guided percutaneous renal access  ( b ) intraoperative ultrasonography picture showing entry of puncture needle ( yellow arrows ) into lower calyx containing calculus ( red arrow )  ( c ) confirmation of access into lower calyx by antegrade contrast study to delineate pelvicalyceal system  ( d ) intraoperative surface view showing microperc instruments  ( e ) puncture site at the end of the procedure ( yellow arrow )  ( f ) post - operative x - ray kub showing complete clearance operating times were 30 and 35 min respectively . 
 in the first patient  ureteric catheter was left in situ for 1 day . in the second patient  
 ureteric catheter was replaced by a double - j stent at the end of the procedure . 
 visual analog pain scores ( 1 - 10 scale ) on first post - operative day were two and three respectively . 
 first post - operative day and 1 month follow - up x - ray and ultrasound kub revealed complete stone clearance and no evidence of fluid collection in the abdomen . 
 options for managing small renal calculi in pelvic ectopic kidney are shock wave lithotripsy ( swl )  retrograde intrarenal surgery ( rirs )  ultrasound or laparoscopy guided pcnl . since these kidneys are surrounded by bowel and bone  
 moreover  the clearance of fragmented stones is also impaired due to high insertion of ureter and impaired pyeloureteral motility due to surrounding fibrous bands . 
 rirs can be technically demanding due to abnormal and tortuous course of the ureter of a pelvic kidney . 
 this was exemplified by our first patient in whom the stone could not be reached with flexible ureteroscope and the procedure had to be abandoned . 
 the potential hazards in percutaneous access in an ectopic kidney are : ( 1 ) risk of injury to surrounding bowel  particularly if track dilatation is carried out through the bowel  ( 2 ) abnormal vasculature resulting in bleeding from tract dilatation and ( 3 ) spillage of fluid into peritoneal cavity . 
 microperc is a minimally invasive form of pcnl in which percutaneous renal access and stone fragmentation are achieved in a single - step using a 16 g needle . since dilatation is not performed  potential hazards associated with it are avoided . 
 fluid collection is less likely during puncture and at the end of the procedure since the needle puncture site closes quickly . 
 both our patients had rapid post - operative recovery  probably due to lack of fluid spillage and hence no paralytic ileus . 
 though laparoscopic guidance has been advocated for percutaneous access of an ectopic kidney  in experienced hands  ultrasound guidance can provide a safe entry into the appropriate calyx . 
 appropriate patient positioning to move bowel away from the kidney  placing a sand bag to push the kidney towards the anterior abdominal wall and compression with the ultrasound transducer allow safe access into the kidney . 
 further  the use of colour doppler rules out any significant blood vessel along the path of needle puncture . the hemoglobin drop in both of our patients was minimal  supporting the safety of this procedure . in laparoscopy guided pcnl  an abdominal drain may need to be left in situ for a prolonged period because of persistent urinary leakage . 
 the average hospital stay in a series of 15 patients who underwent laparoscopy guided pcnl was 4.8 days ( 4 - 11 days ) . 
 the patients in that series had sequential removal of nephrostomy tube  urethral catheter and abdominal drain  which lead to the prolonged post - operative stay . 
 thus  ultrasound guided microperc is a safe and efficient technique in the management of small renal calculi in ectopic kidneys and it is a minimally invasive procedure with short hospital stay .","

Abstract:

The management of stone disease in an ectopic kidney can be challenging. Laparoscopy, ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and retrograde intra-renal surgery are preferred techniques. We present two cases where ultrasound guided microperc using a 16 g needle was performed for renal calculi in pelvic ectopic kidneys. This approach proved to be safe and effective, with complete stone clearance achieved in both patients and discharge on the first post-operative day.

Research and Discussion:
Ectopic kidneys pose unique challenges in the management of renal calculi, and various techniques have been utilized. Among these, laparoscopy, ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and retrograde intra-renal surgery have been found to be effective. Our research focuses on the use of ultrasound guided microperc for small renal calculi in pelvic ectopic kidneys. Advantages of this technique include its safety, efficacy, and minimal invasiveness.

Results and Conclusion:
Our study highlights the successful use of ultrasound guided microperc for the management of renal calculi in pelvic ectopic kidneys. Both patients showed complete stone clearance and no intraoperative or post-operative complications. This technique provides a safe and effective alternative, especially for smaller stones in this challenging population. Further research and long-term follow-up are needed to fully evaluate its potential."
"intra - radicular posts are commonly used to restore endodontically treated teeth if their 
 remaining coronal tissue could no longer provide adequate support and retention for the 
 restoration . 
 although the use 
 of prefabricated posts has gained popularity  for several years 
 custom cast dowel and core has been used to retain restorations with clinical evidence 
 of success . 
 one important advantage 
 of this post system is that the dowel will fit a flared or irregularly shaped canal more 
 closely than prefabricated post systems do . 
 however  although endodontic therapy has shown a high success rate  adverse situations 
 that require endodontic retreatment are not rare . 
 when signs  symptoms and radiographic images suggest the failure 
 of endodontic treatment  an atraumatic and efficient post removal is essential for 
 optimal non - surgical endodontic management . 
 drills and extractors exert high force on the root and may result in root 
 fractures . 
 ultrasonic energy is transmitted to the post  causing 
 cracks in the cement thus facilitating its removal . 
 recent evidence suggests that ultrasonic vibration is a safe and fast method for post 
 removal . 
 however  several in vitro studies have evaluated post removal 
 with ultrasonic devices by using roots of extract teeth included in resin 
 cylinders . this procedure is used in order to facilitate handling 
 and test application . however 
 clinically  
 the root is enveloped by periodontal ligament ( pdl )  which presents higher resiliency 
 than resins used for root inclusion . 
 this difference in resiliencies enables pdl to 
 dissipate the ultrasonic energy more easily than when the root is included in a resin 
 cylinder . 
 thus  the facility 
 found in some in vitro studies for post removal with ultrasound 
 activation may not be consistent with the clinical reality . 
 the simulation of the pdl in 
 these tests would be important to bring the laboratory findings to clinical 
 application . 
 the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of simulated 
 periodontal ligament ( spdl ) on custom cast dowel and core removal using an ultrasonic 
 device . 
 the null hypothesis was that the spdl does not influence the action of the 
 ultrasonic device used to remove the cast dowel and core from the root canal . 
 thirty - two human maxillary canines with mature apices  un - pronounced flattening  roots 
 with no curves and single canal were selected for this study . 
 crowns were removed in 
 order to obtain a 15-mm - long root remainder . for the endodontic treatment  the root 
 canals 
 were prepared according to a crown - down technique  using stainless - steel k - files 
 and # 2 to # 4 gates - glidden drills ( dentsply maillefer ; ballaigues  switzerland ) . 
 all 
 enlargement procedures were followed by irrigation with a 2.5% sodium hypochlorite 
 solution . 
 instrumented root canals were obturated with gutta - percha cones and sealer-26 
 resin sealer ( dentsply  petrpolis  rj  brazil ) using the lateral condensation 
 technique . 
 the filled roots were stored in relative humidity for at least 72 h to allow 
 the resin sealer to set . 
 the specimens were randomly allocated according to presence of 
 spdl and application of ultrasonic vibration . 
 half of the roots were included directly in self - cured acrylic resin cylinders ( jet 
 clssico  so paulo  sp  brazil ) without spdl . 
 the external surfaces of 
 the root remainders were dipped into melted wax ( epoxiglass  diadema  sp  brazil )  
 resulting in a 0.2 to 0.3-mm - thick wax layer . 
 after resin polymerization  the roots were removed from the cylinder  the wax 
 removed from the root surface creating a space in the resin cylinder . 
 the polyether 
 impression material ( impregum f  3m / espe  seefeld  germany ) was mixed and placed in the 
 space created in the resin cylinder . 
 the tooth was re - inserted into the cylinder and the 
 excess material removed with a scalpel blade . in order to allow tensile testing without 
 the root becoming dislodged 
  the roots included in resin cylinder with spdl were fixed 
 to cylinders with two stainless steel wires about 1 mm in diameter ( figure 2 ) . 
 note the presence of two wires in order to prevent the root dislodgement during 
 testing post - holes were prepared by standardizing the length at 8 mm and preparation was 
 performed with a size 6 largo drill ( dentsply maillefer ) . 
 this drill was used with a 
 low - speed handpiece attached to a parallelometer . 
 the root canal impressions were made 
 with self - cured resin acrylic ( duralay  reliance dental  worth  il  usa ) . 
 the dowel and cores were cast in 
 a nickel - chromium alloy ( wironia  bego  bremen  germany ) . 
 all custom cast dowel and 
 cores were luted with dual - cured resin cement ( panavia f ; kuraray  osaka  japan )  in 
 accordance with the manufacturer 's instructions . 
 after the storage period  half of specimens of each inclusion type ( with or without 
 spdl ) were submitted to ultrasonic vibration . 
 this was applied by the same calibrated 
 operator  using a piezoelectric ultrasonic device ( enac  osada electric co ltd .  
 tokyo  
 japan )  and an st 09 tip ( osada electric co. ltd . )  at maximum power under water 
 cooling . 
 the vibration was applied for 1 min to the buccal  mesial  lingual  distal  and 
 incisal surfaces  successively  with total application time of 4 min for each sample 
 ( figure 3 ) . 
 samples were positioned in a 
 universal testing machine ( model 4411  instron corp .  canton  ma  usa ) and the ring of 
 the core was attached to the load cell ( 500 n ) . 
 tensile load was applied at a crosshead 
 speed of 0.5 mm / min until the cast dowel and core was dislodged ( figure 4 ) . 
 the 
 factors evaluated were "" presence of spdl "" and "" ultrasonic vibration application "" . 
 post - hoc tests were calculated using tukey`s multiple - comparison test 
 ( =0.05 ) . 
 application of ultrasonic vibration application of tensile load at samples until dislodgment of the custom cast dowel 
 and core . 
 a and b - without simulated periodontal ligament ; c and d - with 
 simulated periodontal ligament 
 there was a statistically significant effect for the factors "" presence of spdl "" 
 ( p<0.01 )  "" ultrasonic vibration application "" ( p<0.01 ) and for interaction between 
 factors ( p<0.05 ) . 
 the means tensile strength values in kgf ( sd ) necessary to dislodge 
 the cast post - and - cores and the results of the tukey 's test are shown in table 1 . 
 when ultrasonic vibration was not applied  
 samples with spdl presented the lowest tensile bond strength values . 
 no significant 
 differences were observed in the presence or absence of spdl in samples submitted to 
 ultrasonic vibration . ultrasonic vibration application led to the lowest values when the 
 pdl was not simulated  but had no effect on samples with spdl . 
 tensile strength means values in kgf ( sd ) necessary to dislodge the cast 
 post - and - cores 
 the influence of pdl is often omitted in in vitro tests that evaluate 
 post removal using ultrasonic devices  as opposed to other studies that evaluate the 
 in vitro fracture resistance of restored teeth . 
 the pdl is an 
 important structure for distributing the stress generated by load application on teeth . 
 based on this  elastomeric materials have been used to reproduce the pdl in several 
 studies . 
 polyether 
 impression material is adequate for such purpose because of its ease of use  consistency 
 and deformation limit . 
 one 
 difficulty of using spdl in tensile tests is the possibility of it being dislodged 
 during load application . in the present study  roots were fixed in a resin cylinder with 
 two stainless steel wires to prevent dislodgment of root and allow testing . 
 this 
 methodology enabled tensile load application on samples included with spdl  but it had 
 an influence on the tensile bond strength values . 
 samples included in the cylinder with the presence of spdl presented lower bond strength 
 values than those directly included in resin  when the ultrasonic vibrations were not 
 applied . 
 one possible explanation for this may be related to the forces resulting during 
 tensile load application . during the test  the deformation of wires used to fix the root 
 allowed a slight dislodgement of the root . 
 thus  the tensile load is more concentrated at the interface 
 between resin cement and dowel for the samples included with spdl . 
 this results in the 
 need for lower loads to remove these cast dowel and cores . despite this influence on the load distribution  
 the simulation of pdl also intervened 
 in the effectiveness of the ultrasonic vibration to reduce the dowel retention . 
 the 
 tensile bond strength of the samples included in resin cylinders with spdl was not 
 altered by use of the ultrasound device  as opposed to samples included without spdl . 
 the reduction in cast dowel and core retention 
 with the application of ultrasonic energy has been demonstrated by several 
 studies . 
 the ultrasonic device used in this study has a 
 piezoelectric transducer that transforms electricity into ultrasonic vibrations . 
 quartz 
 crystals within the transducer are vibrated by the electricity flowing through them . by 
 applying an alternating electrical field across the crystal  
 these ultrasonic vibrations are transmitted through the dowel and 
 core  fracturing the cement interposed between the dowel and the root canal walls and 
 facilitate their removal . 
 several studies has reported that the type of luting agent can influence the post 
 retention and removal procedure . 
 posts cemented with resin cements usually require greater force for 
 their removal when compared to those cemented with zinc phosphate or glass ionomer 
 cements . in this study 
  the cast dowel and cores 
 were luted with the resin cement panavia f. this cement contains the resin monomer 
 10-mdp ( 10-methacryloyloxydecyl di - hydrogen phosphate ) in its composition  which bonds 
 to metal oxides . 
 considering that it is essential for 
 the vibrations to reach the resin cement in order to facilitate dowel and core removal  
 the root inclusion method may affect the efficacy of the ultrasonic device . 
 the high rigidity of acrylic resin used for sample inclusion does not allow for root 
 movement during the ultrasound application . 
 thus  approximately all the energy dispensed 
 by the tip of the ultrasonic device is transmitted through the cast dowel and core to 
 reach the resin cement . on the other hand  the root mobility permitted by impression 
 material may to reduce the energy that reaches the resin cement . 
 thus  the resin cement was submitted to 
 lower strain  which was not sufficient to reduce the retention of cast dowel and core . 
 the latter situation is closer to clinical reality than directly including the root in 
 resin cylinders . 
 therefore  within the limitations of this study  it was demonstrated 
 that the pdl simulation had a significant effect on custom cast dowel and core removal 
 with ultrasonic vibrations . 
 this means that several of the in vitro 
 studies that evaluated ultrasonic devices for dowel and core removal may have 
 overestimated their efficacy . 
 the ultrasonic vibration had no effect on cast dowel - and - core retention when the pdl was 
 simulated . 
 the present outcomes demonstrate the importance of this simulation during 
 in vitro evaluation to avoid overestimating the efficacy of 
 ultrasonic vibration used for cast dowel - and - core removal .",".

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of simulated periodontal ligament (SPDL) on custom cast dowel and core removal by ultrasonic vibration. Thirty-two human maxillary canines were included in the study, and data was analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests.

Research and Discussion:
The roots with SPDL were fixed to cylinders with two stainless steel wires, and half of the samples were subjected to ultrasonic vibration before tensile testing. The results showed that the presence of SPDL affected the tensile strength values, and ultrasonic vibration reduced the strength of samples included in resin cylinders.

Results and Conclusion:
The study concluded that simulated PDl has an effect on the tensile strength of custom cast dowel and core sets, both with and without the use of ultrasonic vibration. This highlights the importance of considering the presence of PDl when conducting both ultrasonic vibration and tensile testing in similar studies."
"human metapneumovirus ( hmpv ) is an rna virus in the pneumovirinae subfamily of the paramyxoviridae family that was first isolated in the netherlands in 2001 and has subsequently been identified worldwide . 
 it has been implicated as a significant cause of hospitalization for young children  second only to respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) in infants hospitalized with acute respiratory infections ( aris ) . 
 hmpv has been detected in 1.543.0% of patients with aris . while it circulates predominantly in the winter  
 seroprevalence studies have shown that almost all children over five years of age have evidence of past infection . 
 clinical syndromes associated with hmpv infection are similar to those of rsv infection  ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infections to wheezing and severe lower respiratory tract infections requiring mechanical ventilation . 
 rare cases of fatalities have been associated with hmpv and it has been implicated in a handful of cases of encephalitis . although hmpv infections have been diagnosed in adults  their greatest impact occurs in children . 
 a significant association with hmpv and wheezing is seen in young children  and hmpv has been linked to apparent life - threatening events in infants . 
 hmpv has been associated with aris with super - infections as a result of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae . to begin to understand the impact of hmpv on our institution 
  we analyzed children admitted to our tertiary care center in southeast michigan with respiratory symptoms during the respiratory season of 20062007 through an observational  retrospective study . 
 the primary purposes of our study were to establish the utility of testing for hmpv in children who were admitted to our hospital during the respiratory virus season and to compare the impact of hmpv and rsv on the healthcare system . 
 we identified a convenience sample of 256 nasopharyngeal ( np ) specimens from children younger than 18 years of age admitted with respiratory symptoms between november 1  2006 and may 31  2007 . 
 the specimens were obtained by a np wash or swab based on the admitting physician s discretion . after routine testing by direct fluorescent antibody ( dfa ) and/or culture for rsv  parainfluenza viruses 13  influenza viruses a and b  adenovirus  and rhinovirus  
 the np specimens were frozen at 70c and later subjected to nucleic acid extraction using the easymag system ( biomrieux  durham  nc  usa ) and following the manufacturer s protocol with slight modifications . 
 two hundred microliters of each specimen were pre - treated with 20 units of dnase ( new england biolabs  uk ) at 37c for 45 min before extraction . 
 extracts were used as the template for detection of hmpv using the nuclisense real - time analyte specific reagent ( asr ) assay performed on the easyq instrument ( biomrieux ) . 
 a proprietary internal control containing the same primer binding sites as the hmpv target with unique internal sequences targeted by a separate molecular beacon probe were spiked into each specimen before extraction to monitor amplification integrity . 
 laboratory personnel were blinded to the clinical data and the clinical investigator was blinded to the laboratory results . only the first specimen from which a virus was identified per admission was considered . 
 the -test was used for analysis of categorical variables  comparing hmpv - positive patients to rsv - positive patients as well as patients who were negative for both hmpv and rsv . 
 the student s t - test was used for an analysis that compared continu ous variables . 
 of the 256 specimens  rsv was identified in 52 ( 20.3% )  hmpv in 18 ( 7.0% )  influenza in 9 ( 3.5% )  rhinovirus in 5 ( 2.0% )  parainfluenza in 8 ( 3.1% )  and adenovirus in 4 ( 1.6% ) . 
 three specimens had co - infections : hmpv and rsv in two and rsv and influenza a in one . 
 hmpv was detected primarily in specimens collected between january and march ( 83.4% )  while rsv was uniformly detected in those from november through february and then decreased into may . 
 no hmpv was detected in specimens obtained in april and may ( figure 1 ) . because the primary goal of our study was to compare patients with hmpv to those with rsv  and 
 because the number of patients with isolated viruses other than hmpv or rsv was low  cases with viruses other than hmpv or rsv and those with no specific virus isolated were combined as a separate group for the additional analyses detailed in the following section . 
 while several studies have shown that hmpv occurs more in older children than does rsv  other reports showed no difference in age predilection  gender predominance  or presence of underlying medical disorders . in our study  the majority of hmpv - positive patients were aged 1324 months ( n=7  43.8% )  whereas most rsv - positive patients ( n=35 ; 71.4% ) were younger than 12 months of age ( p<0.01 ) . 
 underlying medical disorders considered were prematurity  chronic lung disease  bronchopulmonary dysplasia  asthma  congenital heart disease  congestive heart failure  immunosuppression  immunodeficiencies  hematological and solid organ malignancies  diabetes  and renal failure . 
 we also found that children attending daycare or school were not at increased risk of being positive for hmpv or rsv or for having a respiratory illness not associated with either of these viruses ( table 1 ) .

 mean duration of hospital stay was 6 days ( range 137 d ) for hmpv - positive patients  6 days ( range 1112 d ) for rsv - positive patients  and 12 days ( range 1117 d ) for patients negative for hmpv and rsv ( p=0.83 for hmpv vs. rsv ; p=0.06 for hmpv vs. negative for hmpv and rsv ) . 
 hmpv - positive patients were more likely to be treated with antibiotics than were rsv - positive patients ( 81.2% vs. 51.0%  p=0.03 ) and were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit ( icu ) ( 37.5% vs. 12.2%  p=0.02 ) . 
 hmpv - positive patients were as likely to require oxygen supplementation  mechanical ventilation  and steroid use as were rsv - positive patients ( table 2 ) . 
 infections with hmpv and rsv have been reported to be clinically indistinguishable  but subtle differences were identified in our study . 
 the most common presenting symptom for hmpv - positive patients was fever  which occurred more often in hmpv - positive patients than in the other two patient populations . 
 hmpv - positive patients were also more likely than patients negative for hmpv and rsv to have decreased urine output ( table 3 ; 43.8% vs. 14.4%  p<0.01 ) . on physical examination  
 hmpv - positive patients were more likely than rsv - positive patients to exhibit focal decreased breath sounds ( 18.8% vs. 2.0%  p=0.01 ) and were more likely than patients negative for hmpv and rsv to exhibit signs of otitis media ( 18.8% vs. 4.8%  p=0.02 ) .

 hmpv was the second most commonly identified respiratory virus during the respiratory season of 20062007 in our study . 
 our results confirm the previous findings that children with symptomatic hmpv infection are older than those infected with rsv  possibly because of differences in the upper respiratory tract or lung anatomy of older children that allow for hmpv acquisition . in our study  
 although a previous report found that hmpv is a rare cause of community - acquired pneumonia among hospitalized patients ( 4.9% )  37.5% of our hmpv - positive patients were admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia . 
 this difference is likely because of a requirement of three independent radiologists interpretations of the radiographs in the earlier study compared to the diagnosis of one admitting physician in our study . 
 hmpv - positive patients were more likely than the other two groups to have peribronchial cuffing on their chest radiographs  evidence suggesting that these patients have interstitial edema  likely a result of the disruption of the respiratory epithelial structure and inflammation that hmpv has been shown to cause in animal studies . 
 hmpv may have a stronger predilection for the respiratory epithelial cells than rsv  corroborated by reports that hmpv - positive patients frequently exhibited signs of otitis media . 
 further research is needed on the pathogenesis of hmpv in humans  specifically regarding the ability of hmpv to infect human respiratory epithelial cells compared to rsv and other viruses . 
 the present study demonstrates  as previously reported  that hmpv - positive patients were as likely to be severely ill as were rsv - positive patients . 
 in fact  in our study  hmpv - positive patients were more likely than rsv - positive patients to be admitted to the icu even though they were not more likely to have an underlying medical illness . 
 in addition  hmpv - positive patients were more likely than were rsv - positive patients to receive antibiotics . during the study time period  our institution did not routinely test specimens for hmpv . 
 physicians may have used antibiotics more often in patients only retrospectively shown to be hmpv - positive because they were not aware of a specific virus contributing to these patients illnesses . 
 the finding of increased antibiotic use in children with other aris  most of whom had negative viral cultures  corroborates this suggestion . 
 it is also possible that the increased diagnosis of pneumonia in the hmpv - positive patients contributed to the increased use of antibiotics . 
 this study  however  shows that there may be subtle differences in the clinical features of hmpv and rsv infections . as previously reported  fever was the most common presenting symptom for hmpv - positive patients and was more common in hmpv - positive children than in the other two groups . 
 hmpv - positive patients were also more likely to experience decreased urinary output than patients negative for hmpv and rsv . 
 more information is needed to compare the level of inflammation produced by hmpv with that of other viruses . 
 our study was limited by extraction of the data from a convenience sample and by the fact that only one respiratory viral season was studied . 
 in addition  the signs and symptoms associated with the studied viruses may have been exaggerated as only hospitalized patients were included . 
 lastly  we acknowledge the li mi tations associated with the use of different methods for detecting different viruses in our study . 
 the real - time asr assay that we used to detect hmpv was likely more sensitive than the dfa- and culture - based techniques used to detect rsv and other viruses . 
 as such  it is possible that children infected with rsv were assigned to the group of patients not infected with hmpv or rsv . 
 even with this potential drawback  however  our data strongly suggest that hmpv was common in the patient population included in this study . furthermore  
 as molecular methods gain more widespread use for the detection of many respiratory pathogens  continued studies assessing the correlation between laboratory and clinical information are warranted . 
 our study confirms that hmpv is a significant pathogen particularly in young children and is frequently associated with respiratory symptoms resulting in hospitalization . in general  the clinical manifestations of hmpv- and rsv - associated infections in children are similar  although our data suggest subtle differences in illness presentation but not in severity . 
 our data also suggest that underidentification of children with hmpv may lead to inappropriate use of antibiotics . 
 therefore  considering the high prevalence of hmpv  the severity of hmpv illness  and the ease and accuracy of detection  routine diagnostic testing for hmpv should be implemented . 
 increasingly  hmpv is being recognized as a significant cause of disease in other populations such as elderly patients and immunocompromised cases  highlighting other groups that would likely benefit from routine testing for hmpv . 
 future studies with expanded patient populations will help to determine how identifying cases with hmpv - associated disease will allow clinicians to anticipate the patient s clinical course  identify cohort patients appropriately  and decrease the use of unnecessary antibiotics .","

Abstract:
This study aimed to understand human metapneumovirus (hmpv) associated illness in children through a retrospective review of medical records. Results showed hmpv as the second most commonly identified virus after rsv, with similar severity and slightly older patients. Routine screening should be implemented due to the prevalence and severity of illness.

Research and Discussion:
By studying hmpv-associated illness, this study found that it is a major pathogen that can lead to hospitalization in children. This virus was compared to the commonly known respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), with similar clinical characteristics. Routine screening for hmpv should be considered due to its prevalence and the severity of illness it can cause.

Results and Conclusion:
Among hmpv-positive patients, pneumonia and bronchiolitis were common, while peribronchial cuffing, antibiotic treatment and ICU admission were also observed. This virus was identified as the second most commonly found after rsv, with a slightly older patient population. In conclusion, hmpv is a significant cause of hospitalization and routine screening should be implemented."
"recent whole transcriptome studies have revealed that about three quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed  while protein - coding regions account for just 2% of the genome ( 13 ) . 
 therefore  the vast majority of transcribed sequences do not encode proteins  and are called non - coding rna ( ncrna ) . 
 accumulating evidence shows that non - coding rnas play key roles in various biological processes  such as imprinting control  the circuitry controlling pluripotency and differentiation  immune responses  and chromosome dynamics ( 4 ) . 
 ncrnas are as important as protein - coding genes to cellular functions ( 56 ) . 
 notably  a growing number of long ncrnas ( lncrnas )  which are considered to be > 200 nt in length and are often multiexonic ( 7 )  have been implicated in disease etiology ( 810 ) . 
 it is therefore of great importance to collect lncrna information and store this information in a one - stop knowledge gateway for lncrnas  the noncode database . 
 the development of high - throughput sequencing methodologies has reduced the cost of rna sequencing  and as a result there has been an explosive rise in the number of newly identified lncrnas . 
 established a consensus set of 384 066 predicted transcripts from 7256 rna - seq libraries  which were designated as the mitranscriptome assembly ( 11 ) . since then the revolutionary advancement of sequencing methods  such as single - molecule long - read techniques  leads us closer to the real lncrna transcriptome . given sufficient material  amplification - free sequencing of full - length cdna molecules 
 noncode has collected data from literature published since the last update and includes the latest versions of several public databases ( ensembl ( 13 )  refseq(14 )  lncrnadb ( 15 ) and gencode ( 16 ) ) . 
 after the removal of false and redundant lncrnas  noncode contains a total of 527336 transcripts . 
 in addition to the identification of new lncrnas  data on the genetics and biochemical properties of lncrnas has accumulated rapidly . of the papers retrieved from pubmed for lncrnas 
  we found that the vast majority studied lncrna function  especially the relationship between lncrnas and disease ( 810 ) . 
 in large - scale searches for single - base differences between diseased and healthy individuals  about 40% of the disease - related differences show up in genomic regions outside of protein - coding genes . 
 this implicates non - coding regions as vital for genetic risk factors of disease ( 2 ) . in order to enable a systematic compilation and integration of this information 
 the sources for these annotations were derived from literature mining  differential lncrna analysis utilizing public rna - seq data and microarray data and mutation analysis from public genome - wide association study ( gwas ) data . along with the ever increasing number of lncrnas and the amount and functional study data  genome - wide conservation information is required for biologists to study the mechanisms of lncrna actions . in order to explore the conservation information of lncrnas  noncode collected six new mammalian species ( chimpanzee  gorilla  orangutan  rhesus macaque  opossum and platypus ) ( 17 ) . 
 users can browse the conserved counterparts of any human lncrna gene in other species through a phylogenetic tree layout . 
 similar to the former iterations of noncode ( 1821 )  the source of noncode 2016 includes the previous versions of noncode  the collated literature and other public databases .

 we retrieved the newly identified lncrnas and their annotations from the supplementary material or web site of these articles . 
 together with the newest data from ensembl  refseq  lncrnadb  gencode and the old versions of noncode data  literature data were processed through a standard pipeline for each species . 
 all of the input data were processed into bed or gtf formats based on one assembly version  for example  hg38 for human and mm10 for mouse.combination .

 more annotation information has been added and a more user - friendly interface has been introduced . 
 noncode contains 527336 lncrna transcripts from 16 species ( human  mouse  cow  rat  chimpanzee  gorilla  orangutan  rhesus macaque  opossum  platypus  chicken  zebrafish  fruitfly  caenorhabditiselegans  yeast and arabidopsis  ) . according to the definition of lncrna genes ( 18 )  
 a total of 101700 and 86935 genes were generated from 167150 and 130558 lncrnas from human and mouse ( shown in table 1 )  respectively . 
 following the nomenclature of noncode v4 ( 18 )  both lncrna transcripts and genes were designated systematically : non+ three characters ( representing a species ) + t ( transcript ) or g ( gene ) + six sequential numbers . 
 noncode has annotated expression profiles from all the human and mouse transcripts and genes  and a large number of these genes were annotated with predicted functions . 
 definitive evidence has proven that transcription of the non - coding genome has produced functional rnas ( 1 ) . in particular  lncrnas have been implicated in biological  developmental  and pathological processes  and acted through mechanisms such as chromatin reprogramming  cis regulation at enhancers  and post - transcriptional regulation of mrna processing ( 28 ) . 
 lncrnas are therefore considered to be important regulators of tissue physiology and disease processes including cancer ( 11 ) . 
 although we have collected functional interactions between ncrnas and biomolecules in npinter ( 2931 )  we think it is also necessary to include disease information into noncode . 
 recent published papers have been explored  and the proven associations between noncode transcripts and diseases has been integrated into the latest version . 
 the noncode assembly also assessed the overlaps of transcripts with the unique disease - associated single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) from a catalog of gwass ( 32 ) and the snp database ( dbsnp ) ( 33 ) . 
 there were also a lot of relational data between lncrnas and diseases which were analyzed from rna - seq and microarray data . 
 after collecting the basic data  we compared it with the lncrnas in noncode and retained data that overlapped with noncode lncrnas . 
 noncode 2016 contains 1110 lncrnas which were related to 284 diseases . among these associations  
 disease related data acquisition pipeline in the lncrna gene description pages  users can retrieve the related diseases of the entry  and also get the source of the information  such as the pmid(s ) of the reference paper(s ) . 
 there is also mutational information retrieved from the literature  gwass and the dbsnp database . 
 compared to protein - coding genes and small rnas ( e.g. mirnas and snornas )  several reports have suggested that lncrnas are modestly conserved ( 11 ) . 
 most lncrnas are less conserved in sequence ( 34 )  but there are still many lncrnas that are conserved in their genomic loci  exonic sequences and promoter regions ( 35 ) . 
 these are preserved across multiple species  attesting to their important functional potentials ( 36 ) . 
 benefiting from next - generation sequencing technologies  ncrnas are now more easily identied via transcript sequencing . 
 noncode has added six new species  mainly from multi - species rna - seq data ( 3738 ) . 
 an evolutionary tree from 12 commonly studied species ( human  mouse  cow  rat  chicken  zebrafish  chimpanzee  gorilla  orangutan  rhesus macaque  opossum and platypus ) was constructed using methods introduced in phylononcode ( 39 ) . 
 each human lncrna gene counterpart from the other listed species can be retrieved through browsing the evolutionary tree ( shown in figure 2 ) . 
 the counterpart of each lncrna was computed using the ucsc liftover tool ( 40 ) . in brief  liftover utilized blastz ( 41 )  an independent implementation of the gapped blast algorithm specifically designed for aligning two long genomic sequences  as a core algorithm to detect homologous regions in other genomes . after mapping to the second species  
 however  a proper method of in silico transcript reconstruction is an ongoing challenge . according to an assessment by the paul bertone group  < 40% of known transcripts 
 the complexity of higher eukaryotic genomes imposes severe limitations on transcript recall and splice product discrimination that are likely to remain limiting factors for the analysis of current - generation rna - seq data ( 42 ) . 
 furthermore  multiple amplification steps during library preparation complicate the quantification of expression levels . to some extent 
 given sufficient material  amplification - free and fragmentation - free sequencing of full - length cdna molecules provides a more direct view of rna molecules ( 12 ) . 
 noncode contacted the authors of the third - generation single - molecule long - read survey of the human transcriptome paper ( 12 ) . 
 after our analysis  the single - molecule lncrna transcripts were included into noncode . to meet the quality demands of researchers 
 users can choose the subset which is considered high quality . the quality controls include the source of the data  literature support  other database support and long - read sequencing method support . 
 the controls also include selection of exon numbers  the lengths of the transcripts and prediction tools support . 
 the web interface will return the subset according to the conditions users chose and allow users to download the data . 
 noncode 2016 contains 527336 lncrnas from 16 different species  this compares favorably with other lncrna databases . 
 for example  lncipedia ( human only ) contains 111 685 transcripts ( 43 )  lncrnator ( human  mouse  fly  zebrafish  worm and yeast ) contains 34 605 transcripts ( 44 )  while the lncrnawiki ( human only ) contains 105 255 transcripts ( 45 ) . as mentioned above  technical limitations imposed by short - read sequencing lead to a number of computational challenges in transcript reconstruction and quantification . for many transcripts  
 automated methods failed to identify all of the constituent exons  and in cases in which all exons were reported  the protocols tested often failed to assemble the exons into complete isoforms ( 42 ) . 
 for example  although we have obtained all the data from mitranscriptome ( 11 )  which contains 384 066 human lncrnas from 7256 rna - seq libraries  the detection of precise refseq splicing patterns from mitranscriptome was only 31%  and the fraction of annotated genes within the entire mitranscriptome was only 46% . 
 although it is reasonable to assume that unannotated transcription is unique to specific lineages  the low refseq detection rate was unusual . 
 we therefore made a decision that noncode would not include mitranscriptome data in the current version . in the future 
  we will attempt to make clear the real reason(s ) . perhaps a more comprehensive construction tool is required to answer this question .

"the chemical modification of proteins 
 is an established tool for 
 studying the structure  function  and regulation of this class of 
 biopolymer . 
 moreover  in recent years  
 a great deal of effort has been directed toward the modification of 
 proteins for therapeutic applications . 
 traditionally  protein conjugation chemistries have exploited the 
 reactivity of surface - exposed nucleophilic amino acids  such as cysteine 
 or lysine  however  these methods typically result in heterogeneous 
 mixtures of products  which can complicate biological studies or efficacious 
 medicinal applications . to address this concern  
 several strategies 
 have been developed for the site - specific modification of proteins  
 ranging from total chemical synthesis ( usually via native chemical 
 ligation  ncl ) to the genetic incorporation 
 of unnatural amino acids or bio - orthogonal 
 functional groups . in between these two 
 extremes 
 the most 
 widely used protein semisynthesis technique is an extension 
 of ncl termed expressed protein ligation ( epl ) in which a recombinant 
 protein -thioester building block is ligated to a synthetic 
 molecule equipped with a 12-aminothiol moiety ( most commonly an n - terminal 
 cys - containing peptide ) through the formation of a native peptide 
 bond ( scheme 1 ) . since 
 its inception 
  epl has been applied to a wide variety of proteins  
 including enzymes  ion channels  transcription factors  transmembrane receptors  and antibodies ( for reviews see refs ( 15 and 16 ) ) . 
 one of the basic requirements 
 of epl is a thioester group at the c - terminus of a recombinant protein . 
 this reactive handle is introduced by exploiting a process known as 
 protein splicing ( scheme 1 )  which is mediated 
 by an autoprocessing domain called an intein . 
 protein splicing typically takes place through the formation of 
 one or more protein thioester intermediates  which ultimately resolve 
 to form a native peptide bond between the sequences flanking the intein 
 ( referred to as n- and c - exteins ) . by using appropriate intein mutants  
 it is possible to intercept these intermediates with exogenous thiols  
 resulting in an n - extein of choice being cleaved from the mutant intein 
 as a reactive -thioester derivative suitable for chemical ligation . 
 int and int represent n- and c - intein fragments  respectively . despite the many successes of epl  the approach 
 often suffers from 
 low overall efficiency due to complications associated with the generation 
 of protein -thioesters . 
 in particular  fusions to inteins are  
 to varying extents  susceptible to premature extein cleavage  both in vivo and during initial purification from cell lysates  
 which reduces the isolated yield of the intein fusion needed for the 
 subsequent thiolysis step . 
 importantly  
 the cleaved extein side - product is unreactive toward epl  and its 
 separation from the desired -thioester or the ligation product 
 is often difficult for large proteins  such as antibodies . to compound matters  
 the thiolysis reaction 
 itself can be slow and inefficient  further strengthening the need 
 to develop customized purification regimes  involving multiple chromatographic 
 steps  to isolate the desired product from complex mixtures . 
 collectively  these technical issues mean that a considerable investment 
 in time and resources is usually required before a semisynthetic protein 
 is obtained in useful quantities . 
 ( a ) 
 schematic of the procedure 
 for the isolation of an -thioester derivative of a protein 
 of interest ( poi ) using engineered split intein fragments ( int and int ) . 
 epl can be performed in a one - pot fashion 
 during thiolysis from the split intein or immediately after elution  
 without need of any further purification . 
 ( b ) sequences of npu ( wt ) and the npuaa mutant used on the split intein 
 column . 
 catalytic residues mutated in npuaa are shown 
 in bold  and the linker sequence added for immobilization onto the 
 solid support is underlined . 
 sequences are numbered according to the 
 intein sequence alignment shown in figure s2 . to overcome the various drawbacks 
 associated with 
 the intein thiolysis 
 process central to epl  we envisioned an alternative strategy based 
 on naturally occurring split inteins . unlike inteins used in standard 
 epl  which are contiguous polypeptides that catalyze protein splicing 
 in cis  split 
 inteins consist of two discrete polypeptides  
 herein termed int and int  which  upon association  
 catalyze protein splicing in trans ( protein trans - splicing  pts  scheme 1 ) . 
 split inteins have two important properties 
 that make them attractive for an improved epl strategy . 
 first  cognate 
 int and int pairs often bind tightly to one 
 another ; dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range  reflecting 
 extremely fast on - rates  have been reported for members of the naturally 
 split dnae inteins from cyanobacteria . 
 this ability 
 of split inteins to self - associate has recently been exploited by 
 lu et al . as part of a traceless protein purification system  in this 
 case using an artificially split intein pair . 
 the potential utility of split inteins in epl is further enhanced 
 by the remarkable splicing efficiency of some members of the family . 
 for instance  many of the split dnae inteins have half - lives for 
 the splicing reaction of less than a minute  as compared to several 
 hours in the case of the cis - splicing inteins commonly 
 used in epl . 
 moreover  recent mechanistic 
 investigations indicate that these  ultrafast  dnae 
 inteins have a highly activated n - terminal splice junction  making 
 them superior reagents for protein -thioester generation . given the unique properties of split inteins  
 in particular  the ultrafast split dnae inteins  we conceived the 
 integrated protein modification system shown in figure 1 in which the split intein association is employed both to 
 purify the desired protein from complex biological mixtures and to 
 trigger the generation of a desired protein -thioester for 
 epl . in principle 
  this complementation system should address the 
 major issues attendant to the standard epl protocol  including premature 
 cleavage of the intein  which can not occur in the case of a split 
 intein fragment absent its cognate partner . 
 to implement 
 our system  we designed a mutant of the ultrafast nostoc 
 punctiforme ( npu ) split dnae intein suitable for efficient 
 -thioester generation . specifically  we mutated the catalytic 
 c - terminal residue in the int fragment ( asn137 ) and the 
 first residue in the c - extein ( cys+1 ) to ala  to allow for efficient 
 build up of the desired splicing intermediates upon exposure to an 
 n - extein - npu fusion ( figure 1 ) . 
 preliminary studies showed that mixing n - extein - npu fusions 
 ( where n - extein corresponded to various model proteins ) with the mutant 
 npu ( npuaa ) led to highly efficient n - extein 
 -thioester formation in a thiol - dependent manner ( figures s3 and s4 ) . 
 importantly  only very low 
 levels of intein cleavage ( i.e.  unwanted hydrolysis ) were observed 
 in the absence of thiols  thereby fulfilling a requirement of our 
 integrated strategy . encouraged by these results  we adapted 
 the system for the one - pot purification and generation of c - terminally 
 modified proteins by taking full advantage of the strong and specific 
 interaction between the split intein fragments . 
 accordingly  the npuaa peptide was immobilized on a solid support through a unique 
 cys residue engineered within its c - extein region ( figure s5 ) . the resulting npuaa column ( hereafter 
 referred to as int column ) was then evaluated as an affinity - modification 
 resin . 
 three test proteins maltose binding protein ( mbp )  ubiquitin 
 ( ub )  and protein histidine phosphatase type 1 ( phpt1 ) were genetically 
 fused to npu and expressed in escherichia 
 coli . in each case  cells were lysed  and the soluble 
 fraction was loaded onto the int column to allow binding 
 of the npu tagged protein to the immobilized npuaa . 
 after a brief incubation (  5 min at rt ) the column was 
 extensively washed to remove contaminants  and thiolysis was triggered 
 by addition of a buffer containing the thiol  mercaptoethansulfonate 
 ( mes ) . in all three cases  the desired -thioester protein eluted 
 from the int column with high recovery ( 7595% ) 
 and high purity ( 95% as determined by rp - hplc and mass spectrometry ) 
 ( figure 2 ) . 
 total isolated yields of purified 
 protein -thioesters varied from one protein to another and 
 ranged from 2.5 mg ( per l of bacterial culture ) for ub - mes to 40 mg 
 for mbp - mes . 
 the calculated loading capacity of the int column used in these experiments was 36 mg of protein per 
 ml of beads ( 0.12 mols / ml )  but higher or lower loadings could 
 easily be achieved by modifying the amount of npu - aa immobilized 
 on the solid support . 
 furthermore  we showed that the int column could be regenerated and reused at least 5 times with only 
 minimal loss of capacity ( figures s11 and s12 ) . 
 the utility of the -thioester derivatives of ub  mbp  and 
 phpt1 obtained from the column was demonstrated by ligating each of 
 them to an n - terminal cys - containing fluorescent peptide ( cgk(fl ) ) 
 to give the corresponding semisynthetic products in excellent yield 
 ( figure s10 ) . 
 importantly  one - pot thiolysis / ligation 
 reactions could be carried out  which allowed us to obtain a site - specifically 
 modified protein directly from cell lysates without isolating the 
 intermediate thioester ( figure 3 ) . 
 ( a ) mbp  ( b ) phpt1  and ( c ) ub mercaptoethansulfonate 
 ( mes ) -thioesters were purified in one step from e. coli cell lysates using the int column . 
 the purifications were monitored by coomassie stained sds - page analysis 
 ( top ) ( inp : input  ft : column flow - through  w1 - 3 : washes  e1 - 4 : elutions  
 and bds : resin beads ) . 
 rp - hplc ( detection at 214 nm ) and esi - tof ms 
 analysis of the eluted fractions ( bottom left and right  respectively ) 
 confirmed the identity of all protein -thioesters and indicated 
 high purity . 
 one - pot purification / ligation of ubiquitin to the h - cgk(fluorescein)-nh2 peptide ( cgk(fl ) ) . 
 ub - npu from e. coli cell lysates was bound to the int column  as shown in figure 2  and after removal 
 of contaminants through extensive washes  intein cleavage and ligation 
 were triggered by addition of 200 mm mes and 1 mm cgk(fl ) peptide . 
 coomassie stained sds - page analysis and in gel fluorescence of the 
 purification / ligation ( left ) . 
 rp - hplc ( detection at 214 and 440 nm ) 
 and esi - tof ms ( right ) of the eluted fractions confirm the desired 
 ligated protein was obtained in one step directly from cell lysates 
 with a ligation yield close to 95% ( quantified by rp - hplc ) . 
 an attractive feature of epl is that it can allow for the preparation 
 of site - specifically modified proteins in a virtually traceless manner . 
 this is contingent on the ability to efficiently generate recombinant 
 protein -thioesters when any of the 20 proteinogenic amino 
 acids are present at the c - terminus of the protein . 
 the activity of 
 split inteins is known to be sensitive to the identity of the amino 
 acids immediately flanking the splice junction . 
 thus  we were eager to test the generality 
 of our strategy and asked whether we could generate -thioesters 
 of all 20 amino acids  using ubiquitin as the n - extein template . 
 twenty 
 ub - npu fusion proteins were individually expressed in e. coli and purified over the int column 
 as before . 
 thiol - induced cleavage yields from the solid support were 
 determined by sds - page analysis of the eluted and resin beads fractions  
 and levels of competing side reactions ( mainly hydrolysis ) were measured 
 by rp - hplc and esi - tof ms . 
 the results clearly show that for most 
 amino acids > 60% of the bound proteins were recovered after mes 
 treatment . 
 furthermore  8095% of the eluted material was the desired 
 -thioester product . 
 the only exceptions were pro and glu  for 
 which recovery were 49 and 50%  respectively ( figure 4 ) . 
 the asn mutant displayed high levels of cleavage from the 
 split intein  but almost no -thioester could be isolated due 
 to side - chain cyclization to form a c - terminal succinimide . 
 a second 
 problematic residue was asp  for which we observed some premature 
 cleavage during initial binding to the int resin . 
 moreover  
 rp - hplc analysis of the eluted fractions upon thiolysis revealed two 
 species with the molecular weight of the desired -thioester . 
 these results were not wholly unexpected  as asp is known to cleave 
 prematurely from contiguous inteins through side - chain cyclization  and its -thioesters have been reported to migrate to the 
 side - chain carboxylate yielding mixtures of - and -isomers . 
 these minor constraints aside  it is clear from 
 these studies that our streamlined epl system is compatible when the 
 majority of amino acids are present as the last residue in the protein 
 of interest . 
 the 20 mutants of the protein ub - x - npu were expressed 
 in e. coli varying the identity of 
 the c - terminal amino acid of ub ( x ) from the wt gly to all other proteinogenic 
 amino acids . 
 thiol - induced cleavage yields from the int column were calculated from the sds - page analysis of the eluted 
 fractions and left over resin beads . 
 ratios of -thioester vs 
 side products were determined from rp - hplc and esi - tof ms analysis 
 of the eluted fractions . 
 the major competing reaction for all amino 
 acids was hydrolysis with the exception of asn for which its succinimide 
 form was isolated instead . * 
 protein semisynthesis frequently requires the preparation of protein 
 fragments  which are often poorly behaved and need to be purified 
 in the presence of strong chaotropic agents . 
 we first confirmed that 
 the model protein ub - npu could bind the int column in the presence of 2 and 4 m urea and that the corresponding 
 ub -thioester could be generated with similar yields as obtained 
 under native conditions ( figure s14 ) . 
 this 
 is consistent with a previous study  which demonstrated npu dnae could 
 splice in the presence of high concentration of denaturants . 
 we then turned to a more challenging target  
 namely a fragment of histone h2b ( residues 1116 )  a polypeptide 
 that is prone to aggregation and difficult to generate as an -thioester 
 derivative using standard epl procedures . 
 we expressed human histone h2b(1116 ) fused to npu in e. coli  extracted it from inclusion 
 bodies in 6 m urea  and diluted it to 2 m urea prior to loading on 
 the int - intein column . 
 the incubation was performed for 
 3 h at ph 6.0 to maximize binding while avoiding premature cleavage 
 through hydrolysis . 
 the ph was then raised to 7.2  and thiolysis was 
 carried out for 36 h at rt ( note that the presence of the denaturant 
 slows down the thiolysis rate ) . using these conditions  
 hh2b(1116)-mes 
 was obtained in excellent purity ( > 90% by rp - hplc ) and isolated 
 yield 
 ( 20 mg per l of culture ) . 
 this represents a significant improvement 
 over previous protocols which afford less protein ( 4 mg per l of culture ) 
 and require the use of multiple chromatographic purification steps 
 including rp - hplc . 
 importantly  the hh2b(1116)-mes 
 thioester obtained from the int column could be directly 
 used in epl reactions without further purification . 
 accordingly  we 
 successfully ligated the protein to a hh2b(117125 ) peptide 
 containing an acetylated lys at position 120 to yield semisynthetic hh2b - k120ac ( figure 5 ) .

 e1e3 
 were collected after 18 h of incubation with mes and e4e6 
 after an additional 18 h. e1e6 were pooled  concentrated to 
 150 m  and ligated to the peptide h - cvtk(ac)ytsak - oh at 1 mm 
 for 3 h at rt . 
 ( b ) rp - hplc ( left ) of the ligation reaction mixture 
 and ms ( right ) of the ligated hh2b - k120ac product . 
 finally  we tested our streamlined epl methodology for the modification 
 of a monoclonal antibody . 
 the site - specific modification of antibodies 
 has become highly desirable in the area of biopharmaceuticals and 
 diagnostics . 
 currently  most commercially 
 utilized methods to conjugate cargo to antibodies are relatively nonspecific 
 and result in polydisperse mixtures that may vary from batch - to - batch . 
 since this heterogeneity can adversely affect both efficacy and safety 
 of the conjugate 
 indeed  protein semisynthesis via standard epl and pts has recently 
 been used to generate monoclonal antibody conjugates with full activity . given this  we were eager to see whether our 
 streamlined epl process could be used in the facile generation of 
 antibody conjugates . 
 as a model immunoglobulin ( igg ) for our studies  
 we used an antibody against the dec205 receptor  a c - type lectin found 
 predominantly on dendritic cells . 
 accordingly  
 we designed a construct in which npu was fused to the 
 c - terminus of the heavy chain of the antibody ( dec205-npu ) . 
 initial expression tests of dec205-npu in 293 t cells resulted in very low levels of the antibody being 
 secreted ( figure 6a ) . 
 we have observed previously 
 that the identity of the int can have an effect on expression 
 levels of its fusions . 
 consequently  
 we asked whether we could obtain higher levels of secreted dec205-int by varying the identity of the intein n - fragment . 
 several 
 new dec205-int constructs were generated in which 
 int corresponded to the n - fragment of a series of ultrafast 
 split dnae inteins  namely  ava  csp  cra  cwa  mcht  oli  and ter . 
 we also tested an npu mutant ( c - s ) where the noncatalytic 
 cysteines  cys28 and cys59  were mutated to ser  to determine whether 
 these residues influence secretion and maturation of the igg tetramer 
 ( figure 6a ) . 
 importantly  each of the int fragments in this set can cross - react with the c - fragment 
 of npu without significant loss of splicing efficiency . 
 thus  the int column already in 
 hand is compatible with all of these dec205-int fusions . 
 the contiguous mxe gyra intein was also fused to dec205 
 to test whether the use of n - intein fragments negatively affected 
 expression levels compared to a full - length intein . 
 an expression 
 screen of this dec205-int library was performed 
 in 293 t cells  revealing that the ava and csp fusions reproducibly exhibited higher expression levels than the 
 other n - inteins  with the former being the best . 
 indeed  the expression 
 levels of the dec - ava construct were at least as 
 good as the dec - gyra construct . based on this  
 the dec205-ava fusion was chosen and purified over the int column 
 in an analogous manner to that of the soluble proteins described above 
 ( figure 6b ) . 
 elutions from the column contained 
 the thiolyzed dec205  which was subsequently ligated to the 
 cgk(fl ) peptide ( figure 6c ) . 
 size exclusion 
 chromatography ( sec ) coupled to multiple angle light scattering ( mals ) 
 analysis confirmed that the antibody retained its tetrameric folded 
 state after thiolysis and ligation ( figure 6d ) . 
 we also performed ms analysis of the deglycosylated and fully 
 reduced antibody  which confirmed the formation of a stable  nonreducible 
 amide bond between the dec205 heavy chain and the fluorescent 
 peptide with a 75% yield ( figure 6e ) . importantly 
  
 we demonstrated that the semisynthetic dec - cgk(fl ) retains 
 its ability to bind the dec205 receptor to the same extent as a control 
 dec205  previously shown to be fully functional in 
 vivo(46 ) ( figure 7 ) . 
 binding of dec - cgk(fl ) to the dec205 receptor could 
 be monitored not only by flow cytometry using an antimouse igg secondary 
 antibody ( figure 7 ) but also through the site - specifically 
 incorporated fluorescein ( figure s20 ) . 
 purification 
 of a monoclonal antibody -thioester using a 
 split intein and its site - specific modification .

 and different split dnae inteins through the c - terminus of its heavy

 and ligation ( mw = 151 kda  mw calcd = 148 kda ) .

 and fully reduced hc after ligation  showing 75% of the hc is labeled . 
 ( a ) dose 
 dependent binding of dec205-cgk(fl ) to cho cells expressing 
 the mouse dec205 receptor monitored by flow cytometry using a pe - labeled 
 -mouse igg . 
 binding to control cho / neo cells  which do not 
 express the receptor is shown in gray . 
 ( b ) as in ( a ) but using a control 
 -dec205 antibody . 
 we have shown that split dnae inteins can 
 be engineered for the 
 efficient generation and isolation of protein -thioesters . 
 furthermore  the strategy can be seamlessly integrated with epl  and 
 one pot purification / ligations can be performed without isolation 
 of the -thioester intermediates . 
 we note  however  that the 
 ligation step ( i.e.  ncl ) still requires the use of high concentrations 
 ( high m or above ) of n - terminal cysteine peptide for efficient 
 reactions . the strong and specific interaction between the two intein 
 fragments facilitates the purification of protein -thioesters 
 under a variety of conditions  including strong denaturants  and the 
 isolation of these products directly from cell lysates proceeds significantly 
 faster than via many mainstream epl strategies  which often take multiple 
 days and several intermediate enrichment / purification steps . 
 additionally  
 while split intein fusions are usually associated with low levels 
 of expression  we show here that certain dnae int fragments 
 express to the same levels as commonly used contiguous inteins when 
 fused to a monoclonal ab . 
 moreover  the absence of premature cleavage 
 events allowed us to generate semisynthetic proteins  such as h2b - k120ac 
 in far superior yields than those of previously established protocols . 
 importantly  we have shown the utility of this methodology for the 
 modification of complex biomolecules such as an igg . 
 thus  streamlined 
 epl via our split dnae intein column should provide an efficient route 
 to site - specifically modified proteins for basic biochemical research 
 as well as translational applications .

1) Abstract: Chemically modified proteins play a crucial role in studying biological processes and have potential as therapeutic agents. A new method using engineered DNAe inteins for generating recombinant protein-thioesters was developed. This streamlined procedure was successfully applied for semisynthesis of proteins including an acetylated histone and a modified monoclonal antibody.

2) Research and Discussion: Expressed protein ligation (EPL) is a widely used method for site-specific modification of proteins. However, the generation and isolation of required recombinant protein-thioesters can be challenging. This study presents a new approach using engineered versions of naturally split DNAe inteins. These autoprocessing enzymes offer faster kinetics and a streamlined purification process for generating protein-thioesters.

3) Results and Conclusion: The new method for preparing and purifying protein-thioesters using engineered DNAe inteins showed promising results. This method was successfully applied for the semisynthesis of acetylated histone and site-specifically modified monoclonal antibody. The strong affinity between the two split intein fragments facilitated a streamlined purification process, making it a valuable tool for protein modification studies and potential therapeutic applications."
"ameloblastoma is a benign but locally aggressive neoplasm of the odontogenic epithelium.1 accounting for 11% of all odontogenic tumors  ameloblastoma is the most common odontogenic neoplasm affecting the jaws  yet it only accounts for 1% of all tumors of the maxilla and mandible.24 the average age of patients presenting with ameloblastoma is 36 years  with men and women being equally affected.5 ameloblastomas are classified as solid / multicystic  intraosseous  or unicystic  with peripheral subtypes.67 the radiographic appearance of ameloblastoma  dentigerous cysts  and odontogenic keratocysts is similar and for this reason a biopsy is recommended to obtain a precise diagnosis of ameloblastoma.8 although a benign tumor  ameloblastoma is aggressive because of the myeline nature of its growth and because its conservative treatment is associated with a high rate of recurrence ( 50%90% ) . 
 primary resection of this benign tumor is  therefore  considered the only predictable curative form of therapy.711 unfortunately  this treatment leaves the patient with a defect in the affected region of the jaw . 
 a multi - disciplinary approach is needed for the patient s complete rehabilitation  including bone grafting  the planned placement of implant  and the prosthetic work . 
 sometimes the orthodontist s role in this multidisciplinary approach is to create an optimum occlusal relationship and sufficient space to allow for successful reconstruction of the affected region of the jaw .

 the problem list for this patient included the presence of a class i malocclusion characterized by a condition of moderate crowding in the anterior region of both dental arches  a labially positioned mandibular right canine  a mild deviation of the mandibular dental arch midline to the right  a moderate tooth size discrepancy  and an edentulous space in the right posterior area of the mandible due to the extractions of the right premolars and first molar .

 ameloblastoma is a benign odontogenic tumor arising from the residual epithelial components of tooth development . 
 it is a slow growing  locally aggressive tumor capable of causing facial deformity  with a high recurrence rate due its capacity to infiltrate trabecular bone . 
 bone grafts replace the surgically removed bone  with autologous bone grafting being the most desirable . 
 it is typically harvested from intraoral sources ( e.g.  chin ) or extraoral sources ( e.g.  iliac crest  fibula  calvarial bone ) . 
 the most commonly used graft material for alveolar ridge reconstruction is free autogenous iliac bone.12 in this case  however  autologous calvarial bone grafts were used to reconstruct the missing mandibular bone following the surgical resection of the tumor and the removal of three teeth in the region . 
 the advantages of calvarial bone grafting include good integration  absence of pain from the donor site  and no visible scar . 
 these advantages  however  are not applicable in the case of thin calvaria bone with a thickness of less than 5 mm.12 recent reports on the use of calvarial bone grafting for the reconstruction and subsequent placement of dental implants have presented good clinical outcomes  with low rates of graft resorption and high implant survival rates.1316 the results of these studies have showed that calvarial bone grafting appears to be less prone to resorption than iliac grafts are . in this case  
 this goal could have been achieved by the placement of two implants and a bridge  replacing all three teeth . however 
  this treatment plan would not have addressed the patient s chief complaint  nor would it result in optimum functionality and esthetics . 
 accordingly  the placement of the two implants was decided in relation to the orthodontic treatment plan  aiming for an optimum result . 
 the two implants were placed in the posterior region of the edentulous area  hence replacing only two of the missing teeth  with the extra space being used to correct crowding and to improve dental occlusion . 
 the outcome of this interdisciplinary approach was the satisfactory restoration of both occlusal function and esthetics . 
 a multidisciplinary approach  including oral surgery  orthodontics  and prosthodontics was able to provide a patient diagnosed with follicular ameloblastoma in the right mandibular region with a satisfactory occlusion following partial mandibular resection and removal of adjacent teeth in the affected site .","

1) Abstract: This case report describes a successful combined treatment approach for an adult female patient with a history of follicular ameloblastoma. The treatment involved surgical removal of part of the mandible and immediate replacement with an autologous calvarial bone graft, followed by orthodontic treatment and prosthodontic rehabilitation.

2) Research and Discussion: The combination of surgical, orthodontic, and prosthodontic treatment was necessary to address occlusal disturbances and create space for two dental implants. The use of autologous calvarial bone graft was a successful method for immediate bone replacement. The close collaboration between the different dental specialties was crucial for the success of this complex case.

3) Results and Conclusion: The patient achieved proper occlusion and function with the final prosthodontic rehabilitation. The use of autologous calvarial bone graft allowed for successful and immediate bone replacement, and the involvement of multiple dental specialties was crucial for achieving optimal results. This case report highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in complex cases such as this one."
"the laparoscopic removal of a cervical stump following a supra cervical ( subtotal ) hysterectomy was first described by nezhat et al  and they concluded that the cervical stump could be removed laparoscopically by an experienced surgeon . 
 the advantages of the laparoscopic approach included possible stump adhesiolysis  providing adequate postoperative vault support  and assessment of the pelvic lymph nodes . 
 the 43-year - old  presented with a history of persistent p v discharge and occasional post - coital bleeding . 
 she had undergone subtotal hysterectomy in 1994  due to postpartum hemorrhage following a normal delivery . 
 a colposcopic biopsy done in january 2009  reported severe dysplasia of the cervix  with a human papillomavirus ( hpv ) effect and crypt extension . 
 there was a strong family history of cancer of the cervix  as her mother had succumbed to the disease . 
 on general examination she was in fair general condition  well - built and well - nourished  with adequate hydration . 
 the hemoglobin was 13.3 g / dl  blood sugar was 5.3 mmols / l  urea and electrolytes were normal . 
 an initial diagnosis of abnormal pap smear was entertained and the patient opted for a laparoscopic trachelectomy  with the option of a laparotomy  after discussing all her options . 
 there were dense adhesions in the pouch of douglas involving the bowel and the cervical stump . 
 the pelvic lymph nodes were clearly visualized ( after intracervical methylene blue injection ) and did not appear to be enlarged . 
 gentle adhesiolysis was undertaken using sharp dissection  bipolar cautery  and a harmonic scalpel . 
 the vaginal vault was subsequently opened over the ceramic cup of a clermont ferrand elevator . 
 a cystoscopy with retrograde ureteral catheterization  to confirm the integrity of the bladder and ureters  was undertaken . 
 the cervical stump after laparoscopic trachelectomy at one week of follow - up the patient was well . 
 a postoperative intravenous urogram ( ivu ) confirmed that both the ureters and bladder were intact . 
 subtotal hysterectomy was developed as a procedure in the 1990s  and is regarded as a safe option to total abdominal hysterectomy in the management of benign uterine conditions and in obstetrics  due to severe postpartum hemorrhage . 
 okaro et al  in an assessment of the long - term outcomes of laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy analyzed the case records of 70 consecutive women undergoing the procedure . 
 of these  24.3% ( 17 cases ) reported symptoms related to the cervical stump  within 14 months of the original surgery . 
 in his series 14 of these patients underwent laparoscopic trachelectomy  one had only laparoscopic adhesiolysis and two underwent a laparotomy with trachelectomy due to dense bowel adhesions on the cervical stump . 
 histologically the stumps showed endometriosis ( 23.5% ) and mild dysplasia in 7.6% of the patients . in this case our patient presented with persistent p v discharge and occasional post - coital bleeding . 
 the subsequent pap smears were abnormal . in a retrospective of 41 patients undergoing laparoscopic subtotal hysterectomy  van der stege et al  noted that 98% of the patients were satisfied with their procedure  with 10% of them having monthly spotting . 
 they concluded that although laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign diseases was a satisfactory procedure  special attention should be paid to careful management of the cervical stump . 
 hilger et al  reviewed the indications of 310 trachelectomies performed at the mayo clinic from 1974 to 2003 . 
 they included stump prolapse ( 4% )  fibroid mass ( 1% )  cervical dysplasia ( 6% )  carcinoma in situ ( 5% )  irregular bleeding ( 2% )  and cervicitis ( 53% ) . 
 the complications following vaginal trachelectomies were encountered in 80% of the procedures against 37% in the abdominal procedure . in our report the cervical stump confirmed carcinoma in situ .","

A pap smear and colposcopic biopsy revealed cervical dysplasia, leading to a laparoscopic trachelectomy which revealed early stage cervical cancer.

2) Research and Discussion:
The patient's history and current presentation raise concerns about the effectiveness of subtotal hysterectomy in treating postpartum hemorrhage and the risk of developing cervical dysplasia later in life. However, the use of laparoscopic trachelectomy as a surgical intervention in early stage cervical cancer has shown promising results and may be a viable option for preserving fertility.

3) Results and Conclusions:
The histology of the stump after laparoscopic trachelectomy confirmed the presence of cervical squamous carcinoma in situ, without microinvasion. This supports the use of laparoscopic trachelectomy as a successful treatment for early stage cervical cancer, and highlights the importance of routine follow-up after subtotal hysterectomy and postpartum care. Further research is needed to better assess the long-term outcomes and efficacy of laparoscopic trachelectomy in this population."
"biological membranes are mainly composed of phospholipids  sphingolipids  cholesterol  and membrane - associated proteins . these molecules are nonhomogeneously distributed in membranes and can rearrange  leading to the formation of membrane  domains  with highly differentiated molecular compositions and supramolecular architectures  which are stabilized by lateral interactions among the membrane components . 
 although glycosphingolipids ( gsls ) were originally thought to be structural components of plasma membranes  several experiments suggested that gsls are involved in the regulation of numerous cellular functions . 
 the membrane lipid bilayer is a stable structure  constituting a physical boundary between intra- and extracellular environments . 
 gsls are expressed on the surface of cellular membranes . based on their physicochemical properties  especially their many hydroxyl and acetamide groups  which can act as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors  gsls form clusters through cis interactions . 
 there is a general consensus on the roles played by the ceramide moiety of gsls in promoting the formation and stabilization of membrane lipid domains . 
 in addition  ceramide was also shown to be involved in gsl - mediated functions and several biological activities [ 3  4 ] . 
 we recently showed that very long fatty acid chains of ceramide  such as c24:0 and c24:1  are responsible for the direct connection between lactosylceramide ( laccer  cdw17 ) and palmitoylated signal transducer molecules . 
 moreover  the phosphorylated product of sphingosine  sphingosine-1-phosphate ( s1p )  was shown to be important in immunological  especially inflammatory reactions [ 4  6 ] . 
 this review describes the role of the fatty acid chains of ceramide in gsl - mediated outside - in signaling in promoting gsl - enriched domain - mediated cellular functions  as well as the activities of s1p in inflammatory reactions of keratinocytes in human . 
 the most studied gsl - enriched domains are membrane lipid microdomains  called lipid rafts  defined by their gsl- and cholesterol - rich nature  enrichment in gpi - anchored proteins and membrane - anchored signaling molecules  and cytoskeletal association [ 7  8 ] . 
 as shown in artificial membrane models  gsls tend to form clusters  with this cluster formation confirmed in intact cells by immunoelectron microscopy [ 1012 ] . 
 the gsl - enriched microdomains on plasma membranes have a diameter of 50100  nm and include signal transducer molecules  such as src family kinases [ 11  12 ] . 
 gsls that contain saturated fatty acid chains with higher transition temperatures   show ordered  less fluid  liquid phase . 
 cholesterol is composed of a highly hydrophobic sterol - ring system and 3-hydroxy moiety  the only hydrophilic part of the molecule . the small cholesterol sterol - ring system and the ceramide moiety of sphingolipids are thought to interact via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic van der waal 's interactions . 
 in addition  hydrophilic interactions between sugar moieties of gsls promote the lateral association of gsls and cholesterol . 
 phospholipids tend to be loosely packaged in bilayers  resulting in the formation of liquid - disordered membranes that allow rapid lateral and rotational movement of lipids . 
 these interactions result in the separation of gsl- and cholesterol - enriched lipid microdomains from other phospholipids in the cell membrane and the formation of distinct domains . 
 electron microscopy using labeled anti - gsl antibodies has revealed gsl clusters on the surface of glycosphingolipid / phosphatidylcholine ( pc ) liposomes  even in the absence of sphingomyelin ( sm ) and cholesterol . 
 the anti - laccer mabs t5a7 and huly - m13 recognized laccer on human neutrophils  but only t5a7 recognized laccer on mouse neutrophils . 
 interestingly  huly - m13 but not t5a7 can be used for immunoprecipitation  suggesting a difference in binding and/or cluster formation of huly - m13 and t5a7 to laccer - enriched microdomains . 
 indeed  stimulated emission depletion ( sted ) superresolution microscopy showed that t5a7 and huly - m13 bind to different regions of the same laccer / dioleoylphosphatidylcholine ( dopc ) liposomes ( figure 1 ) . 
 laccer - enriched microdomains are composed of laccer  sm  phospholipids  and cholesterol . 
 surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that reduction of the laccer content in the dopc / cholesterol / laccer / sm lipid layer markedly decreased huly - m13 but not t5a7 binding to laccer  suggesting that the content of laccer in laccer - enriched microdomains affects the binding avidity of huly - m13 to laccer . 
 in contrast  the molecular species of pc  including dopc  dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ( dppc )  and palmitoyl - oleoyl - phosphatidylcholine ( popc )  did not affect the binding avidity of huly - m13 to laccer - coated plastic wells . 
 lactose inhibited the binding of huly - m13 to laccer / dopc liposome - coated and dopc / laccer mixture - coated plastic wells  suggesting that huly - m13 binds only to laccer clusters in laccer - enriched microdomains . 
 in contrast  the binding avidity of t5a7 to laccer - coated plastic wells was much weaker than its binding avidity to dopc / laccer-  popc / laccer-  and dppc / laccer mixture - coated wells  suggesting that the binding of t5a7 to laccer is affected by pc . the ability of lactose to inhibit the binding of t5a7 to dopc / laccer liposome - coated plastic wells was similar to its ability to inhibit the binding of huly - m13 . 
 in contrast  lactose inhibition of t5a7 binding to dopc / laccer mixture - coated plastic wells was significantly lower than its inhibition of huly - m13 binding  suggesting that t5a7 recognizes the pc - enhanced three - dimensional structure of laccer clusters . 
 thus  huly - m13 may bind to the core region of lactose clusters in laccer - enriched domains  while t5a7 binds to  dispersed  laccer clusters in the phase boundary regions of these microdomains . 
 these findings suggest that the specificities of these antibodies against the same gsls are dependent on the organizations of the gsls and molecules surrounding the gsl - enriched domains . 
 disorders of the degradation of gsls sometimes cause human diseases [ 18  19 ] . for degradation  
  those molecules are constitutively degraded by their suitable catabolic enzymes . when the activities of lysosomal enzymes are impaired  degradation is not able to proceed normally and undegraded molecules accumulate in the organelle and intracellular membranes  causing several metabolism diseases . 
 for instance  genetic disorder of glucocerebrosidase ( gba ) ( ec 3.2.1.45 ; )  gaucher disease  results in accumulation of glccer and its deacetylated form glucosylsphingosine is caused by abnormality of gba . 
 gaucher disease is a multisystem disorder whose features include peripheral blood cytopenias  hepatosplenomegaly  bone disease  and neurological manifestations in some cases . 
 the form of intravenous enzyme replacement therapy in the 1990s has been developed and resulted in dramatic improvements in haematological and visceral disease . 
 recognition of complications  including multiple myeloma and parkinson disease  has challenged the traditional macrophage - centric view of the pathophysiology of this disorder . 
 however  the pathways by which enzyme deficiency results in the clinical manifestations of this disorder remain obscure . in spinal cords of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) patients  levels of gm1  gm3  laccer  glccer  galcer  and ceramide were significantly elevated . 
 furthermore  glucocerebrosidase-1  glucocerebrosidase-2  hexosaminidase  galactosylceramidase  -galactosidase  and -galactosidase activities were also elevated in those patients . 
 inhibition of glucosylceramide synthesis accelerated disease course in als model mice  whereas infusion of exogenous gm3 significantly slowed the onset of paralysis and increased survival . 
 these observations suggest that gsls and their metabolism are likely important participants in pathogenesis of als . 
 further studies about gsl metabolism pathways in gsl - related disease will serve to advance our understanding of other associated disorders . 
 over the last 30 years  many studies have indicated that gsls expressed on the cell surface may act as binding sites for microorganisms . 
 the binding avidities of microorganisms to several types of gsl [ 2427 ] suggest that gsls are involved in host - pathogen interactions . 
 indeed  microorganisms have been shown to recognize and enter host cells via gsl - enriched membrane microdomains on the cells . among gsls 
  laccer has been well described to bind to several kinds of microorganisms  including viruses and fungi . 
 for instance  candida albicans specifically bind to laccer though the binding of -16-long glucosyl side - chain - branched -13-glucan to laccer - enriched domains [ 26  29 ] . 
 it is also well known that microorganisms - derived toxins  such as shiga toxin  specifically bind to gsls [ 3032 ] . 
 furthermore  a sphingolipid metabolite  ceramide  has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in pulmonary infection and inflammation .ceramide  which is degraded product of gsls and sphingomyelin  has been reported to form ceramide - rich membrane platforms and involve uptake of several microorganisms including pseudomonas aeruginosa . 
 abnormal amounts of enzymes involved in the synthesis of ceramide have been demonstrated in emphysematic smokers and in patients with severe sepsis . 
 gsls have been reported to interact with membrane proteins and modulate the properties of these proteins [ 2  25 ] . 
 in addition  certain proteins  including glycosylphosphatidylinositol- ( gpi- ) anchored and palmitoylated proteins  tend to enter gsl - enriched membrane microdomains . 
 however  the mechanism by which gsls interact with proteins and mediate outside - in signaling is unclear . 
 the ceramide moiety consists of a long chain base linked to a fatty acid chain . 
 sphingosine containing c18 carbons [ ( 2s3r4e)-2-amino-13-dihydroxy - octadecene ] is generally the main structure in mammals  but a structure containing 20 carbons is relatively abundant in neurons . 
 ceramide is synthesized by ceramide synthases ( cers ) 16  each of which uses a restricted subset of fatty acyl - coas for n - acylation of the sphingoid long chain base . 
 the expression levels of genes encoding cers are tissue specific  suggesting that the molecular varieties and expression patterns of gsls are associated with the functions of these cells . 
 although gsl - enriched microdomains have been implicated in a number of important membrane events [ 2  38  39 ]  the molecular mechanisms responsible for gsl - mediated cell functions are still unclear . 
 one of the main issues centers around the association of gsls with signal transducer molecules localized on the cytosolic side . 
 laccer  along with the src family kinase lyn  forms lipid microdomains on the plasma membranes of human neutrophils and is involved in several cellular functions  including chemotaxis  phagocytosis  and superoxide generation  highly dependent on lyn [ 16  29  38 ] . 
 hl-60 cells differentiated into neutrophilic lineage cells by dmso ( d - hl-60 ) were found to acquire superoxide generating activity  but not through laccer  despite their expression of laccer on plasma membranes . 
 most laccer and lyn were recovered in the microdomain fractions of neutrophils and d - hl-60 cells . 
 lipidomics analysis revealed that laccer in the neutrophil plasma membrane was mainly composed of molecular species containing c16:0  c24:1  and c24:0 fatty acid chains  whereas over 70% of laccer in the plasma membranes of d - hl-60 cells contained c16:0 fatty acid chains  but only about 14% were c24:1 and c24:0 . 
 lyn was immunoprecipitated by anti - laccer antibody in neutrophils but not d - hl-60 cells . 
 importantly  lyn was coimmunoprecipitated by anti - laccer antibody from the detergent resistant membrane ( drm ) fraction of plasma membranes from c24:0 and c24:1  but not c16:0 or c22:0  laccer - loaded d - hl-60 cells . 
 anti - laccer antibody induced superoxide generation from d - hl-60 cells loaded with c24:0-laccer  but not c16:0-laccer . 
 lyn colocalized with laccer - enriched domains of d - hl-60 cells loaded with c24:0-laccer  but not c16:0-laccer . 
 these results suggested that the c24 fatty acid chain of laccer is indispensable for connecting lyn with laccer - enriched microdomains . 
 knockdown of lyn molecules by human lyn - specific short interfering rna ( sirna ) in d - hl-60 cells completely abolished the effects of c24:1-laccer loading function  suggesting that lyn is crucial for c24-laccer - mediated neutrophil function . 
 experiments using azide - photoactivatable tritium - labeled c24- and c16-laccer revealed that c24- but not c16-laccer directly associated with lyn and a heterotrimeric g protein subunit gi . 
 these results confirm a specific direct interaction between c24-laccer and the signal transduction molecules lyn and gi  which are associated with the cytoplasmic layer via palmitic acid chains ( figure 2 ) . 
 laccer species with very long fatty acids are indispensable for lyn - coupled laccer - enriched membrane microdomain - mediated neutrophil functions . 
 gpi - anchored proteins are composed of glycerol phospholipids  which do not have c24 fatty acid chains  suggesting that gpi - anchored proteins are not able to form large clusters by themselves and can not directly connect with signal transduction molecules through fatty acid chains . to mediate cell functions  gpi - anchored proteins require signal transduction molecule - coupled transmembrane proteins or gsl - enriched domains  such as laccer - enriched domains . 
 the epidermis consists of a single layer of proliferating undifferentiated keratinocytes  the stratum basale  and several superficial layers of the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum ( sg )  which form the stratum corneum ( sc ) . 
 the sc acts as an air - liquid interface barrier to avoid drying of tissues in contact with air . 
 ceramide is the main component of sc and is important for the water retention and permeability barrier functions of sc . 
 sphingosine can be phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase to form s1p  a molecule involved in a wide range of cellular functions  including growth  differentiation  survival  chemotaxis  angiogenesis  and embryogenesis  in various types of cells [ 44  45 ] . 
 s1p was shown to inhibit keratinocyte proliferation  to promote corneocyte differentiation  and to chemoattract keratinocytes . 
 roles of s1p in skin immunological functions have been demonstrated in mouse models [ 45  4751 ] . 
 mice are the good experimental tool of choice for the majority of immunologists  and the study of immune responses in mice has provided considerable insight into human immune system function . however  there are significant differences in immunological reactions between mice and human 
 . little is known  however  about the role of ceramide metabolites in the immunological functions of differentiating keratinocytes . 
 a neutral cdase from pseudomonas aeruginosa an17 ( pacdase ) isolated from a patient with atopic dermatitis ( ad ) was shown to require detergents to hydrolyze ceramide . 
 staphylococcus aureus - derived lipids  which consist primarily of cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol  enhanced the pacdase hydrolysis of normal ceramide and of human skin - specific omega - hydroxyacyl ceramide in the absence of detergents . 
 a three - dimensionally cultured human primary keratinocyte ( 3d keratinocyte ) culture system has been utilized to simulate epidermal differentiation at its air - liquid interface  resulting in the generation of basal  spinous  and granular layers and an sc  with the latter displaying permeability barrier functions . 
 treatment of 3d keratinocytes with pacdase and water - soluble stimulants of keratinocytes  including trypsin  dermatophagoides pteronyssinus class 1 allergen ( der p1 )  and dermatophagoides farinae allergen ( der f1 ) had no effect on the expression of any of the genes in our dna microarray analysis  indicating that the sc of the 3d keratinocyte culture acts as a permeability barrier . 
 triton x-100 is a detergent that reduces permeability barrier functions  thereby moderately increasing transepidermal water loss and the production of erythema on human skin . in the presence of 0.1% triton x-100  pacdase 
 markedly enhanced tnf- mrna expression in 3d keratinocytes  an increase not observed in cells treated with triton x-100 alone . 
 tnf- mrna expression was not enhanced by heat - inactivated or mutant pacdase  suggesting that ceramide metabolites induce tnf- mrna expression in keratinocytes . 
 tnf-  a critical cytokine in several dermatological diseases  is secreted by keratinocytes   and shown to be involved in the progression of atopic dermatitis ( ad ) . among the metabolites of ceramide  
 s1p is synthesized from sphingosine by sphingosine kinase ( sphk ) and stimulates 3d keratinocytes through specific receptors . 
 both the specific sphk inhibitor cas 1177741 - 83 - 1 and the s1p receptor antagonist vpc 23019 suppressed the pacdase - induced expression of tnf- mrna in 3d keratinocytes . 
 s1p is generally considered to stimulate cells through plasma membrane g protein - coupled receptors  for example  s1p1s1p5 . 
 however  vpc2301  a competitive antagonist for s1p1 and s1p3 receptors  inhibited the pacdase - enhanced gene expression not only of tnf- but also of endothelin-1 and il-8 . 
 thus  the s1p - induced production of these inflammatory mediators is mediated by s1p receptors in human primary keratinocytes in a 3d culture system . 
 cdna microarray analysis showed that s1p strongly upregulated the expression of endothelin-1  cxcl1  tnf-  
 -defensin 5  il-8  cxcl2  interferon regulatory factor 1  gadd45 gamma  and il-23 subunit mrnas . 
 il-8  cxcl1  and cxcl2 have been reported to be upregulated in the lesional skin of patients with ad and psoriasis . 
 s1p also enhanced the expression of claudin-4 mrna  which has been observed in more layers of psoriatic than normal epidermis . 
 tnf- can induce the production of endothelin-1 and il-8 by human keratinocytes [ 66  67 ] . 
 infliximab  a chimeric igg1 monoclonal antibody against human tnf-  inhibits the tnf--mediated production of il-8 by keratinocytes . 
 the nf-b inhibitor curcumin inhibited pacdase - induced expression of il-8 and endothelin-1 mrnas but not of tnf- mrna . 
 therefore  it is likely that s1p induces tnf- production and release from 3d keratinocytes via s1p receptors  resulting in tnf- induction of cytokine production through nf-b - mediated signal transduction ( figure 3 ) . 
 tnf- is a critical cytokine in psoriatic immunopathology  and the development of an effective strategy is required to counteract its effects . 
 infliximab  which is used to treat patients with plaque psoriasis  psoriatic arthritis  pustular psoriasis ( excluding localized type )  and psoriatic erythroderma [ 71  72 ]  downregulates antiapoptotic proteins in regressing psoriatic skin . 
 the effects of infliximab have also been evaluated in other inflammatory dermatoses and in systemic diseases involving the skin  pityriasis rubra pilaris  pyoderma gangrenosum  and cutaneous sarcoidosis . 
 ad is characterized by a marked reduction in ceramides in the sc of lesional and nonlesional forearms [ 74  75 ] and by increased activities of the enzymes ceramidase ( cdase ) . 
 the metabolic conversion of ceramide to s1p has been found to protect keratinocytes against uvb - induced  ceramide - mediated apoptosis . 
 histamine h1-receptor blockers are used to treat all types of itch resulting from serious skin diseases  such as ad  as well as from renal and liver diseases . 
 however  they often lack efficacy in chronic itch  a profound clinical problem that decreases quality of life . nerve density in the epidermis is partly involved in itch sensitization in pruritic skin diseases  such as ad . endothelin-1 has been shown to elicit itch in humans [ 8082 ] . 
 the molecular pathways that contribute to the transduction of itch responses to endothelin-1 do not require either plc3 or trpv1 of neurons  which mediate histamine- and serotonin - induced itch responses  respectively . 
 several reports have described the roles of ceramide metabolites in immunological and inflammatory diseases [ 8488 ] . however  the physiological roles of gsl - enriched microdomains are largely undetermined  although much is known about the organization and functions of laccer - enriched microdomains [ 24  89  90 ] 
 . the analogous patterns of gsls and motifs of pamps result in the generation of autoantibodies against these gsls  inducing severe autoimmune inflammatory diseases . 
 antibodies against neuronal tissues are involved in immune - mediated neurological disorders  with expression of several of these antibodies found to correlate with the pathophysiology of these diseases [ 92  93 ] . 
 therefore  elucidation of their organization and structural specificities  based on interactions between gsls and surrounding molecules  are important for understanding the physiological functions of gls - enriched microdomains and their related diseases .","


Abstract: 
Glycosphingolipids (GSLs), composed of ceramide and sugar chains, form membrane microdomains with transducer molecules. However, the exact functions of GSLs remain unclear. This review explores the role of ceramide and its metabolites in immunological and inflammatory reactions in humans.

Research and Discussion: 
Lactosylceramide (LacCer) is highly expressed on human phagocyte membranes and mediates various immune reactions. LacCer forms microdomains with src kinase and G proteins, connected through very long fatty acids. Ceramidase hydrolysis of ceramide produces sphingosine, which is then phosphorylated to sphingosine-1-phosphate and plays a role in cellular functions.

Results and Conclusion: 
The role of ceramide in GSL-mediated signaling is strongly influenced by its very long fatty acid chain. Metabolites of ceramide, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate, are involved in numerous cellular functions. In the context of immunology and inflammation, the findings suggest potentially important roles for ceramide and its metabolites in mediating outside-in signaling."
"stimulated by the promise of mechanically interlocked molecular architectures with potential employment in future nanotechnological applications such as in the development of molecular machines and switches  the interest being shown in their construction is ever increasing . 
 rotaxane and catenane species can also  however  be designed to function as selective host systems whereby the topologically unique interlocked three - dimensional cavities are exploited to selectively recognise specific guest species . in previous work  we have utilised anion templation to construct a range of rotaxanes and catenanes  which  upon removal of the template  bind anions strongly and selectively in competitive solvent mixtures . 
 furthermore  selective anion binding can be exploited to bring about triggered motion within the interlocked supramolecular architectures  underlining the possible application of these systems in the preparation of molecular switches . to sense and monitor anion binding ( and/or binding - triggered motion )  it is desirable to integrate a redox- or photoactive reporter group in proximity to the interlocked anion - binding site . 
 examples of interlocked hosts with the capability of sensing anions by electrochemical or optical[3b  4  6 ] methods are rare . 
 herein  we report the preparation of the first anion - templated rotaxane incorporating an optically- and electro - active osmium(ii ) tris(bipyridine ) reporter group . after removal of the anion template 
  selective anion binding is investigated by monitoring the optical and electronic output from the osmium(ii ) tris(bipyridine ) reporter moiety . to develop and fabricate a prototype molecular sensory system  
 surface association removes complications associated with brownian motion  typically increases conformational rigidity  and will underpin potential applications of such molecular architectures and  ultimately  device integration.[1b ] to date  only a limited number of surface - bound interlocked structures have been reported.[5b  c  7 ] hence  we additionally report the anion - templated assembly of these electrochemically active osmium(ii ) bipyridyl rotaxane structures on gold substrates and  after template removal  the specific reporting of anion recruitment from solution ( figure 1 ) . 
 schematic representation of the recognition and sensing of anions for a surface - bound rotaxane . 
 axle in blue  macrocycle in green  with anion binding functionalities shown in red . 
 design of the system : the target design for the mechanically bonded host features the incorporation of the osmium(ii ) tris(bipyridine ) reporter group into the macrocyclic component of a rotaxane molecular framework containing a convergent hydrogen - bond - donor anion - binding interlocked cavity . 
 the macrocycle contains the 44-bis(amide)-22-bipyridyl motif for coordination to the osmium(ii ) metal centre and electron - rich hydroquinone units to facilitate supplementary secondary aromatic donor  acceptor interactions with the electron - deficient positively charged pyridinium axle.[3a ] the choice of the osmium(ii ) bipyridyl reporter group comes from its established electro- and photochemical properties  making the system an attractive probe to sense the anion - binding event . 
 synthesis of the rotaxanes : three distinct osmium(ii ) bipyridyl ( bipy ) rotaxanes  13  were prepared by clipping and stoppering anion - templated synthetic methodologies  comprising the same macrocycle component and different axle lengths ( scheme 1 ) . 
 rotaxane 1 was obtained in two steps by a chloride - anion - templated  clipping  reaction between axle[3a ] components bis(amine ) 8 and 44-bis(chlorocarbonyl)-22-bipyridine 9 in the presence of et3n in dry dichloromethane ( scheme 2 and scheme s1 in the supporting information ) . 
 the crude metal - free rotaxane intermediate was then treated with [ os(bipy)2cl2 ]  16  in an etoh / h2o mixture at reflux to give  after anion exchange using 0.1 m aqueous nh4pf6  rotaxane 1 in 6 % overall yield . 
 macrocycle 19 was synthesised in 37 % yield by condensation of the bis(amine ) 8 with bis(acid chloride ) 9 in the presence of et3n and template 17 in dry dichloromethane . 
 reaction of macrocycle 19 with 16 in an etoh / h2o mixture at reflux afforded  after anion exchange  macrocycle 4 in 74 % yield . 
 the reaction of carboxy  terphenyl amide pyridine derivative 10[3f ] with oxalyl chloride produced the corresponding acid chloride  which upon condensation with 3-bromopropylamine hydrobromide in the presence of et3n in dry dichloromethane gave bis(amide ) 11 . 
 this was converted to its azide derivative 12 by reaction with sodium azide in dimethylformamide . 
 reaction of compound 12 with methyl iodide at reflux  followed by anion exchange using 0.1 m aqueous nh4pf6  gave the desired axle precursor 13 . 
 an analogous condensation reaction between the acyl chloride derivative of 10 and 4-(azidomethyl)biphenyl-4-yl - methanamine  followed by methylation and anion exchange  produced axle precursor 14 ( scheme 2 ) . 
 rotaxanes 2 and 3 were obtained in 16 and 72 % yield  respectively  by  mono stoppering 
 reactions followed by washing with nh4pf6/h2o to remove the chloride template ( see the supporting information  scheme s1 ) . 
 axle precursors 13 and 14 were added to macrocycle 4 leading to chloride - anion - templated pseudo - rotaxane assembly . 
 alkyne cycloaddition ( cuaac ) reactions in dry dichloromethane using alkyne stopper 15  copper(i ) tetrakis(acetonitrile ) hexafluorophosphate  tris(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine ( tbta ) and diisopropylethylamine afforded the desired rotaxanes 2 and 3 . 
 rotaxanes 13 were characterised by nmr spectroscopy ( h  c  f and p ) and by mass spectrometry ( maldi - tof ) . 
 h nmr spectra of rotaxanes 13 ( figure 2 ) reveal splitting and an upfield shift of hydroquinone protons of the macrocycle component  owing to aromatic donor  acceptor interactions between the electron - rich hydroquinone groups and the electron - deficient pyridinium moiety of the axle  characteristic of an interlocked structure . 
 h nmr spectra ( 500 mhz  [ d6]acetone / d2o ( 7:3 )  293 k ) of rotaxanes 1 ( a )  2 ( c )  3 ( e ) and their chloride complexes 1 cl ( b )  2 cl ( d )  and 3 cl ( f ) after addition of one equivalent of chloride . 
 anion - binding studies in solution : anion binding was probed by using nmr  luminescence and electrochemical methods in assorted solvents as dictated by various factors . 
 these techniques all have dramatically different limits of detection and different requirements from the system . in the case of nmr titration  
 initial assessments in acetonitrile revealed strong association with anions  compounded by the low solubility of the generated complexes  a fact that necessitated the use of a more competitive aqueous solvent mixture  [ d6]acetone / d2o ( 7:3 ) . 
 luminescence spectroscopy  offering much lower detection limits  presents a quantum yield weighted average ; as a consequence  the response of the observed luminescence to anion concentrations varies between solvents . 
 this is particularly true in the case of osmium tris(bipy ) complexes  in which solvation of the excited state plays an important role in determining the form of the spectrum . small quantities of water were added to the acetonitrile mixtures ; it was found that the addition of 3 % water produced optimal and reproducible changes to the osmium emission spectrum . in the case of electrochemistry  the need for a large potential window to resolve bipy - ligand - based voltammetry and the use of relatively concentrated electrolytes dictated the use of acetonitrile as a solvent system . 
 h nmr investigations : preliminary h nmr anion titration experiments between rotaxanes 1  2 and 3 and various anions ( cl  aco and h2po4 ) were performed in competitive [ 
 the addition of one equivalent of tetrabutylammonium ( tba ) chloride resulted in a downfield shift of inner protons  ( 0.13  0.05 and 0.29 ppm ) and c ( 0.10  0.05 and 0.34 ppm ) for rotaxanes 1  2 and 3  respectively  indicative of halide binding within the rotaxane s interlocked binding cavity ( figure 2 ) . 
 in addition  modest upfield perturbations of the macrocyclic hydroquinone protons of the respective rotaxane were observed  g ( 0.02  0.02 and 0.06 ppm ) and h ( 0.03  0.02 and 0.03 ppm ) for 1  2 and 3  respectively . when oxoanions such as acetate or dihydrogen phosphate where added  only a small perturbation was observed for inner protons . in the case of rotaxane 3  the  protons move upfield  an indication of the oxoanion binding on the periphery of the rotaxane . 
 wineqnmr2 analysis of the binding isotherms with chloride and acetate anions  obtained by monitoring the chemical - shift perturbation of proton  of the axle component of the respective rotaxane versus equivalent of anion ( figure 3 )  determined 1:1 stoichiometric association constants ( table 1 ) . 
 it proved impossible to obtain quantitative binding data from any of the dihydrogen phosphate titration experiments  indicative of a complex equilibrium binding process ( chemical shifts observed were too small  association constants < 100 m  to be sensibly fitted within error ) . 
 a ) chemical - shift perturbation of proton  upon addition of cl (  )  aco (  ) and h2po4 (  ) ( as the tba salt ) to a solution of   rotaxane 1 ( unfilled )  2 ( half - filled ) and 3 ( filled ) in 7:3 [ d6]acetone / d2o at 293 k. b ) chemical - shift perturbation of proton c upon addition of cl ( as the tba salt ) to a solution of macrocycle 4 in 7:3 [ d6]acetone / d2o (  ) and in 9:1 [ d6]acetone / d2o (  ) at 293 k. symbols represent experimental data ; continuous lines represent calculated curves . 
 association constants [ m ] of rotaxanes 1  2 and 3 in 7:3 acetone / d2o and macrocycle 4 in 9:1 acetone / d2o with cl and aco ( as tba salts ) at 293 k [ a ] obtained by monitoring proton . error < 15 % ( for all values ) . 
 [ b ] determined by monitoring proton c. error < 10 % . [ c ] in 9:1 acetone / d2o . 
 the results indicate selectivity towards cl  with only weak and peripheral association with aco and h2po4 . 
 the oxoanions are too large to penetrate the interlocked binding domain  whereas chloride anions are of complementary size and shape leading to strong binding even in this competitive 30 % aqueous solvent mixture . comparing the strength of chloride anion binding for the three rotaxanes  the interlocked host 3  containing a rigid biphenyl axle linkage  exhibits significantly stronger binding . 
 this may reflect the optimal degree of preorganisation of the interlocked binding domain of the respective rotaxane as determined by the nature of the axle component . 
 the relatively more preorganised binding sites of rotaxanes 1 and 3  as compared with the flexible propyl - linked axle component present in 2  potentially enhances chloride binding . 
 steric congestion could be responsible for 1 being a relatively inferior halide - complexing reagent in comparison with 3 . 
 the binding of chloride anions by macrocycle 4 was also investigated ( table 1 and figure 3 b ) . 
 as expected  the binding is very weak in 7:3 acetone / water  as shown by the small downfield shift of protons c  0.03 ppm after addition of one equivalent of chloride . 
 the h nmr titration experiment was repeated in 9:1 acetone / water  a less competitive solvent mixture  which enabled a 1:1 stoichiometric association constant of 210 m to be determined . 
 analogous titrations with acetate anions revealed only small perturbations of the macrocycle proton  indicative of weak binding . 
 these observations serve to highlight the rotaxanes potency for chloride anion recognition as a consequence of their three - dimensional binding cavities being capable of encapsulation of this guest . 
 macrocycle 4 and the rotaxanes ( 13 ) all display two emission bands in the near - ir region centred at approximately 800 and 925 nm ( figure 4 ) following excitation into metal - to - ligand charge transfer ( mlct ) absorption bands at 430 nm  with the lifetimes of the two bands determined to be 44 and 35 ns at 800 and 950 nm  respectively . 
 a ) titration of rotaxane 1 with tbacl in 97:3 acetonitrile / water  showing emission spectra uncorrected for detector sensitivity ; (  ) increasing chloride anion concentration . 
 b ) binding isotherms and fits from the same titration following the two emission bands . 
 these observations are consistent with those of nozaki and co - workers  who assigned the presence of two bands in the emission spectra of osmium bipyridyl complexes to subtle variations in the osmium environment arising from solvation - induced polarisation of the triplet state . upon titration with tbacl in 97:3 acetonitrile / water  
 an increase in emission intensity was observed for all four species  with the increases being more pronounced for the higher - energy bands . 
 given the conclusions of nozaki regarding solvent - induced distortions to the triplet - state structure  it is plausible that anion binding will also influence local structure to differing degrees . 
 representative spectra are shown in figure 4 along with the corresponding binding isotherms and fits . 
 association constants were obtained with the dynafit software using a 1:1 binding model ( table 2 ) . 
 association constants [ m ] determined by luminescence titration of macrocycle 4 and rotaxanes 1  2 and 3 in 97:3 acetonitrile / water  with chloride  dihydrogen phosphate and acetate anions  as tba salts [ a ] 99 % confidence intervals given in square brackets . a 1:1 binding model 
 acetate and dihydrogen phosphate ( as their tba salts ) were also titrated with rotaxane 1 and the macrocycle 4 for comparison  although with the latter  phosphate anion binding could not be determined owing to precipitation . 
 the data indicate that the binding of chloride anions with the rotaxanes is two orders of magnitude greater than that with the macrocycle . 
 the chloride anion association constants obtained from luminescence measurements for the three rotaxanes confirm the observations from nmr spectroscopy of strong binding of chloride ions by rotaxane 3 . 
 it should be noted that the change in solvent system will also be reflected in differences in binding owing to different solvation of the host . in this relatively uncompetitive solvent system  it is likely that many anions will associate with the cationic receptors ; indeed  studies on dihydrogen phosphate and acetate bear out this hypothesis . 
 it is important to point out that it is likely such optical titrations are notably less reflective of binding selectivity in that they report anion association  be it cavity confined or peripheral . 
 cyclic voltammetric scans ( figure 5 ) of an acetonitrile solution containing macrocycle 4 revealed an electrochemical redox system at 0.605 v vs. ag / ag  assigned to the reversible os(+2/+3 ) redox couple . 
 in addition  the three bipyridyl - ligand - centred redox systems were observed at 1.375  1.715 and 1.975 v vs. ag / ag ( labelled x  y  z  respectively ) consistent with previous reports of a tris(bipy ) ruthenium moiety . 
 these assignments were confirmed by equivalent integration of the charges associated with the os(+2/+3 ) redox system and the bipyridyl - ligand - centred redox events  as expected as all are one - electron redox systems on the same species . in accordance with our previous report  the least - cathodic bipy redox couple ( x  figure 5 ) 
 is assigned to the amide - substituted bipyridyl  located next to the anion - binding site ( in light of the electron - withdrawing nature of the carbonyl amide moieties ) . 
 cyclic voltammetric scans of 0.2 mm of macrocycle 4 in 0.15 m tbapf6/ch3cn ; scan rate=0.1 vs. insert : electrochemical titrations of 4 with tbacl monitoring bipy couples x  y and z. titrations of macrocycle 4 with tbacl or tbaoac were carried out to determine the ability of ligand- and metal - centre - based redox potentials to report on anion association . as shown in figure 6 a  cathodic perturbations of approximately 20 mv and 40 mv of the metal - centred osmium - based ( + 2/+3 ) couple are observed upon the addition of 5 molar equivalents of tbacl and tbaoac  respectively . 
 the bipy - ligand - centred responses scale in accordance with their vicinity to the anion - association site  with x showing the strongest perturbations and z the weakest  in the presence of 5-fold excess of cl and aco ( see insert figure 5  schemes s2 and s3 in the supporting information ) . 
 these observations are fully consistent with both anionic species being bound in the vicinity of the bis(amide ) bipy cavity . 
 dynafit modelling analysis of a simultaneous fit of both the metal - centred os(+2/+3 ) couple and the least - cathodic ligand - centred ( x ) potential perturbations as a function of anion concentration gave 1:1 stoichiometric association constants of 2.510 [ 2.22.710 ] and 1.510 [ 1.12.110 ] m  for chloride and acetate anions  respectively . 
 the larger association constant ( and potential shifts ) observed after addition of tbaoac  compared with tbacl  can be attributed to the stronger association of aco to the amide - based binding site than cl  owing to the relative basicities of the anions . 
 e1/2 of a ) os(+2/+3 ) and b ) bipy couple versus equivalents of tbacl (  ) and tbaaco (  ) added . 
 we assign the higher luminescence and electrochemically defined association constants  in comparison to those obtained by nmr spectroscopy  to the more competitive aqueous solvent system used for the latter  but we acknowledge also that optical and redox transitions may not be exactly equivalent in their response to specific anion association . indeed  optical transition energies are likely to be sensitive to broad electrostatic / dielectric change in the vicinity of relevant chromophore orbitals ; redox signatures are more specifically sensitive to electron density at the bipyridyl and osmium centres and  hence  may be more reflective of specific anion association . 
 resolved fundamental electrochemical characteristics of the rotaxane hosts are similar to those of the macrocycle and are reported in the supporting information ( page 4 ) . 
 unfortunately  a combination of sluggish diffusion and strong physical - adsorption - based electrode fouling precluded the attainment of reliable electrochemical anion - binding data with the rotaxanes . 
 surface immobilisation of the rotaxane : the cui - catalysed huisgen cycloaddition of axles 13 and 14 to prepared alkyne - terminated molecular films on gold ( see the experimental section ) in the presence of templating chloride anions and a 5-fold excess of macrocycle 4  generates surface - confined rotaxane assemblies ( scheme 3 ) . 
 accompanying ellipsometry - defined increases in film thickness ( ( 1.30.1 ) nm ) are consistent with axle - to - surface orientations being normal or close to normal . 
 control surface analyses  in the absence of cui catalyst  confirm this surface assembly to be specifically click - chemistry driven . 
 the associated template locking of the osmium bipy macrocycle at the surface by this process is confirmed by resolved osmium - based ( + 2/+3 ) electrochemical signatures ( figure 7 ) . 
 an integration of these signals resolves surface macrocycle concentrations of 1.05 and 2.510 mol cm for axles 13 and 14  respectively  corresponding to 20 and 45 % of a densely packed monolayer  based on a macrocycle footprint of 3.0 nm . 
 surface association is both stable to ultrasonic washing and only observed with the chloride anion template specifically involved ( importantly  no macrocycle - osmium - based ( + 2/+3 ) electrochemical response is observed if the pf6 salts of 13 or 14 are used ) . 
 the linear scaling of os(+2/+3 ) redox peak current with voltage scan rate is further confirmatory of surface entrapment . 
 the surface - density differences between axle - only and rotaxane films are  additionally  resolvable through both electrode access of a solution - phase faradaic redox probe and surface - capacitance analysis ; an axle - only film being significantly more densely packed ( 10 f cm ) than a rotaxane film with a  mushroom - shaped  component ( 25 and 15 f cm for surfaces prepared with 13 and 14  respectively ; scheme s4 in the supporting information ) . 
 estimated surface concentration as 50 % of theoretical maximum ( calculated from a molecular footprint of the macrocycle  3.0 nm ) . 
 distance of faradaic exchange estimated at approximately 2 nm based on localisation of the macrocycle at the pyridinium station and a perpendicular orientation of the axle to the underlying gold surface . 
 insert : potential shifts of surface - bound os(+2/+3 ) couple  after immersion of rotaxane interface in tbaaco / ch3cn and tbacl / ch3cn solutions following washing with nh4pf6/h2o to remove cl template . 
 it is notable that axle 14 generates a significantly higher ( > 200 % ) macrocycle capture on the surface than that observed with axle 13  consistent with both increased axle rigidity and a higher associated chloride anion template association constant ( table 1 ) . 
 these films constitute not only an addition to the few surface - confined tethered interlocked systems but  to the best of our knowledge  are also the first incorporating a redox - active osmium(ii ) bipy reporter motif . 
 we have also investigated the possibility that surface - presented vacant interlocked cavities ( generated by using axle 14 ) can provide a means of selectively recruiting and electrochemically sensing chloride anions . 
 the chloride anion template was initially removed by washing with copious amounts of 0.1 m nh4pf6/h2o . 
 pleasingly  subsequent halide anion recruitment is both detectable and selective  exhibiting no cathodic perturbation upon immersion in a 50 m solution of acetate anions ( the observed 2 mv shift is less than the 3 mv error of the reference electrode )  but a 14 mv cathodic shift upon immersion in a chloride - anion - containing solution of the same concentration(with both solutions being formed from the tba salt in anhydrous ch3cn  figure 7 ) . 
 no potential shift was observed when the cavity was not depopulated prior to immersion in the chloride solution  as expected for a cavity exhibiting 1:1 binding stoichiometry . 
 these results are consistent with those presented in table 1 and confirm the selectivity of the three - dimensional cavity towards chloride anion binding . 
 furthermore  the smaller potential shift observed here upon binding of chloride anions  in comparison with that observed of the macrocycle  is attributed to the electron - withdrawing nature of the positively charged pyridinium motif of the axle component  mitigating donation of electron density to the osmium centre  and is indicative of the interlocked surface - bound structure . 
 interlocked structures can be engineered to bind specific guests within the topologically constrained three - dimensional cavities created during their template - driven syntheses . 
 this binding ability  when coupled to the signal - transduction capabilities associated with appended reporter groups  make catenanes and rotaxanes highly promising candidates for the development of molecular sensors . 
 we have reported herein the solution and surface synthesis of a number of anion - templated rotaxanes incorporating the photo- and electroactive tris(bipy ) osmium moiety . upon removal of the chloride anion template  
 h nmr titration of the solution rotaxanes with a number of anions ( chosen on the basis of their contrasting size  shape and basicity ) showed selectivity for chloride anions over acetate anions and dihydrogen phosphate oxoanions  observations broadly supported by associated perturbations in osmium luminescence or redox character . 
 rotaxane immobilisation onto an alkyne - modified gold electrode substrate by copper(i)-catalysed huisgen cycloaddition produced molecular films capable of responding electrochemically and selectively to chloride anions . 
 this work clearly demonstrates the successful application of self - assembled monolayers to the electrochemical sensing of halide ions .

1) Abstract: In this study, we report the preparation of [2]rotaxanes containing an electrochemically and optically active osmium(ii) bipyridyl macrocycle mechanically bonded with cationic pyridinium axles. These interlocked host systems demonstrate the ability to recognize and sense anionic guest species, as shown by various spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques.

2) Research and Discussion: The synthesis of these rotaxanes involves the use of anion templation and copper(i)-catalyzed huisgen cycloaddition to assemble the molecular components. The resulting rotaxane films on gold electrodes exhibit selective and reversible electrochemical responses towards chloride ions. This highlights the potential applications of these rotaxanes as sensors for anionic species.

3) Results and Conclusion: The successful synthesis and characterization of these [2]rotaxanes demonstrate the capability of mechanically interlocked molecules to serve as stimuli-responsive materials. The surface assembly of these rotaxanes onto gold electrodes through anion templation opens up possibilities for further functionalization and applications in electrochemical sensing. These findings contribute to the growing field of supramolecular chemistry and its potential impact in various fields such as sensing, drug delivery, and molecular machines.

"fatty acids ( fas )  the components of phospholipids in organelle and cellular membranes  play important biological roles by maintaining or processing membrane protein function or fluidity.1 in addition  fas modulate vascular inflammation  a key mechanism of atherosclerosis  cerebral small vessel pathologies  and stroke  by altering intracellular signal transduction or controlling lipid mediators such as prostaglandins  thromboxanes  or leukotrienes.2 among fas  3-polyunsaturated fas ( 3-pufas )  such as eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( dha )  are potent anti - inflammatory molecules . 
 epa and dha decrease expression of receptors for chemoattractants on blood inflammatory cells and prohibit migration of neutrophils or monocytes . 
 therefore  3-pufas may protect from atherosclerotic changes.34 several clinical studies have emphasized the role of fas in the risk or occurrence of stroke5 or cardiovascular disease6 ; however  the effects due to the composition of fas on stroke or cardiovascular disease remain controversial . 
 high - dose 3-pufas has been reported to have beneficial effects on cardiac or sudden death.7 high levels of plasma 3-pufas can decrease the risk of myocardial infarction.8 in terms of stroke  low levels of circulating 3-pufas in the blood is a risk factor for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.9 a decreased proportion of linoleic acid is also associated with ischemic stroke.10 compared to normal controls  stroke patients with moderate - to - severe intracranial arterial stenosis or occlusion had decreased levels of dha.11 on the other hand  a recent meta - analysis revealed that the evidence for the beneficial effects of 3-pufas is insufficient in adults with peripheral arterial disease associated with poor cardiovascular outcome.12 to date  little information is available on the relationship between the composition of fas and prognosis of stroke . 
 therefore  we investigated whether the composition of fas was associated with stroke severity on hospital admission and functional outcomes at 3-months follow - up of patients with acute non - cardiogenic ischemic stroke . 
 between september 2007 and may 2010  we prospectively enrolled patients diagnosed with a first - episode of ischemic stroke and admitted to our hospital within 7 days after onset of symptoms . 
 the patient 's demographic information as well as past medical  medication and familial history ; brain imaging studies ( computerized tomography [ ct ] and/or magnetic resonance imaging [ mri ] ) ; vascular imaging studies ( digital subtraction angiography  ct angiography  or mr angiography ) ; chest radiography ; 12-lead electrocardiography ; electrocardiography monitoring during a median time period of 3 days at the intensive stroke care unit ; transthoracic echocardiography ; and routine blood test data were collected.13 patients were preferentially excluded if they did not agree to provide blood samples for our study  or if they were taking lipid - lowering agents such as statins  niacin  fenofibrate  or 3-pufas as components of health foods and supplements.11 of a total of 401 subjects were enrolled  however those  who on the basis of the trial of org 10172 in acute stroke treatment classification system14 had moderate or high risk cardiac sources of embolism ( n=127 ) were excluded . 
 patients who had undetermined stroke subtype ( n=45 : negative evaluation  n=19 : two or more causes identified ) or those who had rare causes of stroke subtype ( n=10 )  such as moyamoya disease  arterial dissection  or venous thrombosis were also excluded from this study . 
 moreover  patients who received incomplete vascular imaging work - up ( n=2 ) and those who had transient ischemic attacks with negative diffusion - weighted images ( n=42 ) were not enrolled . 
 for extracranial arteries  the degree of arterial stenosis was measured according to the published method used in the north american symptomatic carotid endarterectomy trial.15 for intracranial arteries  the degree of arterial stenosis was measured based on the methods used in the warfarin - aspirin symptomatic intracranial disease study.16 vascular images were evaluated by two independent vascular neurologists  who were blinded to the clinical information . 
 inter - observer agreement on the presence of more than 50% stenosis and/or occlusion was excellent ( kappa=0.95 ) . 
 the severity of neurologic deficits was determined using the national institutes of health stroke scale ( nihss ) on admission.17 a recurrent ischemic stroke was considered in the presence of acute onset of focal neurological signs of more than 24 hours duration with evidence of a new ischemic lesion on ct or mri scan  or when new lesions were absent but the clinical syndrome was consistent with stroke from admission to 3 months after the index stroke . 
 functional outcomes were assessed using the modified rankin scale ( mrs ) 3 months after the index stroke . 
 blood samples for lipid profiles were collected from the patients within 24 hours of admission and at a fasting state of more than 12 hours . 
 they were centrifuged to separate plasma or serum from the whole blood and then were stored at -70 until analysis could be performed . 
 the methods for measuring fa composition have been described previously.11 briefly  plasma total lipids were extracted according to the folch method18 and the phospholipid fraction was isolated by thin layer chromatography using a development solvent composed of hexane  diethyl ether  and acetic acid ( 80:20:2 ) . 
 the phospholipid fractions were then methylated to fa methyl esters ( fames ) by the lepage and roy method.19 the fames of individual fas of phospholipids were separated by gas chromatography using a model 6890 apparatus ( agilent technologies  palo alto  ca  usa ) and a 30 m omegawaz tm 250 capillary column ( supelco  bellefonte  pa  usa).20 peak retention times were obtained by comparison with known standards ( 37 component fame mix and pufa-2  supelco ; glc37  nucheck prep  elysian  mn  usa ) and analyzed with chemstation software ( agilent technologies ) . 
 the average of duplicate measurements for each sample was calculated.1121 plasma phospholipid fas were expressed as the percentage of total fas . 
 the sum (  ) of 16:0 palmitic acid  18:0 stearic acid  20:0 arachidonic acid  and 22:0 behenic acid was defined as the  saturated fatty acids ; 16:1 palmitoleic acid  18:1 9 oleic acid  and 22:1 erucic acid were defined as the  monounsaturated fatty acids ; 18:2 6 linolenic acid  18:3 6 -linolenic acid  20:3 6 dihomo--linolenic acid  and 20:4 6 arachidonic acid were defined as the  6-pufas ; and 18:3 3 -linolenic acid  20:3 3 5 - 8 - 11-eicosatrienoic acid  20:5 3 epa  and 22:6 3 dha were reported as the  3-pufas . 
 hypertension was defined as having resting systolic blood pressure 140 mmhg or diastolic blood pressure 90 mmhg on repeated measurements  or receiving treatment with anti - hypertensive medications . 
 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed when the patient had fasting blood glucose level 7.0 mmol / l  or was being treated with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin . 
 patients were defined as smokers  if they were smokers at the stroke event or if they had stopped smoking within 1 year before the stroke event . 
 body mass index was estimated by dividing body weight by height ( kg / m ) . 
 the presence of coronary artery disease was defined as a patient history of unstable angina  myocardial infarction  or angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease . 
 all statistical analyses were performed using the windows spss software package ( version 18.0  chicago  il  usa ) . 
 independent t test  mann - whitney u test  one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) with bonferroni post hoc analysis  and kruskal - wallis test were used to compare the continuous variables . 
 categorical variables were compared using the chi - square test or fisher 's exact test . 
 continuous variables were expressed as meansstandard deviations ( sd ) or as medians and interquartile ranges ( iqr ) . 
 univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to determine the factors associated with nihss at admission . 
 functional outcome was dichotomized into good outcome ( mrs <3 ) or poor outcome ( mrs 3 ) . 
 univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the predictive factors for functional outcome . to assess 
 the goodness of fit of the logistic regression model  cox & snell r square was calculated and the hosmer - lemeshow test was performed .

 there were six recurrent stroke cases and events  and epa was relatively lower in the recurrent group compared to the non - recurrent group ( 1.60.2 vs. 2.00.7  p=0.006 ) .

 our study revealed that 3-pufas  especially dha  were associated with stroke severity on hospital admission and poor functional outcome even after adjusting for the nihss score  which is considered a strong predictive factor for stroke outcome . 
 for example  treatment with dha - albumin complex in animal studies decreased brain injury after a transient and permanent focal cerebral ischaemia.22 dha showed anti - inflammatory and neuroprotective effects by decreasing oxidative stress via activation of nuclear factor e2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 expression and by attenuating c - jun phosphorylation  or the activating protein-1 signaling pathway.23 consistently  studies in humans have produced similar results . 
 one previous study in 281 japanese patients with acute ischemic stroke diagnosed within 24 hours of onset  showed that the epa / arachidonic acid ( aa ) ratio  dha / aa ratio  and the epa+dha / aa ratio were independently and negatively associated with early neurological deterioration.24 furthermore  a population - based study in the u.s.a  which included 2692 elderly adults without prevalence of stroke or cardiovascular disease  revealed that higher plasma 3-polyunsaturated fas ( epa  dha  and total 3 fas ) were associated with lower mortalities.25 overall  these previous studies showed that 3-pufas ( especially epa and dha ) were related to vascular outcome  which is in line with our study results . 
 however  the reason why epa was not independently associated with poor functional outcome in our study population remains to be elucidated . 
 dha exerts vasodilating properties by stimulating nitric oxide release in the vascular endothelium  and hence may also be responsible for decreasing heart rate variability and potentially for dyslipidemia improvement  effects not observed by epa.26 loss of nitric oxide control  heart rate variation  and dyslipidemia may be related to poor vascular disease outcome27 and our study results can be explained by the correlation observed with dha  and not epa  and with functional outcome . 
 in addition  the difference in race and staple food of the study population could represent another possible explanation . our results demonstrated a relationship between 3-pufas and stroke severity on hospital admission and poor functional outcomes  in both the large artery atherosclerosis and the small vessel occlusion stroke subtypes . 
 3-pufas give rise to anti - inflammatory molecules ( resolvins and protectins ) through lipoxygenase or cyclo - oxygenase pathways.2829 resolvins or protectins play an important role in the resolution of inflammation  which decreases atherosclerotic changes and tissue injuries . 
 because cerebral small vessel pathologies such as lacunar infarction  white matter changes  and cerebral microbleeds are linked to inflammatory reactions30 and increase arterial stiffness31 caused by progressive atherosclerosis  these anti - inflammatory and anti - atherogenic effects of 3-pufas could explain the results observed in our study . moreover  
 because progressive cerebral atherosclerosis is associated with a poor stroke outcome32 our finding relative to the association between 3-pufas and stroke prognosis may be valid . 
 in addition  the atherosclerotic plaque stabilization effect of 3-pufas may be an important mechanism . a previous study performed on patients awaiting carotid endarterectomy showed that plaques from patients treated with fish oil ( 1.4 g 3-polyunsaturated fas per day ) had a well - formed thick fibrous cap ( i.e. less vulnerable ) atheroma compared to that in patients of the placebo group.33 pathologically  infiltration of macrophages was less severe in patients treated with fish oil.33 furthermore  another prospective study confirmed that patients treated with fish oil had lower plaque inflammation and instability.34 because the vulnerability of the atherosclerotic plaque is a very important determinant of thrombosis - related stroke  as well as the degree of arterial stenosis  our results relative to the relationship between stroke outcome and 3-pufas is within expectation . 
 lastly  a recent study revealed that 3-pufas enhanced cerebral angiogenesis in animal models35 and because increased angiogenesis could augment brain repair and improve long - term functional recovery after cerebral infarction  these findings may support our study.35 one limitation of our study is that the blood samples were obtained from acute stroke patients on admission . 
 therefore  the fatty acids and their composition were not serially assessed during the time course of the stroke . 
 moreover  even though we prospectively enrolled our study subjects  our study design is mainly cross - sectional . 
 in addition  the short - term of observation with a small sample size is another limitation of this study . 
 further studies with a long - term follow - up and larger population size are needed . finally  our study design was not that of a randomized control study 
 . furthermore  because stroke severity on admission correlated with both lower proportion of 3-pufas and functional outcome at 3 months  there could be a bias due to the interaction between severity on admission and 3-pufas . 
 that is  there may be a possibility that the functional outcome at 3 months is only weakly associated with 3-pufas . 
 our results demonstrate that 3-pufa levels correlate with stroke severity at admission and functional outcomes at 3 months . 
 3-pufas may be considered potential blood biomarkers for prognosis of acute non - cardiogenic ischemic stroke patients . 
 comparison of proportions of 3-pufas according to stroke subtypes the relationship between fatty acids composition and stroke severity on admission according to stroke subtypes comparison of functional outcome based on occurrence of recurrent stroke the relationship between fatty acids composition and poor functional outcome according to stroke subtype",".

Title 1: Abstract
We studied whether plasma FA composition was related to stroke severity and functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients. Lower proportions of EPA, DHA, and 3-PUFAs were independently associated with higher NIHSS score, while lower proportions of DHA and 3-PUFAs correlated with worse functional outcomes at 3 months.

Title 2: Research and Discussion
A total of 156 patients with first-episode cerebral infarction were prospectively enrolled and analyzed using gas chromatography. Results showed that lower proportions of certain FAs were associated with greater stroke severity and poor functional outcomes. These findings suggest that FAs may serve as biomarkers for prognosis in ischemic stroke patients.

Title 3: Results and Conclusion
After adjusting for various factors, lower proportions of DHA and 3-PUFAs were independently associated with poor functional outcomes at 3 months. This highlights the potential of FAs as blood biomarkers for predicting prognosis in non-cardiogenic ischemic stroke patients. Further research in this area may lead to improved management and outcomes for stroke patients."
"prediction of mandibular growth pattern ( mgp ) plays an important role in orthodontic treatment planning ; it is critical when managing the development of dentofacial structures . 
 different methods have been introduced for predicting mgp and assessing  symphyseal morphology is one of them . 
 ricketts and others stated that morphology of the symphysis may be used to predict the direction of mandibular growth . 
 he found that forward inclination of the condylar head was associated with forward mandibular rotation  along with a greater curvature of the mandibular canal compared with mandibular contour . 
 a tendency toward backward mandibular rotation was associated with a pronounced apposition below the symphysis with more overall concavity of the inferior mandibular border . 
 jarabak 's cephalometric analysis predicted the direction of mandibular growth by a facial polygon  including the saddle angle ( n - s - ar )  articular angle ( s - ar - go )  and gonial angle ( ar - go - me ) ; a sum of these three angles greater than 396 is predictive of a posterior mgp while a sum less than 396 was associated with anterior mgp 
 . also a ratio of posterior ( s - go ) to anterior face height ( n - me ) of 56 - 62% indicated a posterior mgp  whereas a ratio of 65 - 80% indicated an anterior growth tendency . 
 although many cephalometric measurements have been introduced  it is still very difficult to accurately predict the direction of mandibular growth . 
 although  skieller 's four variables accounted for 86% of the variability of changes in the direction of mandibular growth ( mandibular inclination  intermolar angle  shape of the inferior border of the mandible  and inclination of the symphysis ) ; however  it accounted for only 8% in lee 's study . 
 thus  he concluded that predicting the direction of mandibular growth is very perplexing and problematic . 
 assessed symphyseal height  depth ratio ( h / d ) and angle . in his study  the morphology of the symphysis was found to be associated with the direction of mandibular growth . 
 a mandible with an anterior growth direction was associated with a small height  large depth  small ratio  and large angle of the symphysis . 
 conversely  a posterior growth direction was associated with a large height  small depth  large ratio  and small angle of the symphysis . 
 the purpose of this study was to evaluate symphyseal morphology ( height  depth  and height / depth ) in patients aged between 9 and 14 years with different sagittal and vertical mgps . 
 lateral cephalometric radiographs and charts of adolescents aged between 9 and 14 years were used in this study . 
 the first part of the study was conducted on 60 normal cephalograms taken from normal individuals according to normal occlusion defined by moyer 's and appropriate facial proportions were approved by two orthodontists . 
 the samples had no history of orthodontic treatment or history of systemic or developmental diseases . to find normal value for vertical growth pattern of mandible vertical indices  that is  the sum of bijork angles  gonial angle and sn - man angle were used . 
 wylie 's analysis was also used for assessing sagittal growth pattern of mandible  which included mandibular length and lower mandibular length . 
 the second part of the study was to define case groups  which included cl ii vertical  cl iii vertical  cl ii horizontal  and cl iii horizontal patients with normal maxillae . 
 the four case groups were those who were out of this range classified as horizontal or vertical growing patterns according to vertical indices and as cl ii or cl iii skeletal growing patterns according to wylie indices . 
 there were 15 samples in each group that were matched to normal groups according to sex and cervical maturation stage ( cvms ) . 
 baccetti 's method for evaluation of the cervical maturation stage the symphyseal measurement included height  depth  and ratio ( h / d ) measured according to the aki et al . 
 linear measurements used the tangent drawn at point b and parallel and perpendicular lines drawn to this tangent . 
 the method of measuring height and depth of the symphysis is shown in figure 2 . 
 cephalometric measurements used to quantify symphysis morphology all radiographs were taken with the same panoramic radiographic device ( planmeca proline x  helsinki  finland ) . 
 all of them were scanned and digitized ( dpi 300 )  and the measurements were made using dolphin imaging software  version 10 ( patterson dental supply  usa ) for symphyseal parameters  real size tracings were printed by dolphin imaging software and measured using a grid . 
 normal data distribution was evaluated by one sample k - s test and the levene test was performed to indicate variance equality between groups . 
 after confirmation of normality of the groups and equation of their variances  the two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) model was assessed by adjusted chi - square for analysis of data ( p 
 < 0.001 )  and the comparison of cases with the normal group was performed using the dunnett method . 
 for evaluation of intraobserver reliability  intraclass correlation coefficient ( icc ) was assessed and the reliability was approved ( icc coefficiency was between 0.0726 and 0.0871 ) .

 evaluation of 60 normal radiographs with the baccetti method showed that 21 were in stage iii  29 were in stage ii  and the remaining were in stage i. the case groups also were selected from the patients in stage iii and matched to 15 samples with normal radiographs  which were in the same stage . 
 mean and standard deviation of the sagittal and vertical parameters are shown in table 1 . 
 mean and standard deviation of mandibular parameters of sagittal and vertical analysis table 2 lists the height and depth of the symphysis based on sex and growth pattern in study groups . 
 comparison of each case group with normal group showed only statistically significant differences between the normal group and cl ii horizontal and cl iii vertical groups in height ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 mean and standard deviation of symphyseal height and depth in the normal group and four subgroups based on gender comparison of each case group with the normal group showed only statistically significant difference between it and the cl iii horizontal and cl ii vertical groups in depth ( p < 0.001 ) and no significant difference relevant to sex . table 3 shows the symphysis ratio relevant to sex and growth pattern .

 quantification of skeletal data has been shown to be an effective and reliable method of demonstrating variation in human growth as well as for monitoring and interpreting the growth of various skeletal elements in the living . 
 morphological changes in the mandibular body had been studied in previous researches  and it was found that the gonial angle became significantly smaller after the third molar eruption . also  the posterior mandibular body length had a linear correlation with gonial angle . 
 is symphysis morphology . due to ease in selection of landmarks for evaluating symphysis morphology in cephalograms 
 the characteristics of the normal subjects were mentioned in other studies . despite wide variations in the size and shape of the human face  head  and body  
  significant relationships were found between the measures of mandibular incisor crowding and basal bone dimensions in female subjects . except for the vestibular part of cancellous bone thickness  
 all mandibular incisor bone measurements were greater in the male subjects than in the female subjects . 
 we matched our study groups according to the baccetti 's skeletal age  in order to lower the developmental age effect on the mandibular growth . 
 the samples were also matched based on gender . in this way  the confounding effect of gender and skeletal age was minimized on mandibular growth . 
 it was also found that there was a sexual dimorphism on the morphology of the symphysis  with the mean symphyseal ratio being higher in the female samples than in the male samples . 
 this difference has been indicated in all studies on mandibular growth  because bone deposition in the pogonion region is an x - linked trait . 
 it was noticed that with horizontal growth patterns of the mandible whether in cl ii or cl iii  the symphyseal ratio was higher than in the normal group . in cases with vertical growth patterns 
 the height of the symphysis was greatest in cl iii vertical and the least in clii horizontal groups  with no significant difference in other subgroups . 
 regarding the depth of the symphysis  the greatest depth was measured in cl iii horizontal and the least was indicated in the cl ii vertical group . 
 the size and shape of the mandibular symphysis is an important consideration in evaluation of orthodontic patients . with a prominent symphysis  
 more protrusion of the incisors is esthetically acceptable and therefore a greater chance that a nonextraction approach to treatment may be considered . 
 conversely  in patients with greater symphyseal height and small chin  an extraction approach is preferred for compensation of arch length discrepancies . 
 this concept was confirmed by the results of our study because we measured the deepest depth in horizontal growth patterns ; therefore  we can use nonextraction approach in these individuals . furthermore in vertical growth patterns it is better to extract teeth because of the decreased symphyseal depth . 
 did a study to determine whether symphysis morphology could be used as a predictor of the direction of mandibular growth and to assess growth changes of the symphysis . 
 they determined the direction of mandibular growth based on vertical parameters and divided it into anterior and posterior growth patterns . 
 consequently  they subdivided the size of the symphysis into large  small  and medium . 
 symphysis morphology was found to be associated with the direction of mandibular growth  especially in male subjects with symphysis ratio having the strongest relationship in adults . 
 a mandible with an anterior growth direction was associated with a small height  large depth  small ratio  and large angle of the symphysis . 
 conversely  a posterior growth direction was associated with a large height  small depth  large ratio  and small angle of the symphysis . 
 symphyseal dimensions continued to change until adulthood with male subjects having a greater and later change compared with female subjects . 
 in addition  the ratio was low in horizontal growth ( anterior growth direction ) and the depth was greater . 
 it seems that based on both studies  the symphysis morphology is different in various vertical growth patterns of the mandible . 
 in summary  we can conclude that female adolescents had greater symphyseal ratio in comparison to male adolescents . 
 also  symphyseal depth differed significantly in vertical and horizontal growth patterns in comparison to normal groups and symphysis ratio ( height / depth ) was strongly related to the vertical pattern of mandibular growth in both genders .","

Abstract: This study investigated the symphyseal morphology in adolescents with different mandibular growth patterns. Four groups with malocclusion (Class III vertical, Class II vertical, Class III horizontal, and Class II horizontal) were compared to a normal group in terms of symphyseal height, depth, and ratio. Results showed a significant correlation between the symphyseal ratio and mandibular growth patterns.

Research and Discussion: The study used two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to analyze data and the Dunnett method to compare cases with the normal group. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate intraobserver reliability. This study confirmed the importance of considering mandibular growth patterns in assessing symphyseal morphology.

Results and Conclusion: The symphyseal ratio was found to be significantly associated with mandibular growth patterns. Specifically, a smaller ratio was seen in a vertical growth pattern while a larger ratio was seen in a horizontal growth pattern. The ratio was also found to be greater in females. This study emphasized the importance of considering the impact of mandibular growth patterns in assessing symphyseal morphology. "

"in modern nursing  nurses are expected to deliver holistic care  taking into account patients biological  psychosocial  and spiritual needs . 
 however  formal nursing programs in iran follow a biomedical approach that focuses mainly on medical problems.[35 ] these formal education programs focus on the transfer of knowledge and the mastery of techniques related to patient physical care ; however  students also learn informally through hidden curricula of nursing education . 
 direct observation of situations  such as birth  death  loss  and suffering results in emotional learning . 
 additionally  students gain experience through interactions with each other  teachers  and senior professionals  known as peer learning  which studies have found can have life - long effects on students . 
 the limited scope of formal nursing education in iran may result in informal learning experience for nursing students that differs from those of other countries . 
 if nursing education recognizes this informal learning and its achievements may be able to take advantages of these opportunities to improve students competency . 
 informal or indirect learning can occur as a function of observing  retaining  and replicating behaviors during educational experiences . 
 the aim of this qualitative study was to explore the perceived informal learning achievements in undergraduate nursing programs from the iranian student perspective . 
 this study was designed to answer the question : what are undergraduate nursing student perceptions of the informal learning that occurs during nursing studies ? 
 this study was conducted over a 2-year period ( 2009 - 2010 ) using a qualitative content analysis . 
 the participants were 14 nursing students in their fourth year of study at  x  university who were recruited through a purposeful sampling method . 
 they were at their final stage of clinical apprenticeship so had passed major part of their education and could share their achievements of learning experiences  including informal ones . 
 sampling was done according to the maximum variant approach in terms of gender  age  marital status  geographical location ( local or not local )  student work experience  and level of academic achievement ( e.g.  good  average  or superior ) . 
 each interview began with the open question :  apart from the theoretical and practical knowledge you gained during four years of nursing study  what other changes do you think you have experienced during your study ? 
 answers were explored more deeply with relevant probing statements or questions  such as : 
 please tell me more about that    how did that make you feel ? 
 please describe an actual experience you have had that will help me understand what it meant to you .  the interviews lasted an average of 70 min  usually in a single session . 
 each interview was transcribed verbatim  and then converted to rich text format for use in maxqda software  which facilitated data management . 
 data were analyzed through a constant comparison analysis method using strauss and corbin coding techniques to develop the categories . 
 data were analyzed initially by the main author  then the emerging codes were revised independently by 2 other members of the research team . throughout coding and category development  
 the analysis process and the accuracy of codes and categories were discussed and checked in regular sessions ; discrepancies were resolved through continuing discussion and analysis . 
 lincoln and guba ( 1985 ) criteria were used to address trustworthiness ( p.296 ) . 
 dependability was gained by precise documentation of data  methods  and decisions about the research . 
 credibility was established through participant confirmation of our understanding  prolonged engagements with participants  a peer check  and an external check . throughout the study  
 data were managed by maxqda and all analysis precisely documented to maintain an audit trail . 
 student participation was voluntary . written information about the purpose of the study and confidentiality management was delivered to all participants and written consent was obtained for the study  including permission for recording the entire interview for transcribing . 
 the 14 participants consisted of 3 male and 11 female nursing students  age 21 - 23 years  in the last semester of their studies . based on students experiences  
 5 categories were extracted : personal maturity and emotional growth  social development  closeness to god  alterations in value systems  and ethical and professional commitments [ table 1 ] . although some participants described the process leading to their internal changes as challenging and difficult  almost all of them stated that it facilitated their growth as a whole person . 
 students achievements of informal learning during nursing study this category consisted of 2 subcategories : personal maturity ( consisting of self - awareness and self - discovery  accelerated mental maturity  and more open - mindedness ) and emotional growth ( consisting of greater patience  appreciation  kindness  and compassion  and altruism ) . 
 the participants viewed their 4 years in nursing school as an opportunity for gaining a deeper self - awareness and self - knowledge . 
 they believed that the duties of nursing practice  such as frequent personal interactions and development of relationships  have great influence on deep reflection about humanity as well as their personal beliefs . 
 in contrast  the importance of rigorous assessment throughout nursing studies resulted in regular self - assessment in their daily lives . 
 these helped them obtain more realistic knowledge about their personal strengths  weaknesses  and talents . 
 some participants described this awareness as self - discovery by saying :  i learned about myself based on what they taught us about humans in the program . 
 i understood myself  in the university setting  through the eyes of my friends  who criticized me . 
 another significant change reported by students was an increasing maturity of mind that resulted in more rational behavior . 
 the frequent exposure to life - and - death situations in nursing helped promote maturity . 
 one student said :  my personality developed at this school . at first  i behaved very childishly . 
 there were a series of realities of which i was wholly ignorant ; i acquired them here in the school .  they also attributed this increase in maturity to multiple factors  including interactions with instructors  senior students  and people with various personalities  as well as engagement in difficult situations . 
 one participant said :  this maturity has been partly influenced by interactions with professional instructors and encounters with classmates as well as senior students 
 i improved little by little through experiencing critical situations  seeing the darker side of life  the troubles and pains of other people  all of which i was unaware of in my previous relaxed lifestyle . 
 the other significant experience reported by participants was increasing open - mindedness . with respect to the principles of fundamental nursing classes  they learned to focus on a patient as a human being  regardless of nationality  ethnicity  religious beliefs  or financial or sociocultural status . 
 as a result  students reported that they were able to accept people by adopting a nonjudgmental manner . 
 one student  who was caring for people with various religious beliefs  described her primary concern about encountering clients with different beliefs as a challenging experience and explained how she successfully overcame those conflicts by overlooking religious prejudices . 
 she said :  at first i thought i had treated them differently ; well  one patient was muslim  the other held another belief . 
 however  after a while  i realized that they are ultimately human  and my job was not to judge the belief system of people . 
 then the differences were no longer serious or problematic and i found myself adapting easily by getting closer to them . 
 i am very grateful to be able to communicate well with various religious minorities despite so many differences . 
 some of them said that they learned patience from patients who were suffering from chronic illnesses . 
 when they saw how these patients worked to manage the disease and its disabling consequences  they realized the triviality of their own problems . 
 i had patients who underwent dialysis every day  yet were quite happy  spoke with joy  laughed  and induced others to be in a good mood . in comparison with them  how could i concern myself with minor issues while i was in good health physically and emotionally ? 
 i felt embarrassed when i saw them struggle steadfastly with such pain  illness  and deprivation . 
 other participants believed that the patience resulting from the nature of discipline made them stronger to handle difficulties . 
 one participant stated :  nowadays the problems do not exhaust my spirit . since in nursing practice 
 you see the pains and troubles of other people  a series of problems are no longer considered problems  or perhaps your experiences and abilities have improved . 
 you should be more patient  in order to help those people who need you and have their hope invested in you . 
 they said seeing patients suffer made them realize the importance of the gifts they took for granted  especially the gift of health : 
 now i see patients with their problems and realize the gifts i have in my life  which i did nt appreciate before . 
 they also explained that nursing made them similar to mothers - kind and ready to help and show compassion . 
 now they feel a stronger sense of love and concern for humankind as well as the ability to love and care for others . 
 one of them indicated :  studying in the nursing field gives you the sense of being a mother . 
 they teach us that we must be able to establish good communication  and understand others and support them . 
 one participant stated :  generally  my morale and personality is such that i really like people . 
 it seems that these traits were developed for inner satisfaction and for the affection you can induce in others . 
 the second category derived from the interviews was related to becoming more social and expert in interpersonal relationships . some of the participants  especially those who had limited communication skills before entering the program  acknowledged nursing studies as a turning point that improved their social relationships . 
 they asserted that gaining communication skills with patients in clinical settings as fundamental to improving their interpersonal proficiency by saying :  nursing improved my communication with others . 
 i  who had a habit of building fences around me  was forced out of that closed space . during this period  
 my communication skills got much stronger  since they are required and necessary skills in nursing .  encouraging and developing communication with patients required students to exploit strategies  such as developing cultural and ideological common ground  respecting others interests and wishes  and adapting themselves to others . 
 gradually they noticed they were applying these advanced communication skills in their personal life . 
 now  i can look at the subject from his / her point of view . 
 i take the initiative and try to begin from a point that is welcomed by the other party . 
 another factor that contributed to students social development was existing in a social environment larger than that of high school  which involved interaction with a heterogeneous population from various towns  ethnic groups  and cultures  which was regarded as expanding  the friends circle  by participants : 
 i do nt limit myself to making friends with people of my own type ; i always search for new thoughts and new ideas with their own experiences . 
 nonlocal participants  who resided in the student dormitory during their studies  explained the significant influence of living in the dormitory on their social growth and development as : 
 when you become a college student and live in the dormitory with other students coming from different places and cultures with various upbringings  you are obliged to encounter them  and automatically learn how to adapt yourself and in fact be flexible . 
 since all participants were muslim  a belief in god was one fundamental characteristic . however  most of them stated that they experienced a different type of connection with god during their nursing studies . 
 some of them attributed this new belief to gaining a deeper knowledge about the intricacies of the human body and about human beings in general during the nursing program : 
 i understood the complexities of this perfect system ( the human body )  how accurately it has been designed  and how many problems are caused by a small deviation . 
 we were told that the patients do nt respond to any treatment  but they did and i saw with my own eyes the effect of the prayers that the person accompanying the patient offered from the depths of the heart  and how it worked . 
 i touched god s power and presence .  others stated they felt closer to god through nursing practice because they were satisfying god s wishes by caring for the most vulnerable . 
 this optimism significantly improved the quality of their prayers and replaced traditional ceremonies with enthusiastic worship and inner dialog with god . 
 this type of close connection with god led to a pleasant feeling of dependency  which made them calmer when confronting difficulties :  now i feel that god is looking at me  for my interest in caring for his people . 
 i tell myself since i serve god s people sincerely ; certainly he would also pay attention to me ... i have noticed that whenever i have troubles  they are resolved at once . 
 i sense some resolution and interpret it as god s promise that  if you help someone  god will help you in return . 
 participants believed that confrontation with the light as well as the dark side of life in nursing expanded their world view through a change in focus from living a superficial life to a life more concerned with serious and substantive matters beyond their calendar age . 
 one participant explained :  in nursing  you see the beginning of life  and the termination of it . 
 you are faced with certain facts that make other issues trivial and insignificant in life while they are still important for your peers . 
 these challenging confrontations acted as awakening experiences  allowing students to obtain a new perspective about life and death that stimulated changes in their value systems . as a result 
 they described these alterations as achieving a deeper and more realistic point of view of life :  now my objectives for the future have changed in principle . 
 whenever i see patients who have only a few days to live  i no longer waste my time . 
 before  i had a child - like view of life as a bowl of cherries with no worries  but now i know that life has its own hardships  which are considered a part of life . 
 moreover  most of them asserted that they feel they were chosen by god for this profession and they appreciated it as an opportunity for growth and transcendence . 
 i sensed that i was invited by god to take a right path that changed my destiny forever . 
 i began taking steps on a road that i was supposed to begin with and i interpreted this as special attention to me on god s part ... i believe that we were summoned by god . 
 nurses were invited for their kind heart  for their sympathy  and for their ability to provide relaxation to patients . 
 if you knew this from the beginning and you appreciated being invited  any experience along the way would become important and valuable to you . 
 most participants admitted that they feel a strong commitment to their work and try to be conscientious in the care of their patients . 
 they believed that this inner commitment had a stronger influence than any rules or external controls . 
 some of them attributed this inner commitment to their increased closeness to god and consequent sense of being observed constantly by god . 
 they were delighted by this connection and attention so they tried to sustain this perceived attention by working ethically and conscientiously . 
 even though i can work unsterile and the patient may not know it  i notice what i do and god does  too . 
 however  your ethical commitment forces you to work better . to me  respecting the patient s rights is more important than anything else . 
 i always tell myself to imagine that the patient is one of your dear siblings . 
 i always try to hold that thought and work according to such feelings to do my best .  in addition  participants attributed this commitment to other reasons  such as respecting patient s rights and dignity to enjoy humanistic and proper care as a human being  responding their inner desire to do their best as a nurse  and trying to improve nursing image in society . 
 one participant related her sense of ethical and professional commitment to satisfaction of her inner philanthropic desire :  to me  it does not matter whether someone see or appreciate my efforts or ethically working . doing my best firstly as a human  secondly as a nurse satisfies me  
 so it is enough to follow my inner voice and desire to work as well as i can to help a needy patient to make him / her condition better .

 she said :  at first i thought i had treated them differently ; well  one patient was muslim  the other held another belief . however  after a while  i realized that they are ultimately human  and my job was not to judge the belief system of people . 
 then the differences were no longer serious or problematic and i found myself adapting easily by getting closer to them . 
 i am very grateful to be able to communicate well with various religious minorities despite so many differences . 
 almost all of the participants indicated that increasing patience was their most significant change . 
 some of them said that they learned patience from patients who were suffering from chronic illnesses . 
 when they saw how these patients worked to manage the disease and its disabling consequences  they realized the triviality of their own problems . 
 i had patients who underwent dialysis every day  yet were quite happy  spoke with joy  laughed  and induced others to be in a good mood . in comparison with them  
 how could i concern myself with minor issues while i was in good health physically and emotionally ? 
 i felt embarrassed when i saw them struggle steadfastly with such pain  illness  and deprivation . 
 other participants believed that the patience resulting from the nature of discipline made them stronger to handle difficulties . 
 since in nursing practice you see the pains and troubles of other people  a series of problems are no longer considered problems  or perhaps your experiences and abilities have improved . 
 you should be more patient  in order to help those people who need you and have their hope invested in you . 
 they said seeing patients suffer made them realize the importance of the gifts they took for granted  especially the gift of health : 
 now i see patients with their problems and realize the gifts i have in my life  which i did nt appreciate before . 
 they also explained that nursing made them similar to mothers - kind and ready to help and show compassion . 
 now they feel a stronger sense of love and concern for humankind as well as the ability to love and care for others . 
 one of them indicated :  studying in the nursing field gives you the sense of being a mother . 
 they teach us that we must be able to establish good communication  and understand others and support them . 
 one participant stated :  generally  my morale and personality is such that i really like people . 
 it seems that these traits were developed for inner satisfaction and for the affection you can induce in others . 
 the second category derived from the interviews was related to becoming more social and expert in interpersonal relationships . 
 some of the participants  especially those who had limited communication skills before entering the program  acknowledged nursing studies as a turning point that improved their social relationships . 
 they asserted that gaining communication skills with patients in clinical settings as fundamental to improving their interpersonal proficiency by saying :  nursing improved my communication with others . 
 i  who had a habit of building fences around me  was forced out of that closed space . during this period 
  my communication skills got much stronger  since they are required and necessary skills in nursing .  encouraging and developing communication with patients required students to exploit strategies  such as developing cultural and ideological common ground  respecting others interests and wishes  and adapting themselves to others . 
 gradually they noticed they were applying these advanced communication skills in their personal life . 
 now  i can look at the subject from his / her point of view . 
 i take the initiative and try to begin from a point that is welcomed by the other party . 
 i moved away from a partial and limited understanding of others and i feel that i am growing in regards to social relations in general . 
 another factor that contributed to students social development was existing in a social environment larger than that of high school  which involved interaction with a heterogeneous population from various towns  ethnic groups  and cultures  which was regarded as expanding  the friends circle  by participants :  i tried to experience all group types . 
 i do nt limit myself to making friends with people of my own type ; i always search for new thoughts and new ideas with their own experiences . 
 nonlocal participants  who resided in the student dormitory during their studies  explained the significant influence of living in the dormitory on their social growth and development as : 
 when you become a college student and live in the dormitory with other students coming from different places and cultures with various upbringings  you are obliged to encounter them  and automatically learn how to adapt yourself and in fact be flexible . 
 since all participants were muslim  a belief in god was one fundamental characteristic . however  most of them stated that they experienced a different type of connection with god during their nursing studies . 
 some of them attributed this new belief to gaining a deeper knowledge about the intricacies of the human body and about human beings in general during the nursing program : 
 i understood the complexities of this perfect system ( the human body )  how accurately it has been designed  and how many problems are caused by a small deviation . 
 we were told that the patients do nt respond to any treatment  but they did and i saw with my own eyes the effect of the prayers that the person accompanying the patient offered from the depths of the heart  and how it worked . 
 i touched god s power and presence .  others stated they felt closer to god through nursing practice because they were satisfying god s wishes by caring for the most vulnerable . 
 this optimism significantly improved the quality of their prayers and replaced traditional ceremonies with enthusiastic worship and inner dialog with god . 
 this type of close connection with god led to a pleasant feeling of dependency  which made them calmer when confronting difficulties :  now i feel that god is looking at me  for my interest in caring for his people . 
 i tell myself since i serve god s people sincerely ; certainly he would also pay attention to me ... i have noticed that whenever i have troubles  they are resolved at once . 
 i sense some resolution and interpret it as god s promise that  if you help someone  god will help you in return . 
 participants believed that confrontation with the light as well as the dark side of life in nursing expanded their world view through a change in focus from living a superficial life to a life more concerned with serious and substantive matters beyond their calendar age . 
 one participant explained :  in nursing  you see the beginning of life  and the termination of it . 
 you are faced with certain facts that make other issues trivial and insignificant in life while they are still important for your peers . 
 these challenging confrontations acted as awakening experiences  allowing students to obtain a new perspective about life and death that stimulated changes in their value systems . as a result 
 they described these alterations as achieving a deeper and more realistic point of view of life :  now my objectives for the future have changed in principle . 
 whenever i see patients who have only a few days to live  i no longer waste my time . 
 before  i had a child - like view of life as a bowl of cherries with no worries  but now i know that life has its own hardships  which are considered a part of life . 
 moreover  most of them asserted that they feel they were chosen by god for this profession and they appreciated it as an opportunity for growth and transcendence . 
 i sensed that i was invited by god to take a right path that changed my destiny forever . 
 i began taking steps on a road that i was supposed to begin with and i interpreted this as special attention to me on god s part ... i believe that we were summoned by god . 
 nurses were invited for their kind heart  for their sympathy  and for their ability to provide relaxation to patients . 
 if you knew this from the beginning and you appreciated being invited  any experience along the way would become important and valuable to you . 
 most participants admitted that they feel a strong commitment to their work and try to be conscientious in the care of their patients . 
 they believed that this inner commitment had a stronger influence than any rules or external controls . 
 some of them attributed this inner commitment to their increased closeness to god and consequent sense of being observed constantly by god . 
 they were delighted by this connection and attention so they tried to sustain this perceived attention by working ethically and conscientiously . 
 even though i can work unsterile and the patient may not know it  i notice what i do and god does  too . 
 however  your ethical commitment forces you to work better . to me  respecting the patient s rights is more important than anything else . 
 i always tell myself to imagine that the patient is one of your dear siblings . 
 i always try to hold that thought and work according to such feelings to do my best .  in addition  participants attributed this commitment to other reasons  such as respecting patient s rights and dignity to enjoy humanistic and proper care as a human being  responding their inner desire to do their best as a nurse  and trying to improve nursing image in society . 
 one participant related her sense of ethical and professional commitment to satisfaction of her inner philanthropic desire :  to me  it does not matter whether someone see or appreciate my efforts or ethically working . doing my best firstly as a human  secondly as a nurse satisfies me  
 so it is enough to follow my inner voice and desire to work as well as i can to help a needy patient to make him / her condition better . 
 since students who felt more personal growth were more eager to participate in the study  it is possible that other students experiences have been ignored unintentionally by the researchers . according to the results of this study  the undergraduate nursing students achieved knowledge and insights that were not provided by the formal  biomedical - centered  nursing program . 
 these included the following : personal maturity and emotional development  social development  greater closeness to god  an alteration in value systems  and ethical and professional commitment . 
 these are nontechnical professional competencies that are important to the goals of the nursing curriculum . 
 although these are not included in a specific lesson  they are beyond theoretical knowledge and the technical skills and could be considered as the soul of nursing education . 
 the results indicate that nursing students develop important qualities through a  hidden curriculum  that help fulfill the mission of nursing education in creating ethical  spiritual  legal  and professional values . in this study  one of the most important categories was personal growth  which included self - awareness  self - knowledge  and self - discovery due to frequent interactions with patients and other people and reflection on the experiences of these relationships . 
 the meaning of this category was compatible with that of a previous study  indicating a self - awareness theme related to experiences of being and presence . 
 participants in the previous study also experienced nurse - patient interactions that resulted in self - awareness . 
 the participants who increased self - awareness did so through reflection  and found meaning in being a nurse . 
 chiu the outcome of university courses are not limited to professional development ; they also promoted the personal growth of nurses . 
 being a nurse requires compassion  respect  and humanity . in the present study  participants described nursing as an opportunity to gain empathy and other humanistic feelings . 
 they appreciated the characteristics  such as patience  thankfulness  kindness  compassion  and concern about humankind  that could help them achieve emotional growth . 
 emotional growth means the increasing capacity to recognize one s own emotions and allow them to mature . 
 wilson  stated that nursing students develop emotional competence by critical reflection through classroom sessions and clinical experiences . 
 the participants in the present study also indicated that reflection occurred outside formal sessions in the classroom . because nursing is a profession involving difficult situations  nursing students need preparation to mature enough to successfully handle their professional role  especially during a crisis . 
 studies reveal that nurses younger than 30 years experience greater burnout than their older counterparts . 
 such findings support the idea that emotional issues should be addressed in nursing curricula to nurture a healthier and more competent nursing workforce . 
 the participants in the present study also emphasized improvement in interpersonal and communication skills as a result of their nursing studies . 
 they believed that nursing taught them to put themselves in the patient s place and see through their eyes  which increased the awareness of patients feelings  perceptions  and needs . 
 these critical abilities are referred to as social growth qualities  gained through interactions with professors  classmates  roommates  and patients while out of the classroom . 
 although our participants were muslims  who must maintain a respectful distance from members of the opposite sex that can interfere with some nursing tasks  findings indicated that even the strongly religious female participants did not have problems caring for male patients . 
 another aspect of nursing training that affected students in this study was their relationship with god . from an islamic perspective 
 additionally  nursing is considered a divine profession in iran . in this ideologic context  
 almost all of the study participants appreciated nursing as a call from god toward transcendence . 
 ravari et al . also reported that the perception of nursing as an opportunity to worship god is a common belief among iranian nurses  which provided their career a transcendental meaning . 
 the study participants reported changes in their value systems  such as finding a deeper meaning beyond the superficial activities of everyday life and more lasting goals and values . 
 university studies provided an awakening experience  and inspired students to re - evaluate and redefine their personal values . 
 since universities are expected to help students achieve a broader perspective  nursing education should help promote student receptivity of human values compatible with their professional mission . 
 indicated that empathizing with patients and caring about their feelings initiates an ethical reflection process in nursing students that may eventually lead to the development of a set of personal values . 
 the last category revealed that  although the participants were just starting their career  they gained a sense of professional and ethical commitment . in a similar study by rahimaghaee et al 
  participant views about commitment went beyond work commitment to include an inner commitment related to a belief in god s supervision of their lives  including their careers . 
 additionally  le duc and kotzer  found that even novice nurses can hold professional values  indicating that nursing education can initiate a sense of professional commitment in students . 
 according to some nursing theorists  including watson  nursing schools should acknowledge the  hidden learning  that occurs outside the classroom can foster and facilitate development of students as whole human beings  not just professional nurses . according to watson  curriculum development should combine and integrate the cognitive with education about beauty  art  ethics  intuition  esthetics  and spirituality of human - to - human interactions within nursing . the nursing discipline needs to incorporate this type of curriculum to improve nursing student s personal development . during their education  
 this aspect of nursing was reported by paterson and zedrad ( 2007 ) in their humanistic nursing theory . 
 the findings of this study revealed that nursing education  especially clinical training with its patient - student interactions  provides an excellent opportunity for student personal growth that is less likely in other majors . through their studies  
 nursing students do not gain expertise in theoretical and technical matters alone  but also fulfill their potential as a whole person . 
 nursing education can prepare students to deliver holistic care only if they consider all aspects of the students as humans . 
 the ability to provide holistic care of patients requires treating each nursing student as a whole person through both formal and informal education . 
 this idea agrees with theories of student development that consider college education as involving the whole person and as a process involving interaction between intellectual development and interpersonal competence . therefore  
 recognizing and encouraging covert aspects of nursing education as well as overt ones provide more opportunities for student development  not only in cognitive and technical domains but also in affective ones . 
 this can help bring nursing education closer to the ideal of comprehensiveness that enables nurses to care holistically for patients .","

Abstract:
This qualitative study explored undergraduate nursing student perceptions of informal learning during their nursing education. Data from semi-structured interviews with 14 students were analyzed using Strauss and Corbin's constant comparison approach. Results revealed the impact of informal learning on personal and emotional development, social growth, values and ethics, and professional commitment.

Research and Discussion:
The study highlights the lack of information about informal learning in nursing education and its influence on students' character and practice. Findings suggest that informal learning plays a significant role in shaping students' nontechnical skills and can enhance their overall competence. Further research is needed in this area to better understand the potential of informal learning in nursing education.

Results and Conclusion:
The categories that emerged from the data analysis include personal maturity, social development, closeness to god, alterations in value systems, and ethical and professional commitment. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating informal learning opportunities into nursing education to promote holistic development of students. Implications for nursing education are discussed, including the need for educators to recognize and utilize informal learning opportunities in their teaching methods."
"the in   vitro ageing of human diploid   fibroblasts ( hdfs )  first described by   hayflick and moorhead  has become a classical experimental model to study cellular ageing . 
 hdfs have a limited ability to divide when cultured in   vitro . normally after about 50 cell divisions  
 hdfs enter a state of irreversible proliferative arrest  termed as replicative senescence or cellular senescence . 
 cells with less than 10 passages were considered young cells with high proliferative ability while cultures at 1020 passages have entered an intermediate state or pre - senescence  and cultures of over 25 passages with no detectable doubling in cell numbers for 2 weeks were considered as senescent cells . 
 senescent cells have been shown to accumulate with age in human tissues and  thus  have been suggested to contribute to organismal ageing . 
 reactive oxygen species ( ros ) were implicated in replicative senescence and ageing . during physiological metabolism  endogenous ros which include superoxide anion  hydrogen peroxide  hydroxyl radicals  and singlet oxygen 
 accumulation of oxidatively damaged cellular macromolecules is suggested to account for the free radical theory of ageing .   upon entering the state of senescence 
 the cell size or volume is increased with accumulation of cellular debris and intracellular vesicles  many of which are lysosomes . it has been reported that senescent fibroblasts became flattened and more irregular in shape   with increased expression of senescence marker such as senescence associated -galactosidase ( sa--gal ) . 
 both in   vitro and in   vivo studies have shown the increase in percentage of cells positive for sa--gal with cumulative population doublings ( cpds ) and age . nevertheless  the mechanisms that are responsible for the continuous cell growth and increased in sa--gal expression in senescent cells have not been well elucidated . 
 cell cycle checkpoints sense damage of the dna structure and elicit complex cellular repair response . 
 the checkpoints maintain cell cycle arrest while the repair takes place followed by cell cycle progression once repair is completed . 
 cells undergo permanent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis if the dna can not be repaired adequately . 
 a permanent cell cycle arrest occurs with cells remaining in g0/g1 phase during senescence . besides oxidative dna damage accumulation  
 telomere shortening has been widely considered as another important mechanism to trigger replicative senescence in human fibroblasts . 
 significant telomere shortening occurred as a consequence of prolonged h2o2 treatment but not in acute treatment . 
 .   showed that telomere shortening was largely dependent on the interplay of oxidative stress and antioxidant defence rather than the cell divisions . 
 a comparison of the telomere shortening rates in different hdfs under different conditions revealed that the ratio between oxidative damage and antioxidative defence was quantitatively the most important determinant of telomere shortening . to prevent progressive dna loss with subsequent rounds of dna replication  
 many cells maintain their telomeres by the action of telomerase  a specialized rna - protein complex that uses its rna component as a template for the extension of the telomere by its reverse transcriptase subunit .   in the absence of an adequate repair system  
 accumulated dna damage caused mutagenic alterations resulting in cancer  ageing  and abnormalities in the nervous system . accumulating 
 evidence demonstrated that vitamin e  the most potent lipid peroxyl radical scavenger  significantly reduced free radical - induced chromosomal damage . 
 vitamin e has been shown to reduce h2o2-induced oh generation and subsequent dna base pair modification in human oral epithelial cells   and h2o2-induced dna strand breaks in human skin cell line vh10 . 
 measurement of dna repair ability tested in lymphocytes indicated that vitamin e increased the removal rate of damaged dna compared to cells that are not treated with vitamin e . 
 natural vitamin e comprises of eight different isomers ; they are -  -  -  and -tocopherols and -  -  -  and -tocotrienols . based on its lipophilicity  vitamin e is considered to be the major chain - breaking antioxidant preventing the propagation of oxidative stress  especially in biological membranes . 
 vitamin e specifically -tocopherol has been reported to be able to modulate signal transduction and gene expression via its antioxidant and non - antioxidant properties . 
 recently  the different isomers of tocotrienol have gained increasing scientific interest due to their eminent antioxidant effects and a non - antioxidant activity profile that differs from tocopherols . 
 tocotrienols are found in abundance in rice bran  palm oil  oat  and barley . 
 tocotrienol - rich fraction consists of -tocopherol and four isomers of tocotrienols (       and  )  all of which are potent membrane - soluble antioxidants .   the differences in the properties of tocotrienol have suggested protective effects in diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer in experimental animals . in an animal model of ageing  tocotrienol extended lifespan by 19% while reducing protein carbonylation  a particularly toxic oxidation process indicative of ageing . since oxidants contribute to the ageing process and ageing - related diseases in many species  possible protection from ageing by antioxidants such as tocotrienol and tocopherol is suggested .   even though beneficial effects of vitamin e have been established in ageing 
  ongoing studies are being done to determine mechanisms involved and actual response of different stages of cellular ageing . in view of this  this study was designed to evaluate the molecular mechanism of tocotrienol - rich fraction in possibly modulating different stages of cellular ageing in hdfs by determining the changes in molecular markers of cell - ageing sa--gal  dna damage  telomere shortening  and cell cycle progression in young  presenescent  and senescent hdfs . 
 this research has been approved by the ethics committee of national university of malaysia ( approval project code : ff-218 - 2008 ) . 
 primary hdfs were derived from the foreskins of three 9- to 12-year - old boys after circumcision . 
 the samples were aseptically collected and washed several times with 75% alcohol and phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) containing 1% antibiotic - antimycotic solution ( paa  austria ) . after removing the epidermis 
  the pure dermis was cut into small pieces and transferred into a falcon tube containing 0.03% collagenase type i solution ( worthington biochemical corporation  usa ) . 
 pure dermis was digested in the incubator shaker at 37c for 612  h. then  cells were rinsed with pbs before being cultured in dulbecco modified eagle medium ( dmem ) containing 10% fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) ( paa  austria ) and 1% antibiotic - antimycotic solution at 37c in 5% co2 humidified incubator . 
 after 56 days  the cultured hdfs were harvested by trypsinization and culture - expand into new t25 culture flasks ( nunc  denmark ) with expansion degree of 1  :  4 . 
 when the subcultures reached 8090% confluence  serial passaging was done by trypsinization and the number of population doublings ( pds ) was monitored until hdfs reached senescence . for subsequent experiments  
 cells were used at either passage 4 ( young cell  population doubling ; pd < 12 )  passage 15 ( presenescent cell  30 < pd < 40 )  and passage 30 ( senescent cell  pd > 55 ) .   cell viability study was performed using mts assay . 
 briefly  stock solutions of trf gold tri e 50 ( golden hope bioganic sdn bhd  malaysia ) was freshly prepared in 100% ethanol ( 1  :  1 ) and kept at 20c for not more than one month . 
 serial dilutions of trf at concentrations of 0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  and 0.5  mg / ml were prepared in culture medium mixed with 50% ethanol ( 1  :  1 ) . 
  the medium was replaced with new medium containing the various concentrations of trf and incubated for 24  h at 37c  in 5% co2 . 
 after incubation  20  l mts was added and cells were further incubated for 2  h. the absorbance of mts formazan formed was measured at 490  nm with a microtiter plate reader ( veramax molecular devices  usa ) . 
 the viability assay was performed to obtain the optimum dose of trf treatment for subsequent experiments . in the subsequent experiments  
 treated hdfs were incubated with 0.5  mg / ml trf for 24  h while untreated cells were cultured in dulbecco modified eagle medium ( dmem ) containing 10% fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) ( paa  austria ) . 
 sa--gal staining was performed with a senescent cell staining kit ( sigma  usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
 a total of 1  10 cells in the trf - treated and control groups were seeded in six - well plates and incubated with fixation buffer ( 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde ) for 67  mins at room temperature . 
 cells were then rinsed three times with pbs and incubated with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl -d - galactopyranoside at 1  mg / ml in a buffer containing 40  mm citric acid / phosphate ( ph 6.0 )  5  mm k3fecn6  5  mm k4fecn6  150  mm nacl  and 2  mm mgcl2 for 4  h at 37c in the absence of co2 . 
 blue staining was visible after incubation  and the percentage of blue cells observed in 100 cells under a light microscope was calculated . 
 telomere assay was performed using telotaggg   telomere   length   assay   kit ( roche  usa ) that determined telomere length using terminal restriction fragment principle . 
 three g of dna was digested with 20 units each of hinfi and rsai for 2  h at 37c . 
 fractionated dna fragments were transferred to nylon membranes hybond - n ( amersham  uk ) by an alkaline transfer technique using capillary blotting . 
 the blotted dna fragments were hybridized to a digoxigenin ( dig)-labeled probe specific for telomeric repeats ( ttaggg ) for 3  h at 42c with gentle agitation with a dig - specific antibody covalently coupled to alkaline phosphatase . 
 finally  the immobilized telomere probe was visualized by alkaline phosphatase metabolizing cdp - star  a highly sensitive chemiluminescence substrate . 
 the average terminal restriction fragment length was determined by comparing signals relative to a nuclear weight standard on x - ray film . 
 the average terminal restriction fragment length of each sample was obtained by scanning the exposed x - ray film and quantifying using imagemaster total lab software . 
 detection of telomerase activity using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol ( trap ) in cultured cells involves the addition of ttaggg repeats by telomerase to an oligonucleotide ( ts ) and the subsequent pcr amplification of these extension products with both the forward ( ts ) and reverse ( cx ) primers . 
 the trapeze telomerase detection kit ( chemicon  usa ) was used as recommended by the manufacturer with minor modifications . 
 the lysis buffer contained 1% nonidet p-40 and 0.25  mm sodium deoxycholate to increase the efficiency of extraction . 
 cells were lysed  then left on ice for 30  min  and centrifuged at 14000  g for 20  min at 4c . 
 the extracted protein concentration was determined from bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) standard plot of od595 versus g bsa based on bradford method . for the pcr reaction  
 the total counts in the sample was added to 48  l reaction mixture and 2 units of taq dna polymerase ( promega  usa ) . 
 after incubation at room temperature for 30  min for the telomerase extension reaction  samples were heated to 92c for 3  min to inactivate telomerase followed by pcr amplification . 
 pcr products were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gel  and the gel was further analysed and quantitated using the imagemaster total lab software . 
 telomerase activity was calculated as the ratio of the intensity of telomerase ladders to the intensity of the 36-bp internal standard . 
 dna damage was assessed using single - cell gel electrophoresis assay ( scge ; comet assay ) . 
 the alkaline version of comet assay was performed according to the method described by singh et al . . 
 cells were embedded in 65  l 0.6% low - melting point agarose layer ( boehringer mannheim  germany ) ( dnase free  rnase free ) on agarose - coated frosted slides . 
 the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 2.5  m nacl  100  mm edta  10  mm tris  1% n - laurylsarcosine  1% triton  and 2% dimethylsulphoxide  at ph 10  for 1  h at 4c . 
 thereafter  the cells were exposed to a strong alkaline solution ( 300  mm naoh  1  mm edta  ph 13 ) for 25  min in an electrophoresis chamber . 
 electrophoresis was performed for 20  min at 25  v and 200  ma . 
 the slides were then neutralized ( 0.4  m tris  ph 7.5 ) and stained with ethidium bromide ( 20  g / ml ) . 
 comets were analysed by fluorescence microscopy ( carl zeiss  germany ) with visual inspection of tail length of nuclei . 
 the cell nuclei were classified into five categories : ( 0 ) undamaged ( nuclei without comet tail )  ( 1 ) low damaged ( nuclei with comet tails up to two fold longer than nucleus diameter )  ( 2 ) damaged ( nuclei with comet tail two to three - fold longer than nucleus diameter )  ( 3 ) highly damaged ( nuclei with comet tails three fold longer than nucleus diameter )  and ( 4 ) severely damaged ( cell nuclei was almost not visible with long and dispersed comet tails ) . 
 at least 300 cells per slide were counted  and two slides were prepared for each treatment . 
 a total damage score was determined by multiplying the number of cells assigned to each grade of damage by the numeric value of the grade according to methods describe by heaton et al . . 
 total dna damage score was calculated as follows : 
 ( 1)total  dna  damage=[(0n0)+(1n1)+(2n2 )  + ( 3n3)+(4n4 ) ]  
							 where n0 = cells with score 0  n1 = cells with score 1  n2 = cells with score 2  n3 = cells with score 3  and n4 = cells with score 4 . 
 untreated control and trf - treated hdfs were subcultured in 10  cm tissue culture dishes . after 24  h incubation 
  cells were harvested and prepared using cycletest plus dna reagent kit ( becton dickinson  usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instruction . 
 cell cycle status was analyzed by facs caliber flow cytometer ( becton dickinson  usa ) using propidium iodide ( pi ) as a specific fluorescent dye probe . 
 each experiment was carried out in triplicates with at least 3 independent cultures with comparable results . 
 comparison between groups were made by anova and student 's t - test ( two - tailed ) . 
 figure 1 shows the percentage of viable fibroblast cells after incubated with trf at various concentrations ( 0.10.5  mg / ml ) for 24  h. the percentage of viable cells was significantly increased ( p < .05 ) with trf treatment at 0.5  mg / ml ( figure 1(a ) ) for young hdfs . for presenescent hdfs  the percentage of viable cells was significantly increased ( p < .05 ) with trf incubation at concentrations of 0.3  mg / ml  0.4  mg / ml  and 0.5  mg / ml ( figure 1(b ) ) while the percentage of viable cells for senescent hdfs was significantly increased ( p < .05 ) with trf treatment at all concentrations ( figure 1(c ) ) . therefore  
 trf at concentration 0.5 g / ml was used for the subsequent experiments for all types of hdfs . 
 however  with senescence  the original fibroblastic shape was lost and hdfs became larger and flattened with accumulation of cytoplasmic granular inclusions ( figures 2(a)2(c ) ) . 
 the morphology of trf - treated hdfs resembled that of young cells with more spindle shaped cells present ( figures 2(d)2(f ) ) .   positive blue stain of sa--gal appeared mainly in hdfs at passage 30 suggesting the presence of senescent cells ( figure 3 ) . 
 quantitative analysis showed the percentage of cells positive for sa--gal staining was increased ( p < .05 ) in senescent cells compared to young and presenescent hdfs . 
 incubation of senescent cells with 0.5  mg / ml trf significantly decreased ( p < .05 ) the percentage of positive sa--gal stained cells compared to untreated control ( figure 4 ) .   damaged dna was higher in senescent hdfs compared to young and presenescent cells ( p < .05 ) which was decreased with trf - treatment ( p < 
 cell cycle progression analysis showed that the cell population in the s phase was lower ( p < .05 ) in senescent hdfs compared to young hdfs . 
 treatment with trf significantly increased ( p < .05 ) cells in the s phase and g2/m phase for all stages of cellular senescence of hdfs . 
 in contrast  cell populations in g0/g1 phase decreased significantly ( p < .05 ) with trf treatment in young  presenescent  and senescent hdfs ( figure 6 ) . 
 figure 7(a ) shows the representative southern blot analysis of hdfs at various passages with trf treatment . 
 telomere length in senescent hdfs was significantly decreased compared to untreated young hdfs ( p < .05 ) . 
 similar trf treatment had no effect on telomere length in young hdfs ( figure 7(b ) ) . 
 figure 7(c ) shows the representative pcr analysis for telomerase activity of hdfs at various passages with trf treatment . 
 treatment with trf significantly increased the telomerase activity in senescent hdfs ( p < .05 ) whereby no effects was observed in young hdfs ( figure 7(d ) ) . 
 the present study evaluated the effects   of tocotrienol - rich fraction ( trf ) in possibly modulating cellular ageing in hdfs . 
 our results showed that when   hdfs reached senescence  there were clear changes in cell morphology  decreased cell proliferation   and increased senescence associated -galactosidase activity . 
 typical morphology of senescent cells observed in this study   has also been reported with multiple passages of cells . 
 granular cytoplasmic and vacuoles accumulation are   common features of senescent cells accounting for the large cells . 
 senescent cells are also filled with large and numerous lysosomes that contain hydrolytic enzymes which function in ingesting and digesting organelles that are aged or damaged . 
 the increased sa--gal positive cells which was observed with senescence of hdfs can be attributed to increased in lysosomal content . 
 increased autophagy may be associated with an increase in lysosomal mass and sa--gal in in   vitro ageing . in addition  it is possible to find a correlation between the increase in sa--gal and appearance of the senescent morphotypes . 
 increase in sa--gal activity in senescent hdfs and stress - induced premature senescence ( sips ) is an irreversible process upon subculture  suggesting that cellular ageing results in irreversible nonmitotic growth . 
 however  incubation with trf was shown to decrease the percentage of cells positive for sa--gal suggesting a reversal of cellular ageing of hdfs . 
 this effect is possibly due to the antioxidant property of trf which consists of -tocopherols and all isomers of tocotrienols . 
 previous study has shown that tocotrienols have high antioxidant activity and that the uptake of tocotrienols from the culture medium by cultured cells was more efficient than tocopherols . 
 our data on cells viability study showed trf treatment increased the percentage of viable cells with increasing concentrations of trf . 
 the percentage of viable cells was highest at the maximum concentration studied  that is  0.5  mg / ml indicating trf promoted cells propagation and viability in all stages of cellular ageing of hdfs . 
 oxidative stress caused damage to dna which increased significantly in senescent cells  especially in postmitotic tissues and the levels correlated with ageing and age - related diseases . 
 reported that age - related increased in the levels of oxidative dna base damage was a significant contributor to many age - related pathological diseases . 
 if accumulation of damaged dna exceeds its elimination by dna repair mechanism  cellular senescence  or apoptosis takes place and contributes to the ageing process . 
 comparison of damaged dna in different treatment groups of hdfs in the present study showed that total dna damage was significantly increased in senescent cells while less damaged dna was observed in young and presenescent hdfs . 
 ros caused chronic and persistent damage to dna  causing double strand breaks that remain unrepaired which tend to accumulate in senescent cells indicating a possible cause of ageing in mammals . 
 increased in ros - induced dna damage was reported to be correlated with cell cycle arrest . 
 similarly  our data showed significant decreased in s phase cells and increased in damaged dna in senescent hdfs indicating less cell proliferation and greater dna damage as cells aged . 
 it is highly probable that protection against dna damage with trf treatment in senescent hdfs could be attributed to either prevention of oxidative stress - induced dna damage or enhancement of dna repair mechanism . 
 vitamin e  particularly -tocopherol  has been suggested to inhibit activation of endonuclease that can be triggered by intracellular oxidative stress and enhanced dna repair by increasing the rate of removal of damaged dna . 
 previous study reported that vitamin e reduced h2o2-induced ho generation and subsequent dna base pair modification in human oral epithelial cells   besides decreasing h2o2-induced dna strand breaks in human skin cell line vh10 . 
 cellular senescence in response to dna damage or degradation would make the cells 's progeny nonviable and might indicate a decline in renewal capability of cells as they reach an irreversible growth arrest . 
 our data showed no significant difference in g0/g1 or g2/m phase with cellular ageing of hdfs  while the s phase cells decreased significantly . 
 the reduction in s phase cells with senescence can be attributed to slow rate of proliferation as cells undergoing ageing . 
 the decreased and increased cells in g0/g1 phase and s phase  respectively  were observed with trf treatment at various stages of cellular ageing indicating inhibition of growth arrest and enhancement of cell replication . 
 this observation indicated trf was able to promote cell progression  and increased cells replicative capacity . decreased level of total dna damage and increased percentage of cells in s phase in trf - treated senescent cells indicated a potential protective role of trf against dna strand breaks and cell cycle arrest . 
 it has been clearly demonstrated that cell replication caused telomere shortening due to the inability of dna polymerase to completely replicate the 3-ends of lagging strands in the majority of normal human somatic cells which lack telomerase activity . 
 our data in the present study suggested that both telomere shortening and decreased telomerase activity might be the contributing factors in cellular ageing . 
 it has been reported that due to inherent limitations in the mechanics of dna replication  telomeres shorten at each cell division  and in the absence of telomerase  when telomere shortening reaches a critical limit  cells are susceptible to chromosomal aberrations such as end - to - end fusion and aneuploidy . in such a situation  
 treatment with trf  however  protected against telomere shortening in senescent hdfs with concomitant increased in telomerase activity . 
 our previous study had shown that both -tocotrienol and -tocopherol protected against oxidative stress - induced telomere shortening in hdfs derived from differently aged individuals . 
 the restoration of telomerase activity induced by -tocopherol caused significant increased in telomere length especially in skin fibroblast obtained from old donor [ 26  41 ] . in summary  
 trf treatment exerted better protection in senescent hdfs when compared to young and presenescent hdfs . 
 possibly higher requirement for antioxidants is indicated in senescent hdfs as the uptake of trf and its utilization in senescent hdfs is enhanced for protection against ros related damage . 
 therefore  we concluded that tocotrienol - rich fraction delays or prevents cellular ageing particularly in senescent hdfs as shown by the elongated telomere length  decreased levels of damaged dna  and progression of cell cycle to s phase besides increased cell propagation in all stages of cellular ageing of hdfs with trf treatment .",".

Abstract:
This study investigated the effects of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) on preventing cellular senescence in human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs). Results showed that TRF reversed the morphology of senescent HDFs, restored telomere length and telomerase activity, and reduced damaged DNA and cell cycle arrest associated with senescence.

Research and Discussion:
Primary cultures of HDFs were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml TRF for 24 hours, and the results showed a decrease in telomerase activity and telomere shortening in senescent HDFs. However, incubation with TRF reversed these effects and restored HDFs to a more youthful state, with decreased activity of SA-β-gal, reduced damaged DNA, and an increase in cells in the S phase of the cell cycle.

Results and Conclusion:
In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate the ability of TRF to prevent cellular aging in HDFs by restoring telomere length and telomerase activity, reducing damaged DNA, and reversing cell cycle arrest associated with senescence. These findings highlight the potential benefits of TRF as a therapeutic intervention for slowing the cellular aging process."
"young  healthy organisms strive to maintain their proteome in a functional state through the tight control of rates of protein synthesis  folding  and degradation . 
 extensive quality - control systems are set up throughout the cell to prevent and manage protein damage . 
 as the organism ages  these control mechanisms become less efficient  leading to a disruption in protein homeostasis ( balch et  al .  2008  david  2012 ) . 
 aging is the main risk factor for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases where specific proteins accumulate as pathological aggregates . 
 recently  there has been considerable interest in investigating widespread protein aggregation in the absence of disease . 
 multiple studies have demonstrated that several hundred proteins become highly detergent - insoluble in aged animals ( ayyadevara et  al .  2016  david  2012  david et  al .  2010  demontis and perrimon  2010  reis - rodrigues et  al .  2012  
  2016  walther et  al .  2015 ) . computational analysis of the insoluble proteome indicates an overrepresentation of proteins with functional and structural similarities ( david et  al .  2010 ) . 
 the examination of some of these proteins in  vivo reveals their assembly into large 
 the discovery of endogenous age - dependent protein aggregation in model organisms gives us the unprecedented opportunity to dissect the intrinsic cellular machineries responsible for preventing protein aggregation without using ectopically expressed human disease - associated proteins . at this time  very little is known concerning the regulation of widespread protein insolubility with age and its consequences for the health of the organism . 
 interestingly  several studies show that protein insolubility is modified in long - lived animals with reduced insulin / insulin growth factor ( igf)-1 daf-2 signaling  but it remains unclear to which extent ( david et  al . 
  2010  demontis and perrimon  2010  walther et  al .  2015 ) . 
 a growing number of familial and sporadic forms of neurodegenerative diseases show pathological inclusions caused by  abnormal aggregation of rna - binding proteins ( rbps ) . 
 the first rbps identified in these inclusions were tar dna binding protein of 43  kda ( tdp-43 ) and fused in sarcoma ( fus )  associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( ftld ) ( arai et  al .  2006  neumann et  al .  2009  neumann et  al .  2006 ) . since then additional rbps such  as taf15  ewsr1  hnrnpa2b1  hnrnpa1  and hnrnpa3 
 all of the known rbps associated with dementia contain a low - complexity ( lc )  prion - like  domain enriched in glycines and uncharged polar amino acids  and similar to the sequences driving yeast prion aggregation ( alberti et  al . 
 lc prion - like domains are also present in key rbps that mediate the assembly of rna granules by liquid - liquid phase separation ( lin et  al .  2015  
 significantly  a small proportion of liquid droplets made by rbps transform into solid aggregates over time in  vitro ( lin et  al .  2015  
  2015  murakami et  al .  2015  patel et  al .  2015 ) . for clarity 
  we will use the term aggregation only when referring to the formation of non - dynamic rbp aggregates . 
 an important question is whether the special assembly properties of rbps puts them at risk of aggregating during aging in a multicellular organism and not just in the context of disease . 
 interestingly  several rbps with lc prion - like domains were identified in the insoluble proteome of aged animals ( david et  al .  2010 ) . 
 overall  it is imperative to know the causes and consequences of wild - type rbp aggregation during aging in order to fully understand rbp aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases . 
 furthermore  it is likely that the organism has evolved specific mechanisms to control liquid droplet protein aggregation . in the current study  we chose to focus on key rbps responsible for stress granule formation . 
 stress granules are a specific type of rna granule that protect the cell by sequestering mrna from the translational machinery during periods of stress . 
 importantly  stress granule proteins are often found to co - localize with pathological inclusions of tdp-43 and fus ( bentmann et  al . 
 whether these stress granule proteins are innocent bystanders transiently interacting with tdp-43 and fus or whether they co - aggregate and accelerate disease - associated rbp aggregation remains intensely debated ( bentmann et  al .  2013  li et  al .  2013 ) . 
 we show that key stress - granule - related rbps ( sgrbps ) accumulate in aberrant stress granule - like puncta and in large solid aggregates in aged c.  elegans . 
 proteomic analysis revealed that long - lived animals with reduced daf-2 signaling preferentially abrogate the insolubility of rna granule components . 
 importantly  sgrbp aggregates are associated with reduced animal size  motility  and lifespan . 
 we show that sgrbp aggregation is triggered at an earlier age by their co - aggregation with other misfolded proteins  a process that is prevented by daf-16 in daf-2 mutants . 
 in addition  the proteostasis network established by heat shock transcription factor 1 ( hsf-1 ) during development is required to maintain dynamic stress granule proteins throughout the animal s life . 
 to identify and quantify changes in aggregation - prone proteins in animals with reduced daf-2 signaling  we performed an in - depth proteomic analysis of the insoluble proteome from both control and long - lived animals ( figure  1a ; table s1 ) . because protein misfolding and aggregation is highly abundant in aged c.  elegans gonads and masks changes in other somatic tissues ( david et  al . 
  2010  goudeau and aguilaniu  2010  zimmerman et  al .  2015 )  we used a gonad - less mutant to focus our analysis on protein insolubility in non - reproductive tissues . 
 we isolated large aggregates that are pelleted by low centrifugal forces ( 20000   g ) and insoluble in 0.5% sds . 
 in three biological replicates  we identified 260 insoluble proteins  of which 186 were highly prone to aggregate with age in control animals ( figure  1b ) . 
 the strong correlations between the control replicates ( r  = 0.77  r  = 0.85  and r  = 0.67 ) and long - lived replicates ( r  = 0.87  r  = 0.86 . and 
 r  = 0.82 ) attest to the quality of the quantification and experimental reproducibility ( figures s1a and s1b ) . 
 none of these insoluble proteins was more prone to aggregate with age in the long - lived animals as compared with controls . 
 these results are consistent with previous observations ( david et  al .  2010  demontis and perrimon  2010 ) . 
 surprisingly  a recent proteomic study showed that endogenous protein insolubility is higher in daf-2 mutants than in wild - type animals ( walther et  al .  2015 ) . 
 to account for procedural differences  we performed the extraction following the less stringent extraction protocol from walther et  al . 
 ( 2015 ) . by omitting sds and using ultracentrifugation at 500000   g  walther et  al . analyzed highly insoluble large aggregates ( as in this study )  as well as smaller and more soluble aggregates . 
 however  we did not observe a general change in the action of daf-2 signaling on protein insolubility with age after using the less stringent extraction protocol ( figure  s1c ) . 
 next  we asked whether the inconsistencies between the studies could be related to protein aggregation in the gonad and indeed  we found that long - lived animals with gonads have proportionally more insoluble proteins compared with wild - type animals with gonads ( figure  s1d ) . 
 these results suggest that aggregation in the gonad masks the protective effect of reduced daf-2 signaling in somatic tissues . 
 importantly  we confirmed this protective action of reduced daf-2 signaling with several candidates ( see below ) . taken together  these data demonstrate that reduced daf-2 signaling promotes protein solubility in most tissues with age . to investigate specifically changes in insolubility regulated by reduced daf-2 signaling  we sorted proteins prone to aggregate with age in control animals ( > 2-fold ) by their fold change in insolubility with age in the long - lived conditions . 
 we restricted our analysis to 87 proteins that aggregated less with age ( < 0.83-fold ) and 52 proteins that continued to aggregate with age ( > 1.2-fold ) in the long - lived animals ( figure  1b ; table s1 ) . 
 previous bioinformatics analysis of aggregation - prone proteins revealed an enrichment in both -sheet propensity and aliphatic amino acids ( david et  al .  2010 ) . 
 a similar enrichment in the whole insoluble proteome was identified in this study ( figures s1e and s1f ) . 
 intriguingly  when examining the two groups of insoluble proteins that were differentially regulated by reduced daf-2 signaling  we found a segregation of the two properties . 
 proteins with abrogated aggregation with the daf-2 rnai treatment were highly enriched in aliphatic amino acids  in particular alanine  glycine  and valines  but not in  sheets ( figures 1c  1d  and s1 g ) . 
 conversely  proteins that still aggregate in the daf-2( ) condition had a significant propensity to form  sheets but were only modestly enriched in aliphatic amino acids ( figures 1c and 1d ) . 
 next  we searched for functional differences between the two  groups differentially regulated by reduced daf-2 signaling . 
 strikingly  ribosomal proteins and rna granule components  including stress granule and p - granule rbps  were highly overrepresented among the proteins that were prevented from aggregating with age in the long - lived animals ( tables s2a and s3 ) . 
 conversely  chaperones and vitellogenin yolk proteins were overrepresented among proteins that were still prone to aggregate with age in daf-2( ) conditions ( table s2b ) . among the rbps  four 
 are predicted to have lc prion - like domains ( alberti et  al .  2009 ) : 
 pab-1  fib-1  hrp-1  and car-1 ( figure  s2a ) . by western blot 
  we confirmed that reduced daf-2 signaling abrogated their aggregation with age ( figures 1e and  s2b ) . 
 in addition  we evaluated two proteins without rna - binding or lc prion - like domains  par-5 and daf-21  quantified by mass spectrometry as more insoluble with age in both control  and long - lived animals . 
 we confirmed that par-5 and daf-21 continued to aggregate with age in long - lived animals ( by > 7-fold and 10-fold  respectively )  albeit to a reduced extent compared with controls ( figure  s2c ) . of note 
  changes in aggregation were not correlated with changes in total protein levels ( figure  s3 ) . 
 a previous study found that the chemical b - isox exclusively causes rna granules to precipitate out from whole - cell lysates by inducing their assembly into a hydrogel ( han et  al . 
 proteins precipitated by b - isox were also enriched in aliphatic amino acids ( in particular glycine and to a lesser extent alanine and valine ) and not in the propensity to form  sheets ( figures 1c  1d  and s1 g ) . 
 we checked for proteins in common with our study and found a very significant overlap between proteins precipitated by b - isox and proteins no longer aggregating in the long - lived conditions ( figure  1f ; table s4 ) . 
 together  these results indicate that different types of rna granule components including key rbps responsible for their assembly become insoluble with age  and long - lived animals with reduced daf-2 signaling are highly successful in preventing their aggregation . 
 interestingly  higher levels of aliphatic amino acids in rna granule components could help their assembly and/or drive their age - dependent aggregation . 
 to investigate further the aggregation of key rbps with lc prion - like domains and to understand the mechanisms involved  we generated c.  elegans strains expressing pab-1 and tiar-2 in the pharyngeal muscles  fused to fluorescent tags . 
 pab-1 and tiar-2 are the c.  elegans homologs of human polyadenylate - binding protein 1 ( pabp-1 ) and t - cell - restricted intracellular antigen-1 ( tia-1 )  two prominent rbps that localize to stress granules and are also minor components of pathological inclusions that occur in als and fltd ( bentmann et  al .  2012 ) . 
 both of these rbps harbor lc prion - like domains ( figure  s2a ) ( alberti et  al .  2009 ) . 
 exposing cells to stressors such as heat induces rbps with lc prion - like domains to form liquid droplets ( molliex et  al .  2015  patel et  al .  2015 ) . 
 similarly  heat shock in c.  elegans caused pab-1 and tiar-2 to form stress granules ( figures 2a and 2c ; figure  s4a ) ( murakami et  al . 
  2012  rousakis et  al .  2014 ) . when co - expressed  pab-1 and tiar-2 localized to the same stress granules ( figure  s4b ) . 
 consistent with the dynamic nature of stress granules  these puncta were no longer observed 24  hr after the heat shock ( figures 2a and 2c ) . using antibodies 
  we observed a similar change in pattern with endogenous pab-1  indicating the effect is not merely due to overexpression or the fluorescent tag ( figure  s4c ) . 
 as an additional control  we showed that kinase kin-19  which is not an rbp and lacks a lc prion - like domain  does not localize to stress granules upon heat shock ( figure  s4d ) . with age 
  we observed a striking change in the distribution pattern of these key stress granule rbps . whereas the majority of pab-1 and tiar-2 proteins were diffusely localized in non - stressed young animals  we found that both stress granule components accumulated in distinct puncta in aged animals ( figures 2b and 2d ; figure  s4f ) 
 this change was specific for pab-1 and tiar-2 as the fluorescent tags alone ( venus or tagrfp ) remained diffuse with age ( figure  s4e ) ( david et  al .  2010 ) . 
 the results were not simply caused by overexpression because endogenous pab-1 formed similar puncta with age  in the different head regions where it is natively expressed ( figure  s4 g ) . 
 for both pab-1 and tiar-2  we observed a significant increase with age in the number of worms with large puncta that are visible by low - magnification microscopy ( figures 2e and 2f ; figure  s4h ) . 
 interestingly  imaging at high magnification revealed that tiar-2 in aged animals was localized predominantly in small puncta highly reminiscent of stress granules assembled during heat shock  whereas pab-1 accumulated to a greater extent in large puncta that were not normally observed upon heat shock in young animals ( figures 2b  2d  single - plane insets  3a  3c  and 3d ) . 
 quantification confirmed that stress granules induced during heat shock and aberrant tiar-2 stress granule - like puncta formed during aging had similar sizes ( figure  3b ) . 
 remarkably  when co - expressed  pab-1 preferentially co - localized within tiar-2-positive age - dependent stress - granule - like puncta ( figure  2 g )  suggesting that interactions between rbps change their aggregation patterns . a hallmark of protein aggregation associated with disease is the immobility of proteins within the aggregates . 
 to evaluate this aspect  we monitored fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( frap ) in large pab-1 and tiar-2 puncta ( figures 3e3i ) . 
 all large tiar-2 puncta and half of the large pab-1 puncta in aged animals showed no fluorescence recovery  demonstrating that these are solid aggregates ( figures 3e3i ) . 
 because of the small size of the age - dependent stress - granule - like puncta  it was not possible to assess the mobility of tiar-2 or pab-1 in these structures . 
 consequently  we used the large puncta as a readout for sgrbp aggregation in subsequent experiments . 
 the consequences of age - dependent protein aggregation for the animal s health are poorly understood . 
 here  we evaluated the impact of the aggregation of a key stress granule component during aging . surprisingly  pab-1 overexpression was protective as animals  grown at 15c  20c  or 25c all their life  lived longer than non - transgenic animals ( table s5 ) . 
 however  this effect is likely due to higher levels of functional pab-1 and not related to protein aggregation because pab-1 does not aggregate in animals at 15c ( figure  s5a ) . in order to distinguish effects specifically related to pab-1 aggregation  we separated pab-1 transgenics at day 7 into three groups depending on their aggregation levels . 
 we found that animals with pab-1 aggregation were significantly smaller in size compared with animals without pab-1 aggregation ( figure  4a ; figure  s5b ) . 
 in addition  smaller animals were visibly less motile ( movie s1 ) . importantly  
 mildly stressed animals with the highest levels of aggregation died earlier ( figure  4b ; table s5 ) . 
 our proteomic study revealed that reduced daf-2 signaling efficiently prevents the insolubility of stress granule components with age . 
 we confirmed that long - lived daf-2 mutants greatly delay the formation of both stress - granule - like structures and large aggregates of pab-1 and tiar-2 ( figures 5a and 5b ; figures s6a and s6b ) . 
 to gain insight into the mechanisms controlling protein aggregation  we investigated the role of the transcription factor hsf-1 activated by reduced daf-2 signaling ( hsu et  al .  2003  
 hsp40 modulate stress granule dynamics in saccharomyces cerevisiae and/or in cell culture ( cherkasov et  al . 
 because chaperone expression is controlled by hsf-1 in c.  elegans  we speculated that hsf-1 may regulate sgrbp aggregation . 
 indeed  impairing hsf-1 activity in both daf-2( ) and wild - type backgrounds caused severe pab-1 aggregation already in young adults as well as in aged individuals  an effect that was reversed by overexpressing hsf-1 ( figures 5c5e ; figures s6c and s6d ) . 
 interestingly  hsf-1 in daf-2 mutants did not control the aggregation of the kinase kin-19  which was previously shown to misfold and form solid aggregates with age ( figure  5 g ) ( david et  al .  2010 ) . 
 these results suggest that hsf-1 regulates different types of endogenous protein aggregation with age to different extents . 
 it was previously shown that to assure daf-2( ) longevity  hsf-1 is most highly expressed and acts mainly during development ( volovik et  al .  2012 ) . 
 we observed that impairing hsf-1 activity by rnai during adulthood had no effect on pab-1 aggregation ( figure  5f ; figure  s6e ) . 
 conversely  reducing hsf-1 activity by rnai during development caused pab-1 aggregation in young adults  albeit mainly in the anterior bulb ( figure  5f ) . 
 the same chaperones discovered to regulate stress granule dynamics in other model systems could also play a role in preventing sgrbp aggregation . in yeast the hsp40 proteins sis1 and ydj1 were shown to co - localize with stress granules and to play a role in stress granule disassembly ( walters et  al .  2015 ) . 
 we evaluated worm strains overexpressing yellow fluorescent protein ( yfp)-tagged dnj-13 and dnj-19  the worm orthologs of sis1 and ydj1  together with tagrfp::pab-1 . 
 we observed occasional co - localization of both chaperones with both heat - induced pab-1 stress granules and age - dependent large and stress - granule - like pab-1 puncta ( figures s6 g and s6h ) . 
 these findings were confirmed in single tagrfp::pab-1 transgenics using antibodies against dnj-13 and dnj-19 ( data not shown ) . 
 however  overexpression of dnj-19 and dnj-13 did not significantly reduce pab-1 aggregation with age ( figures s6f and s6i )  indicating that these chaperones may not modulate sgrbp aggregation . 
 however  we observed no co - staining with either pab-1 stress granules induced by heat shock or pab-1 puncta formed during aging . 
 therefore  it is possible that hsp110 does not modulate stress granule dynamics and sgrbp aggregation in c.  elegans . finally  we investigated the role of hsp70 on sgrbp aggregation and found that inhibition of hsp70 by rnai did not alter pab-1 aggregation ( table s6 ) . of note  the later results could be caused by redundancy between chaperone functions . 
 collectively  these results reveal that hsf-1 is an important regulator of sgrbp aggregation throughout life  and it contributes to maintaining dynamic stress granule proteins in long - lived daf-2 mutants . 
 next  we examined the role of the transcription factor daf-16 activated by reduced daf-2 signaling ( lin et  al . 
 1997 ) . in daf-2 mutants  daf-16 protected against pab-1 aggregation in aged animals ( figures 5c and 5d ) 
 importantly  daf-2 mutants use daf-16 to control different types of age - dependent protein aggregation because delayed aggregation of the kinase kin-19 was also dependent on daf-16 ( figure  5 g ) . 
 recent work performed in s.  cerevisiae and drosophila reveals that stress granules dynamically interact with misfolded proteins ( cherkasov et  al .  2013  kroschwald et  al .  2015 ) . 
 we speculated that widespread protein misfolding and aggregation occurring with age could promote sgrbp aggregation . in support of this hypothesis 
  we observed the co - localization of pab-1 and kin-19 in large immobile aggregates in double transgenics ( figures 6a and 6b ) . 
 next  we evaluated the rate of pab-1 and kin-19 aggregation in the double transgenics relative to their aggregation rates in single transgenics ( figures 6c and 6d ) . in the single transgenics  
 importantly  when both pab-1 and kin-19 were co - expressed  the presence of misfolded kin-19 triggered more abundant pab-1 aggregation at an earlier age ( figure  6c ) . 
 conversely  kin-19 aggregation was slightly impeded by pab-1 overexpression ( figure  6d )  indicating that sgrbp aggregation does not cross - seed kin-19 aggregation . 
 notably  pab-1 aggregation was not accelerated by the co - expression of a fluorescent tag alone ( figure  6e ) . 
 furthermore  we did not observe a general induction of pab-1 stress granules in young double - transgenic animals expressing both kin-19 and pab-1 ( figure  s6j ) . 
 these data strongly suggest that pab-1 aggregation is not simply the consequence of generalized cellular stress induced by kin-19 overexpression . 
 rather  the co - localization of kin-19 and pab-1 in the same aggregates as well as the earlier and accelerated aggregation of pab-1 is consistent with a seeding mechanism related to kin-19 aggregation . taken together  we interpret these findings to imply that the accumulation of misfolded proteins with age acts as a seed for sgrbp aggregation . therefore  the overall reduction in widespread protein aggregation in long - lived daf-2( ) conditions as evidenced by our proteomic analysis  at least in part through increased daf-16 activity  could be an effective strategy to prevent sgrbp aggregation . 
 several experimental manipulations have been shown to extend the lifespan of c.  elegans and protect against proteotoxicity ( kenyon  2010  taylor and dillin  2011 ) . 
 we found that both dietary restriction mimicked in eat-2 mutant animals as well as inhibition of mitochondrial function achieved by targeting cyc-1 with rnai strongly limited pab-1 aggregation with age ( figures 7a and 7b ) . 
 we show that a wide variety of rna granule components become highly insoluble with age in c.  elegans . together with previous in  vitro and cell culture results  
 our findings demonstrate that the capacity of rbps to cycle between assembled and disassembled states can become a liability in aging organisms . already in young animals  maintaining sgrbp dynamics necessitates an active control system established by hsf-1 . 
 the accumulation of other misfolded proteins during age acts as a seed for the aggregation of key sgrbps . 
 significantly  one of the main outcomes of the longevity program initiated by reduced daf-2 signaling while responding to widespread protein aggregation is the preservation of rbp solubility with age . in this study  we have examined in detail the aggregation pattern of pab-1 and tiar-2  two key rbps with lc prion - like domains that are important for the formation of stress granules . during the aging process  both proteins spontaneously assembled into small puncta similar to liquid droplets induced during stress and into larger aggregates . 
 significantly  upon co - expression  both pab-1 and tiar-2 co - localized in these age - related stress - granule - like structures . because our proteomic analysis revealed a number of stress granule components in the insoluble proteome  it is likely that secondary stress granule proteins are also incorporated . 
 therefore  an attractive hypothesis is that these small puncta represent stress granules formed as a response to stress related to aging . 
 the inherent aggregation propensity of sgrbps would induce at least some of these droplets to undergo the irreversible transition into a solid state . these stabilized stress granules 
 could then grow into large aggregates as we observed with pab-1  or simply accumulate with age as seen with tiar-2 . 
 an important question remains how the inherent propensity of rna granule components to aggregate with age could influence pathogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases . 
 one possibility is that inherent rbp aggregation impacts cellular health and thereby indirectly accelerates pathology . 
 we observed reduced lifespan and a striking decrease in size and mobility of animals with higher levels of pab-1 aggregation . 
 as yet  it remains unclear whether reduced fitness is a cause or consequence of pab-1 aggregation . in support of a gain of function related to sgrbp aggregation  
 two rare diseases are caused by mutated pabpn1 and tia-1  the human homologs of pab-1 and tiar-2  which accumulate in pathological aggregates ( brais et  al . 
 our proteomic analysis of aging c.  elegans highlighted three other rbps with lc prion - like domains that are highly prone to aggregate with age : hrp-1  fib-1  and car-1 . 
 the aggregation of the human homologs of hrp-1  hnrnp - a1  and hnrnp - a3 was recently discovered to cause multisystem proteinopathy and als / ftld ( kim et  al . 
 indeed  a loss in nucleolar protein fib-1 function caused by its aggregation with age could impair ribosomal biogenesis ( tollervey et  al . 
 the mammalian lsm14b and lsm14a homologs of car-1 localize to p bodies ( eulalio et  al .  2007 )  and aggregation of key p - body components could impair non - sense - mediated decay . therefore  it will be important to investigate the consequences of fib-1 and car-1 aggregation on cellular health . apart from accelerating pathology indirectly by reducing cellular health  
 the presence of stress granule proteins in pathological protein aggregates is emerging as a common denominator in different types of neurodegenerative diseases including als  ftld  alzheimer s disease  and huntington s disease ( aulas and vande velde  2015  bentmann et  al . 
 the inherent aggregation propensity of stress granule proteins demonstrates that they are unlikely to be transient interacting partners in pathological aggregates . 
 it remains to be determined whether age - related sgrbp aggregation acts as a seed for disease - associated protein aggregation . 
 overall  the role of stress granules in neurodegenerative diseases is clearly highly complex because there is evidence supporting the recruitment of disease - associated proteins to stress granules and vice versa . 
 interestingly  recent cell culture data show that the assembly of stress granules caused by disease - associated protein aggregation in turn promotes pathological aggregation ( vanderweyde et  al .  2016 ) . 
 the age - dependent aggregation of sgrbps and prevalence of stress granule components in neurodegenerative diseases underline their relevance as therapeutic targets . 
 one successful strategy would be to prevent the initial assembly of stress granules ( kim et  al .  2014 ) . 
  it will be important to understand how longevity pathways relying on dietary restriction or defective mitochondrial respiration efficiently prevent sgrbp aggregation . in the case of reduced daf-2 signaling  sgrbp aggregation is suppressed by at least two mechanisms : daf-16 activation prevents cross - seeding by delaying the accumulation of misfolded aggregation - prone proteins  and increased activity of hsf-1 during development assures enhanced sgrbp proteostasis throughout adulthood . 
 to date  cross - seeding of rbp aggregation has been observed only with the huntingtin protein containing an expanded polyglutamine repeat region ( furukawa et  al .  2009 ) . 
 it will be important to investigate by which means endogenous aggregation - prone proteins lacking motifs similar to the lc prion - like domain would cross - seed rbps aggregation . 
 overall  both of these strategies used to restore the dynamic nature of stress granule proteins could also directly prevent disease - associated rbp aggregation .

Abstract: Key RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) mediate the reversible assembly of RNA granules. Individual RBPs have been linked to specific neurodegenerative diseases, but the impact of aging on RBP dynamics remains unknown. This study shows that aging leads to insoluble RBP aggregates in C. elegans, and inhibition of insulin signaling can prevent this aggregation with beneficial effects on fitness.

Research and Discussion: The study reveals that aging results in insoluble RBP aggregates and reduced fitness in C. elegans. Further investigation shows that reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling can prevent RBP aggregation. Additionally, heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF-1) is found to regulate stress-granule-related RBP aggregation in both young and aged animals.

Results and Conclusion: The study demonstrates that aging disturbs RBP dynamics and leads to insoluble RBP aggregates, which are associated with reduced fitness. However, manipulating insulin/IGF-1 signaling and HSF-1 activity can prevent RBP aggregation and maintain dynamic RBPs during aging. These mechanisms could potentially be relevant for neurodegenerative diseases and promoting longevity."

 hearing loss is a significant public health concern given the deleterious effects that untreated hearing impairment may have on overall physical and cognitive wellbeing.1  2 the hearing health foundation reports that nearly 50 million americans have hearing loss.3 sensorineural hearing losses generally have a highfrequency component . 
 this frequency region is essential for good speech understanding in complex listening environments  particularly in noise.4  5 individuals with substantial  bilateral highfrequency hearing loss experience hearing difficulties in most aspects of life : at home  on the phone  at work  and in social situations 
 . they can be highly frustrated because existing hearing aid technology can not overcome the problems of reduced word understanding in quiet and noise.6  7  8 due to their communication problems  they may become isolated  withdrawing from family  colleagues  and friends . with severe hearing loss  areas of minimal or nonfunctioning hair cells or auditory 
 neurons are often present  resulting in cochlear dead regions where vibrations of the basilar membrane are not detected via inner hair cells or neurons in that region . 
 frequencies falling in a dead region are detected via apical or basal spread of vibrations to other cochlear places . 
 therefore  hearing loss at a given frequency may be greater than indicated by the audiometric threshold.9 typically  acoustic amplification of dead regions does not improve speech understanding and may worsen it.10  11 individuals with this hearing loss profile may be candidates for electric plus acoustic stimulation in the same ear . 
 treatment options for individuals with bilateral  severe skislope hearing loss have been limited to stateofthe art amplification  including frequency lowering12 in an effort to improve speech intelligibility . 
 these attempts often end with the rejection of hearing aids due to the lack of benefit  leaving the individual with no other alternatives . 
 studies have shown that an implant with a shorter electrode array provides beneficial electric stimulation for high frequencies while preserving acoustic lowfrequency hearing  resulting in improved speech understanding.13  14 recently  lenarz et al . described results from a european multicenter study using the cochlear ltd . 
  sydney  australia  nucleus hybrid l24 implant.15 we report results of the clinical trial leading to u.s . food and drug administration approval of the firstofitskind combined electric and acoustic ( hybrid ) implant system to address the substantial hearing difficulties of individuals not benefitting from amplification and not eligible for a standard cochlear implant ( ci ) . 
 this was a prospective  singlearm  multicenter trial to determine the safety and effectiveness of the hybrid system . 
 subjects were implanted at 10 clinical sites in the united states and served as their own controls in all test conditions . 
 the protocol was approved by the us food and drug administration and relevant institutional review boards  and all participants gave written informed consent . 
 the ear selected for implantation had severe (  75 db hl averaged over 2000  3000  4000 hz ) highfrequency sensorineural hearing loss and relatively good lowfrequency hearing (  60 db hl at 125  250  and 500 hz ) . 
 in addition  an aided consonantnucleusconsonant ( cnc ) monosyllabic word score of 10% through 60% using an appropriately fit hearing aid was required . 
 aided word recognition in the contralateral ear was required to be similar or better than the ear to be treated  but not better than 80% . 
 those with durations of severe or profound hearing loss greater than 30 years and/or onset of hearing loss less than 2 years were excluded . 
 the protocol included acoustic thresholds measured for each ear preoperatively and postoperatively  at device activation  and 3  6  and 12 months postactivation . 
 consonantnucleusconsonant words were presented at 60 dba ; azbio sentences in noise were presented at 60 dba in 10talker babble noise at + 5 db signaltonoise ratio . to evaluate effectiveness of the hybrid system as used routinely  
 speech perception outcomes were analyzed in the everyday listening condition  which is listening through the hybrid system in combination with acoustic hearing in the opposite  unimplanted ear . to gain insight into 
 how hearing impacts quality of life  the validated speech  spatial  and qualities of hearing questionnaire ( ssq)16 was administered as a selfassessment of hearing within three domains : hearing speech in various environments  spatial hearing  and sound qualities . 
 a device use questionnaire was administered that addressed overall satisfaction with the hybrid system relative to hearing aids . 
 surgery for the hybrid l24 implant ( cochlear ) is a modification of that for standard cis  similar to the description by gantz et al.13 ; details are provided in the nucleus hybrid l24 implant surgeon 's guide ( cochlear).17 after the postauricular incision  the surgeon creates a well bed on the skull posterior to the mastoid and opens the facial recess ( posterior tympanotomy ) widely to provide good visibility of the round window niche in the middle ear . 
 although the hybrid implant electrode may be inserted through the round window or cochleostomy  in this trial all electrodes were inserted through a small cochleostomy created just inferior to the round window . after performing the cochleostomy 
  the surgeon opens the endosteum of the cochlea with a pick just prior to inserting the electrode array . 
 the array is slowly inserted 16 mm into the scala tympani instead of the 19 to 24 mm that are more typical for standard cis . 
 the 16mm straight electrode is very thin and has 22 halfband modiolarfacing electrode contacts to stimulate the basal region of the cochlea  with the intent to maintain apical cochlear structures responsible for lowfrequency hearing . 
 coprimary efficacy hypotheses were that outcomes on cnc words ( 100 recorded words administered)18 and azbio sentences in noise ( 40 recorded sentences administered)19 presented through the hybrid implant system ( cochlear ) would be significantly better at 6 months postimplantation than preoperative performance using a hearing aid . 
 the sample size of 50 subjects exceeded the minimum requirement for 90% statistical power  ensuring adequate power . 
 mean differences for subjects on the cnc word and azbio sentence recognition scores preoperatively and at the 6month endpoint were analyzed using paired t tests . 
 if there was evidence that assumptions did not hold  a wilcoxon signed rank test was used . 
 secondary efficacy objectives compared individual preoperative performance with a hearing aid to performance at the 6month endpoint on cnc words and phonemes and azbio sentences . 
 although no formal hypothesis test was conducted for these endpoints  success would be achieved if over 75% of subjects showed equal or better performance from preoperative to postoperative scores using the binomial model.20 
  the primary safety objective was to describe the safety of implantation with the hybrid system . 
 the primary safety endpoint was defined as any surgical and/or devicerelated event  reported as the number and proportion of individuals experiencing an adverse event .

 table 3 presents secondary objective outcomes based on binomial comparisons of preoperative to postoperative changes for cnc words and azbio sentences for the implanted ear at the 6month endpoint . 
 the secondary endpoint objectives were met : over 75% of the subjects demonstrated equal or improved performance on cnc words  phonemes  and azbio sentences with the hybrid implant relative to performance with a hearing aid . specifically  96% and 92% of subjects performed equal or better on cnc words and phonemes  respectively  and 90% on azbio sentences . furthermore  
 82% and 86% showed improved performance on cnc words and phonemes  respectively  and 74% improved on sentences . 
 the consistency of the primary endpoints for the treated ear was examined across subject subgroups defined by baseline characteristics : gender  age  duration of hearing loss  duration of severetoprofound highfrequency hearing loss  etiology  and baseline speech perception scores . 
 results indicated that baseline characteristics gender  age  and duration of hearing loss were the main factors in terms of speech perception outcomes . 
 this was not the case for duration of severetoprofound highfrequency hearing loss  etiology  and baseline speech scores . 
 mean benefit scores ( i.e.  improvement ) for females were significantly greater than males for cnc words ( females : 48.8% ; males : 25.7% ) and azbio tests ( females : 42.6% ; males : 23.5% ) ( p  =  0.002 and 0.02  respectively .

 the mean benefit for subjects below the median hearing loss duration of 23.5 years was significantly better ( p  =  0.01 ) than for hearing loss durations above 23.5 years for cncs ( <  23.5 years : 46.2% ; >  23.5 years : 27.5% ) but not azbio sentences ( <  23.5 years : 40.7% ; >  23.5 years : 24.7% ) ( p  =  0.05 )  although the trend favored shorter durations . 
 mean differences for cnc words and azbio sentences in noise at 6months postactivation  using the implant and contralateral hearing aid  were preoperatively compared to bilateral amplification . 
 for cncs  subjects ( n  =  49 ) showed significant ( p  <  0.001 ) improvement of 34.7 percentage points ( sd  =  17.4 ) compared to bilateral amplification . 
 for azbio sentences  subjects ( n  =  49 ) showed significant ( p  <  0.001 ) improvement of 33.0 percentage points ( sd  =  23.5 ) compared to bilateral amplification . 
 no subject showed a significant decrement preoperatively to postoperatively on either measure . at the 6month endpoint  all subjects performed equal or better than preoperatively with bilateral amplification with hearing aids . 
 fortyeight subjects completed the ssq preoperatively using hearing aids and after 6 months using the hybrid system in the everyday listening condition . for the speech hearing scale  subjects improved significantly ( p  <  0.001 )  showing a mean change score of 2.2 ( sd  =  1.8 ) . on the spatial hearing scale  there was a significant ( p  < 
 0.003 ) mean change score of .9 ( sd  =  2.0 ) ; on the sound quality scale  subjects experienced significantly ( p  <  0.001 ) improved mean change of 1.3 ( sd  =  2.0 ) .

 unlike prior ci trials  this was the first to quantify changes in residual hearing ; any changes in preoperative to postoperative hearing sensitivity were measured throughout the study period . 
 changes resulting in profound ( > 90 db hl ) hearing loss were reported as anticipated adverse events . at 6months postactivation  66% of subjects ( 33 of 50 ) retained functional acoustic sensitivity determined by a 5frequency pure tone average ( 125  250  500  750  1000 hz ) of a severe degree or better (  90 db hl ) .

 subjects with aidable  residual hearing performed better that those without aidable  residual hearing . however  even if subjects had no residual  aidable hearing  they performed better in the ci electriconly condition than preoperatively with hearing aids . regarding 17 subjects who did not maintain functional acoustic hearing  five chose to have the hybrid implant explanted and replaced with a standard ci .

 results from this study support the conclusion that the nucleus hybrid system ( cochlear ) delivers significantly improved speech understanding in quiet and noise compared to a hearing aid for individuals with bilateral  severe highfrequency hearing loss 
 . ninety percent of subjects achieved the same or better performance on both speech perception measures when listening with the hybrid system . 
 when using both ears  all subjects performed equal or better than preoperatively on both measures . 
 the ssq selfassessment supported speech intelligibility results  with significant improvement on all scales and with greatest improvement on the hearing speech scale . on overall listening satisfaction  
 the number of individuals satisfied increased from 8% preoperatively with amplification to 79% with the hybrid system . 
 this system delivers important highfrequency information through electrical stimulation and the opportunity to combine it with beneficial lowfrequency residual hearing in one or both ears . 
 outcomes for five subjects undergoing revision surgery suggest that a standard ci remains a viable treatment when hybrid implantation does not meet expectations . 
 current hearing aid technology often can not provide audible  clear highfrequency sound for individuals with this type of hearing loss . 
 individuals with substantial highfrequency losses frequently have nonfunctional inner and outer hair cells ; therefore  amplification can not be effective . 
 individuals with precipitously sloping losses predictably are frustrated due to significant communication struggles ; they regularly reject amplification  leaving them with no alternative treatments prior to availability of the hybrid system . 
 limitations to the study include the nonrandomized design  limited sample size  and duration of followup . using subjects as their own control enables clinically meaningful comparisons that account for patient heterogeneity  and use of standardized objective measures of hearing helps ensure validity . 
 the effect and sample size were large enough to produce statistically significant improvements after 6 months followup ; additional longer term followup for safety and study of the device in larger and diverse subgroups is important . 
 typically  this is not accessible through amplification for individuals with bilateral severe highfrequency hearing loss and beneficial  aidable lowfrequency hearing . 
 this system is a new and effective treatment that provides clinically significant improvements in speech understanding through integrated electric and acoustic stimulation in the implanted ear  with additional benefit when listening using both ears  thus fulfilling a need in individuals who to date have had no other treatment options .","

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of acoustic and electric sound processing for individuals with significant residual low frequency hearing and severe to profound high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. A prospective single-arm repeated measures design was used, and 50 participants received the cochlear nucleus hybrid l24 implant. Significantly improved speech perception and overall positive self-assessments were observed postoperatively.

Research and Discussion:
Fifty individuals between the ages of 18 and 70 with low frequency hearing and severe high frequency loss were assessed on consonant-nucleus-consonant word scores and AzBio sentences in noise pre- and postoperatively. The results showed significant improvements in both measures, with 96% of subjects performing equal or better on speech in quiet and 90% in noise. The self-assessment measures also yielded positive results, suggesting successful implementation of the device.

Results and Conclusion:
The nucleus hybrid system provides significant improvements in speech intelligibility in both quiet and noise for individuals with severe high frequency loss and some remaining low frequency hearing. This expands the indications for cochlear implantation to hearing-impaired individuals who previously did not qualify due to bilateral high frequency hearing loss and poor performance with amplification. This study provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the cochlear nucleus hybrid l24 implant."
"canine visceral leishmaniasis ( cvl ) is an infectious disease transmitted by sand flies and caused by leishmania infantum ( 1 ) . 
 it is a zoonotic endemic disease in most of the mediterranean area  asia  and latin america ( 2  3 ) . in iran 
 the prevalence of cvl in various parts of iran is different and it is correlated by weather condition and humidity ( 4 ) . 
 it is endemic in ardebil  east azerbaijan  fars and bushehr provinces ( 5 ) . 
 domestic dogs ( canis familiaris ) are the main reservoir hosts of human visceral leishmaniasis in iran ( 6 ) and the prevalence of vl in human  in distinct area  is associated with amount of cvl in dogs ( 4 ) . in foci of canine leishmaniasis  
 symptomatic disease is low and due to the systemic nature of the disease  clinical manifestations are variable ( 68 ) . 
 it seemed among different control strategies of the disease vaccination  if an efficient vaccine being accessible  is the best possible way for eradication of this disease in dogs ( 6 ) . 
 immunization with naked dna is the latest method  which promote both cd4- and cd8-mediated responses ( 9  10 ) . in the past few years 
  studies focused on some antigens such as gp63  cp  tsa  gp64  lmsti1  leif and p8  p4 and lack ( 11 ) . among of these antigens  lack gene is one of the best candidates in other strains of this pathogen ( 12 ) lack ( leishmania homologue of receptors for activated c kinase ) is a 36 kda protein localized in cytosol and external surface of the membrane ( 13 ) . 
 it is expressed in both promastigote and amastigote forms of the parasite ( 14 ) .

 canine s family  particularly domestic dogs are considered the main reservoir of zoonotic transmission ( 17 ) . 
 dogs usually develop the systemic form of infection  with a highly variable clinical appearance that may involve any organ  tissue  or body fluid and is manifested by non - specific clinical signs . 
 both symptomatic and asymptomatic leishmania - infected dogs act as a source of parasites for vl transmission ( 17 ) . 
 although anti leishmania drugs successfully used for human  vl therapy show low efficacy in canines ( 9  18 ) . thus  recent studies have tended to cvl control instead of treating . 
 control methods are variable  such as reservoir control  vector control  insecticide - impregnated materials and culling . but none of them were useful ( 8  9  19 ) . due to the simple nature of the parasite and this fact that recovery and resistance are the results of reinfection in leishmaniasis  vaccination against vl is feasible ( 13  20 ) . studies on a protective vaccine candidate have advanced in recent years and several vaccination methods and several antigens were tested . 
 immunization with naked dna ( dna vaccination ) is a new approach that promote both cd4 and cd8 mediated responses and helped to inducing a protective response against infection ( 10  15  21  22 ) . 
 . found that lack is required for parasite viability and it can be a potential drug target for leishmaniasis ( 20 ) . 
 lack might bind and enhance plasminogen activation in vivo promoting the formation of plasmin and might contribute to the invasiveness of the parasite ( 13 ) . in some studies  
 for example  the study on the combination of dna vectors expressing il-12 + il-18 and a booster with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing lack in mice revealed that this combined prime / booster immunization regime is an efficient approach to protect against leishmaniasis ( 14 ) . 
 heterologous prime - boost regime using dna and recombinant vaccinia virus vectors expressing lack was tested in some studies and relative protection was achieved ( 2225 ) . 
 lack dna vaccine induced a robust parasite - specific th1 immune response ( ifn- ) but it is not protective against cutaneous or systemic l. donovani challenge ( 15 ) . 
 cloning and expression of the lack gene of l. major iranian strain for immunology study and production of recombinant vaccine was done before ( 26  27 ) . according to prevalence and importance of visceral leishmaniasis in iran and necessity of production an efficient vaccine  we did this study . 
 the results of the blast in gene bank and western blot analyze showed that the gene correctly cloned in vector and it is active in immunological aspect . therefore  this study is a start of design a recombinant vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis in the future .","

1) Abstract: This study focuses on developing a DNA vaccine for visceral leishmaniasis using the lack gene, a 36kd protein, as a candidate protein. The lack gene was successfully cloned and expressed, showing potential for stimulating both cellular and humoral immunity. 

2) Research and Discussion: The Iranian strain of L. infantum was used to amplify the lack gene, which was then cloned in the pcdna3.1 expression vector. The recombinant plasmid was analyzed through sequencing, restriction digestion, and PCR, confirming the successful cloning. Lack protein expression was also analyzed through SDS-page and western blot. 

3) Results and Conclusion: The results demonstrated successful cloning and expression of the Iranian L. infantum lack gene, suggesting its potential as a candidate for vaccination against visceral leishmaniasis. This study highlights the importance of utilizing alternative methods, such as DNA vaccination, for controlling this disease due to the lack of an efficient vaccine. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of this vaccine in providing immunity against L. infantum."
"arterial stiffness is increased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm )  which can potentially increase the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases ( cvd ) . 
 the brachial - ankle pulse wave velocity ( bapwv ) is a non - invasive technique often used clinically for assessment of arterial wall stiffness and evaluation of the state of atherosclerosis and prediction of cvd in t2 dm patients [ 2  3 ] . 
 previous studies demonstrated that conventional risk factors for cvd  such as age  gender  body mass index ( bmi )  duration of t2 dm  glycemic control  dyslipidemia  systolic blood pressure ( sbp )  estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr )  uric acid and albuminuria  are associated with increased arterial stiffness in patients with t2 dm [ 1  4 - 6 ] . 
 however  life style - related problems were not fully taken into consideration in these studies  although the risk of cvd in patients with t2 dm correlates with numerous lifestyle problems [ 7  8 ] . 
 in fact  we recently demonstrated that poor sleep quality in patients with t2 dm correlates with increased arterial stiffness ; however  in that study  we did not take conventional cardiovascular risk factors into full consideration . 
 another study showed that low physical activity was associated with increased arterial stiffness in newly diagnosed patients with t2 dm . on the other hand  
 the association of other lifestyle habits  such as energy intake  morningness - eveningness  sleep duration and depressive state  with bapwv remains largely unknown in patients with t2 dm . the aim of the present study was to identify lifestyle habits that are associated with bapwv in t2 dm patients free of apparent cvd  using a model adjusted for numerous conventional cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle habits . 
 the subjects of this cohort study were recruited from three institutions : the diabetes outpatient clinic of juntendo university ( tokyo  japan )  naka memorial clinic ( naka  japan )  and secomedic hospital ( funabashi  japan ) [ 7  9  10 ] . 
 the inclusion criteria were as follows : 1 ) male and female t2 dm patients  2 ) age  25 and < 70 years  and 3 ) signing consent form for participation in the study . 
 the following exclusion criteria were also applied : 1 ) type 1 or secondary diabetes  2 ) presence of severe infection  recent surgery  or severe trauma  3 ) history of myocardial infarction  angina pectoris  or stroke  4 ) chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis  5 ) liver cirrhosis  6 ) moderate or severe heart failure ( nyha / new york heart association stage iii or higher )  7 ) active malignancy  8) pregnancy  lactation  or possible pregnancy  and 9 ) patients judged as ineligible by the clinical investigators . a total of 1032 consecutive subjects were screened . between june 2013 and january 2014  906 of 1032 patients who met the above eligibility criteria 
 were enrolled in this study . among the 906 patients  736 patients agreed to participate in the study . 
 the self - administered questionnaire survey to evaluate sleep quality used in the present study was the pittsburgh sleep quality index ( psqi ) [ 9  11 ] . 
 based on the total psqi score  patients were divided into three groups : the  good sleep quality group  with psqi score of  5   average sleep quality group  with psqi 6 - 8  and  poor sleep quality group  with psqi  9 . 
 we also used the morning - evening questionnaire ( meq )   to evaluate morningness and eveningness in individuals . 
 the remaining five questions allowed for choice of time scales and scored from 1 to 5 . 
 the sum of all scores was converted into three - point meq scales as follows : scores 16 - 52 represented the evening type  scores 53 - 64 represented the neither type  and scores 65 - 86 was considered the morning type  as reported previously . 
 the participating patients also completed the beck depression inventory ( bdi)-ii  which is a 21-item questionnaire that assesses hopelessness  irritability  cognition  guilt  fatigue  weight loss  and sexual interest  representing depression - related symptoms . 
 dietary habits during the preceding month were also assessed by the self - administered diet history questionnaire ( bdhq ) . 
 briefly  the four - page structured bdhq includes questions on selected foods and is designed to estimate the dietary consumption of 56 food and beverage items . 
 physical activity level was assessed with the four - question international physical activity questionnaire ( ipaq )  and the results were expressed as metabolic equivalent scores ( metsh / week ) . in the above questionnaires  
 the subjects were also divided into non - smokers  former smokers and current smokers . 
 blood samples were collected at the outpatient clinic after overnight fast and liver and renal function tests  lipid profile and hba1c ( national glycohemoglobin standardization program ) were measured with standard techniques . 
 urinary albumin excretion ( uae ) was measured by the latex agglutination assay using a spot urine sample . 
 the egfr was calculated by the formula : egfr ( ml / min/1.73 m ) = 194  age  serum creatinine (  0.739 for females ) . 
 bapwv was measured using an automatic waveform analyzer ( bp-203rpe ; colin medical technology  komaki  japan )  as described previously [ 7  9  10 ] . 
 briefly  recording was performed with the patients in the supine position after 5-min rest . 
 occlusion and monitoring cuffs were placed snugly around both areas in the upper and lower extremities . 
 the pressure waveforms were then recorded simultaneously from the brachial arteries by the oscillometric method . 
 all scans were automatically conducted by well - trained investigators who were blinded to the clinical information . 
 a resting ankle - brachial index of  0.90 was considered to reflect the presence of peripheral artery disease . 
 the diagnosis of peripheral artery disease based on the ankle - brachial index was further confirmed by computed tomographic angiography  magnetic resonance angiography or catheter angiography . 
 based on the data obtained from the above procedures  six patients with arterial lumen narrowing of  50% were excluded from analysis . 
 results were presented as mean  sd or median ( interquartile range : 25 - 75% ) for continuous variables or number ( proportion ) of patients for categorical variables . 
 multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate whether possible cardiovascular risk factors evaluated by clinical  biochemical  metabolic tests and lifestyle habits were associated with bapwv in patients with t2 dm free of apparent cvd . 
 conventional atherosclerotic risk factors based on clinical judgment and certain life styles were included in the model . 
 all analyses were performed using the sas software version 9.3 ( sas institute  cary  nc ) .

 est : standardized estimate of regression parameter ; alt : alanine aminotransferase ; ast : aspartate aminotransferase ; bapwv : brachial - ankle pulse wave velocity ; egfr : estimated glomerular filtration rate ; hdl - c : high - density lipoprotein - cholesterol ; uae : urinary albumin excretion ; -gtp : -glutamyl transpeptidase . 
 in agreement with previous studies [ 1  4 - 6  20 ]  our data demonstrated that conventional cardiovascular risk factors  such as age  duration of t2 dm  sbp  uric acid and uae  were associated with increased arterial stiffness in patients with t2 dm even after adjustment for some lifestyle habits . 
 furthermore  we found that poor sleep quality was associated with arterial stiffness even after adjustment for several conventional cardiovascular risk factors and other lifestyle habits . in this regard 
  a previous report demonstrated that high levels of catecholamines caused by poor sleep quality may be associated with progression of arterial stiffness in healthy middle - aged adults . 
 high catecholamine levels could promote smooth muscle cell proliferation and fibrosis  leading to structural changes in the arterial wall . 
 although the study design does not allow evaluation of causal relations  the above data suggest that poor sleep quality may be an important target of interventions that can prevent arterial stiffness in patients with t2 dm . in contrast 
  our data failed to show close association of other lifestyle problems  such as energy intake  physical activity  morningness - eveningness  sleep duration and depressive state  with arterial stiffness in patients with t2 dm . 
 a recent clinical trial demonstrated that life style interventions  with a special focus on reduced calorie intake and increased physical activity  did not affect the rate of cvd in obese t2 dm patients . 
 it is possible that not only caloric intake  but rather dietary composition  may need to be modified to prevent or delay the development of cvd in patients with t2 dm . 
 while previous reports demonstrated that bmi was positively associated with arterial stiffness [ 5  20  24  25 ]  bmi was inversely associated with arterial stiffness in this study  consistent with a previous report in non - t2 dm patients . 
 the exact explanation for the conflicting results is unknown ; however  a previous study showed higher bapwv levels in t2 dm patients with normal bmi and increased visceral adiposity compared to those with higher bmi and normal visceral adiposity . 
 generally  increased visceral adiposity is associated with insulin resistance  which increases the production of inflammatory cytokines  leading to arterial stiffness . 
 since asians tend to have insulin resistance even with normal bmi  evaluation of visceral adiposity may be helpful in the assessment of effect of obesity on arterial stiffness in these subjects . 
 a close association between serum uric acid and arterial stiffness in male patients with newly diagnosed t2 dm was reported previously  even after adjustment for several risk factors for atherosclerosis . in the present study 
  we demonstrated a significant association between serum uric acid and arterial stiffness in a wider range of t2 dm population than the above study  even after adjustment for lifestyle habits in addition to numerous cardiovascular risk factors . 
 however  whether serum uric acid plays an important role or is a potentially useful sensitive marker for identifying patients at high risk for cvd is not clear in this cross - sectional study . 
 indeed  the deleterious effect of hyperuricemia on arterial stiffness may be mediated through other interactive cardiovascular risk factors and/or the effect of hyperuricemia may depend on the stage of atherosclerosis [ 6  29 ] . 
 first  the cross - sectional design does not allow evaluation of the causal relationship between risk factors for atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness . 
 third  we can not rule out the possible effects of other lifestyle habits that we did not assessed in this study on arterial stiffness . in conclusion 
  we found that several conventional cardiovascular risk factors  such as age  duration of t2 dm  sbp  serum uric acid  uae  lower bmi and poor sleep quality were associated with bapwv even after adjustment for multiple traditional cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle habits .

1) Abstract: This study analyzed variables associated with arterial stiffness in Japanese type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Results showed a positive association with age, male sex, duration of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, serum uric acid, urinary albumin excretion, and poor sleep quality.

2) Research and Discussion: Researchers investigated associations between conventional cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle habits, and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (BAPWV) in Japanese type 2 diabetes patients. Results showed age, male sex, and poor sleep quality were positively associated with BAPWV even after adjusting for other risk factors.

3) Results and Conclusion: The mean age of the 724 participants was 57.8 years with 62.8% being males. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that age, duration of diabetes, and several cardiovascular risk factors were associated with BAPWV. Poor sleep quality was also significantly associated with BAPWV in Japanese type 2 diabetes patients. This demonstrates the importance of considering lifestyle habits when assessing arterial stiffness in these patients."
"we began our investigation of what high reliability might mean for health care by analyzing what is known about how highly reliable organizations function . 
 weick and sutcliffe provide the most compelling depiction of how high - reliability organizations ( hros ) stay safe . 
 they describe an environment of  collective mindfulness  in which all workers look for  and report  small problems or unsafe conditions before they pose a substantial risk to the organization and when they are easy to fix ( weick and sutcliffe 2007 ) . 
 they prize the identification of errors and close calls for the lessons they can extract from a careful analysis of what occurred before these events . 
 these lessons point to specific weaknesses in safety protocols or procedures that can be remedied to reduce the risk of future failures . 
 the five high - reliability principles that weick and sutcliffe spell out further elucidate the capability of high - reliability organizations to achieve and maintain exemplary levels of safety . 
 hros are preoccupied with failure  never satisfied that they have not had an accident for many months or many years  and they are always alert to the smallest signal that a new threat to safety may be developing . 
 people who work in hros also resist the temptation to simplify their observations and their experiences of their environment . 
 threats to safety can be complex and present themselves in many different forms . accordingly  being able to identify the often subtle differences among threats may make the difference between early and late recognition  between finding an unsafe condition when it is easy to correct and failing to recognize a problem until it is getting out of control . 
 hros recognize that the earliest indicators of threats to organizational performance typically appear in small changes in the organization 's operations . 
 they thus take great pains to ensure that all those workers who are most intimately involved in operations always report any deviations from expected performance . in addition  hros make sure that everyone not only feels free to speak up with any concerns but also recognizes an obligation to do so because of how highly the organization values the information as a vital component of its ability to achieve its highest priority : near - perfect safety . 
 hros recognize that despite all their best efforts and past safety successes  errors will occur and safety will be threatened . 
 the hallmark of an hro is not that it is error - free but that errors do n't disable it 
 resilience refers to an organization 's capability to recognize errors quickly and contain them  thereby preventing the harm that results when small errors propagate  are compounded  and mushroom into major problems . 
 when confronted by a new threat  hros have mechanisms in place to identify the individuals with the greatest expertise relevant to managing the new situation and to place decision - making authority in the hands of that person or group . 
 they do not invoke organizational hierarchy or expect that the person with the most seniority or highest rank will be the most effective at dealing with the problem . 
 how close or far away is the typical hospital today from this state of high reliability ? 
  we rarely observe the five principles of high reliability guiding the actions of organizations  their leaders  and caregivers . 
 as opposed to a preoccupation with avoiding failure  hospitals and other health care organizations behave as if they accept failure as an inevitable feature of their daily work . 
 how else could we explain the estimates that 99000 americans die in hospitals each year from health care  associated infections while hand hygiene compliance routinely registers in the 40 percent range  among many other examples ? 
 fortunately  these events happen only rarely  from the perspective of an individual surgeon or hospital  but we are not close to eliminating them entirely from american health care . in health care  the rarity of adverse events like these tends to reinforce organizations beliefs that they will never experience them and leads to a misplaced confidence that their safety systems are adequate . 
 this complacency blunts the alertness of surgical teams to the small signs of a risk of a surgical fire or wrong - site surgery . 
 hros recognize that complacency itself is a threat to safety and so take great pains to not let it take root . failing to resist 
 for example  we often approach a quality problem with a simple  one - size - fits - all  best practice  solution . 
 the joint commission 's universal protocol  developed to eliminate wrong - site surgery  is one such example . 
 it consists of three simple steps : ( 1 ) verify the identity of the patient and the intended procedure  ( 2 ) mark the surgical site  and ( 3 ) conduct a  time - out  in the operating room just before the surgery begins in order to verify again that the patient  the procedure  and the operative site are correctly identified . but 
 this overly simple approach has not eliminated the problem  in large part because it fails to account for the complexities of the surgical process and all the different ways in which risks of a wrong - site procedure may be introduced into it . for example  such risks may arise while scheduling the surgical procedure  a set of problems that the universal protocol does not address . 
 one of the most pervasive safety problems in hospitals relates to their failure to be sensitive to operations . 
 health care workers at all levels routinely observe unsafe conditions  behaviors  and practices  but they very often fail to bring those problems to the attention of managers who are placed appropriately in the daily work flow to address the problems quickly . 
 transitions from one care setting to another ( so - called handoffs ) are fraught with the risk of error due to the incomplete or inaccurate communication of crucial patient information . 
 when caregivers come to expect poor communication  they become desensitized to its hazards . in one analysis  such a  culture of low expectations  explained a substantial number of the errors that led to a patient 's undergoing an invasive procedure that was intended for someone else ( chassin and becher 2002 ) . 
 thus  the lack of recognition of unsafe conditions or practices is one important reason they are not reported . 
 in addition  health care workers of all kinds are exposed to an inordinate amount of intimidating behavior that suppresses their reporting of safety problems . 
 physicians are often seen as the initiators of intimidating or disrespectful behavior  and nurses are commonly seen as its targets ( leape et al . 
 2012 ; saxton  hines  and enriquez 2009 ) . but caregivers of all kinds are involved in these unsafe situations . in 2004 
  the institute for safe medication practices published the results of its workplace intimidation survey  which focused on the process of receiving  interpreting  and acting on medication orders ( institute for safe medication practices 2004 ) . 
 more than two thousand respondents  mainly nurses and pharmacists  reported a variety of these behaviors that they had personally experienced in the preceding twelve months . 
 the most common behaviors perceived as intimidating were not the flagrantly abusive practices of throwing objects or using loud or profane language . 
 rather  the failure to return phone calls or pages  the use of condescending language  and impatience with questions topped the list . 
 between 60 and 67 percent of the respondents said they had personally experienced such behaviors initiated by physicians three or more times in the preceding year  and 20 to 28 percent said that they had experienced those behaviors more than ten times . 
 the caregivers who experienced these behaviors employed a variety of strategies  all suboptimal and risky  to deal with them  including asking someone else to talk to an intimidating prescriber about a safety concern regarding a medication order ( 39% )  refraining from contacting the prescriber while attempting to clarify the safety of a drug order on their own ( 67% )  or asking colleagues to help interpret an order to avoid having to interact with a particular prescriber ( 75% ) . 
 hros do not tolerate the existence of intimidating behaviors that suppress the reporting of safety concerns and perpetuate the existence of unsafe conditions . 
 a specific example helps illuminate the complexities of the barriers that hospitals face in trying to be sensitive to these safety signals . many medical devices employed in routine hospital care come equipped with alarms that make various sounds when preset parameters are exceeded . 
 intravenous infusion pumps  cardiac rate and rhythm monitors  mechanical ventilators  and blood oxygen monitors are some of the more common ones . 
 caregivers are bombarded hourly by these alarms  especially those working in intensive care areas housing the sickest patients with the greatest number of devices per patient . 
 the number of alarms that sound per patient per day can total several hundred . for 
 a variety of reasons  the vast majority ( perhaps as many as 85% to 99% ) of these alarm sounds do not signify clinical situations of danger . 
 these reasons include poor integration of devices with one another  equipment malfunction  inappropriate alarm settings  and gaps in staff training . 
 the result is that caregivers experience  alarm fatigue  and may take a variety of unsafe actions  such as turning off the alarms entirely  turning down the sound volume to the point of inaudibility  resetting the alarm to unsafe levels  or ignoring the alarm sounds altogether ( joint commission 2013 ) . 
 the joint commission 's voluntary adverse event reporting program recorded ninety - eight alarm - related events between 2009 and june 2012  with eighty of them resulting in death . 
 the ecri institute has cited this problem as one of the top ten health technology hazards each year since 2007 ( ecri institute 2012 ) . a comprehensive solution to this problem 
 would require many stakeholders to work together  including device manufacturers  information technology experts  physicians  medical informatics professionals  nurses  clinical engineers  and hospital administrators . 
 imagine the risks to safety if a nuclear power plant had alarm systems that functioned in this fashion . 
 hospitals and health care organizations do not exhibit the features of resilience that characterize hros . in a high - reliability environment  
 errors and unsafe conditions are recognized early and prevented by rapid remediation from causing harm . 
 but in health care  uncoordinated and poorly designed and maintained mechanical systems ( like medical device alarms ) are tolerated  even though they are not safe . 
 intimidating behaviors suppress reporting and lead to additional unsafe behaviors as caregivers create workarounds to avoid repetitive exposure to intimidators . 
 errors are not seen as valuable information  essential to a hospital 's ability to improve patient safety . in its 2012 report of the results of its annual patient safety culture survey  
 the federal agency for healthcare research and quality stated that on average  65 percent of respondents from 1128 hospitals worried that mistakes they had made were kept in their personnel files  and 50 percent agreed that staff felt that their mistakes were held against them ( agency for healthcare research and quality 2012 ) . 
 finally  in attempting to solve safety and quality problems  hospitals do not regularly permit the most expert individual to implement solutions . 
 pharmacists often have a difficult time bringing their considerable expertise to bear to avoid medication errors . too often 
  health care teams are multidisciplinary in name only  with physicians or senior administrators dominating the scene . 
 westrum coined this term during a sociological analysis of why pediatricians failed to identify child abuse until the 1960s . 
 he suggested that one of the important underlying phenomena was pediatricians ingrained belief that they were 
 if something as crucial to a child 's health as physical abuse by a parent were going on  surely pediatricians would know about it and bring it to the attention of other pediatricians . 
 but they did n't know about it  and therefore it was n't happening ( westrum 1982 ) 
 . in health care  the risk of an individual 's falling prey to the fallacy of centrality would seem to increase with seniority . 
 this mind - set is particularly risky for organizational leaders because it encourages the risky belief that  no news is good news . 
 in hospitals   no news  most often means that intimidated caregivers are not recognizing or reporting the unsafe conditions that will  soon enough  harm patients . 
 thus  available data and considerable experience suggest strongly that the five principles of high reliability would be unrecognizable in an average hospital 's daily work . to the contrary  in several instances  particularly those involving the rapid identification and management of errors and unsafe conditions 
  it appears that today 's hospitals often exhibit the very opposite of high reliability . 
 there is an important corollary to the observation that hospitals are currently characterized by low reliability . 
 this fact implies strongly that hospitals can not solve these problems by simply and directly adopting high - reliability principles and practices all at once . 
 imagine what might happen if all the workers in a hospital suddenly acquired a keen sense of collective mindfulness and began to recognize and report all the unsafe conditions and errors they encountered from the moment they arrived at the hospital . 
 the organization would soon be so deluged with such reports that its capacity to fix the problems uncovered by the reports would be overwhelmed  and many unsafe conditions would necessarily remain unaddressed . 
 of course  such a transformation of an organization 's culture can not take place over night . 
 we must take careful note of how hospitals function today in all the key arenas that must change if high reliability is to become possible for them . 
 this possibility will become more real if we can accurately describe hospitals current state and chart a plausible and feasible pathway toward high reliability  one that defines specific milestones representing incremental progress . 
 is there any guidance in the high - reliability literature on how to chart such a pathway ? not much . 
 weick and sutcliffe offer a series of  audits  or rating scales that assess the extent to which an organization is behaving like an hro and give some general advice about how to improve ( weick and sutcliffe 2007  chaps . 5 and 6 ) . but 
 reason offers a similar assessment tool  his  checklist for assessing institutional resilience ( cair )   and has adapted it for health care ( carthey  de leval  and reason 2001 ) . 
 these thoughtful contributions help focus us on what hospitals should be doing to become highly reliable . 
 but they do not give us much insight into precisely how these goals can be accomplished . 
 in brief  we know of no well - documented blueprints for elevating a low - reliability organization or industry into a highly reliable one and sustaining that achievement over time . 
 as noted earlier  we described elsewhere a broad conceptual framework for adapting high - reliability science to health care organizations ( chassin and loeb 2011 ) . 
 this framework was derived from the integration of high - reliability science  our considerable experience working with the thousands of health care organizations that the joint commission accredits or certifies  and some studies explaining how some hospitals have started to adapt high - reliability principles to their operations ( dixon and shofer 2006 ; fei and vlasses 2008 ; frankel  leonard  and denham 2006 ; may 2013 ; wolterman and shabot 2012 ) . 
 we explored three major changes that health care organizations would have to undertake in order to make substantial progress toward high reliability : ( 1 ) the leadership 's commitment to the ultimate goal of zero patient harm  ( 2 ) the incorporation of all the principles and practices of a safety culture throughout the organization  and ( 3 ) the widespread adoption and deployment of the most effective process improvement tools and methods . 
 we elaborate here these three changes with specific respect to hospitals and health systems . by leadership commitment  
 we mean the aligned agreement of the governing body  typically a board of trustees or directors  senior management  and physician and nurse leaders . 
 all the constituencies of leadership  both formal and informal  must share the same singular vision of eventually eliminating harms to patients . 
 this is an essential initial requirement  because the success of all the other changes depends on it . 
 the goal of zero also is important because one of the most salient characteristics of high - reliability organizations is that they are not satisfied with whatever their current level of safety might be . 
 commercial aviation averaged 129 deaths per year from accidents and logged an average of 9.3 million flights per year  translating into a death rate of 13.9 deaths per million flights . in the next decade  however  from 2002 to 2011  that death rate plummeted by a remarkable 88 percent to 1.6 deaths per million flights . 
 even though the average annual number of flights increased to 10.4 million per year  the number of deaths dropped to an average of 16.6 per year ( u.s . department of transportation 2012 ) . 
 for the past thirty years  commercial aviation has invested heavily in radically changing flight crews culture in order to advance airline safety . 
 this work began following research conducted by the national aeronautics and space administration in the 1970s demonstrating that the majority of airplane crashes were caused not by catastrophic mechanical failures but by failures of communication among pilots and crew . 
 the development and worldwide deployment of focused and highly effective training programs to establish a safety culture on aircraft flight decks followed . 
 these programs  known as crew resource management  are widely credited with playing the most important role in the dramatic safety improvements the industry witnessed over this time period ( helmreich  merritt  and wilhelm 1999 ) . 
 one of the original developers of crew resource management for the airline industry has since turned his attention to health care . 
 he and his colleagues found that the professional culture in operating rooms and the communication errors related to it were quite similar to those found among aircraft crews ( helmreich 2000 ) . 
 this work has led to a series of efforts to apply the principles and methods of crew resource management to health care ( gordon  mendenhall  and o'connor 2013 ) . since 2009 
  the joint commission has required the leadership of all health care organizations that it accredits to  create and maintain a culture of safety 
 consequently  many hospitals now conduct staff surveys to assess their safety culture ( agency for healthcare research and quality 2012 ; sexton et al . 
 few  however  have moved beyond tabulating survey results to taking effective actions that have resulted in creating the kind of safety culture that supports high reliability . 
 we have few proven tools or methods that can guide hospital leaders to achieve a fully functional safety culture . 
 the model we describe in our practical framework is derived from the work of reason and hobbs ( reason and hobbs 2003 ) . the organizational culture they depict 
 is based on reason 's years of studying complex organizations and how they prevent or fail to prevent accidents that cause harm . 
 we believe that this model is the one most adaptable and appropriate to health care . 
 the third of the major changes relates to how hospitals carry out efforts to improve the performance of their care processes . 
 it is in this domain that high - reliability science provides the least guidance to health care . 
 hros do not have safety processes that fail 40 to 60 percent of the time  which is the case in health care ( e.g.  hand hygiene and handoff communication ) ( bodenheimer 2008 ; erasmus et al . 
 the specific tools and methods that hros use to maintain their nearly perfect safety procedures are not directly relevant in a setting with reliability as low as that of health care . 
 we believe that three sets of process improvement tools  lean  six sigma  and change management  constitute the most effective way for health care to dramatically enhance its capacity to create nearly perfect safety processes ( dellifraine  langabeer  and nembhard 2010 ; dupree et al . 
 we call the three  robust process improvement   or rpi ( joint commission center for transforming healthcare 2013 ) . 
 they represent the next generation of process improvement methods that were developed in industry and imported into health care . 
 they are proving to be far more effective in addressing complex clinical quality and safety problems than pdca (  plan  do  check  act  ) or their more immediate predecessors ( continuous quality improvement and total quality management ) ( goldberg 2000 ) . 
 one of the most important distinguishing features of these newer improvement methods is their systematic attention to uncovering all the very specific causes of the failures of safety processes ( e.g.  hand hygiene ) . by pinpointing specific causes ( e.g.  improper use of gloves or faulty maintenance procedures that do not keep hand gel dispensers full ) and by measuring which ones are most prevalent in a particular area of a hospital  these tools direct improvement efforts to eliminate the causes of the majority of failures . by their careful attention to unraveling the complexities of health care quality and safety problems  the tools of robust process improvement offer health care the means to implement the  reluctance to simplify  principle of high reliability . 
 the joint commission has adopted rpi as its internal process improvement methodology and  in the first five years of the program  which began in 2008  trained 35 percent of its workforce in using these tools ( adrian 2009 ) . since 2009  
 the joint commission 's center for transforming healthcare has been applying these rpi tools together with teams from hospitals around the country that also have mastered their use to address a number of health care 's most persistent quality and safety problems . 
 table 1 shows the rates of improvement demonstrated in the center 's first four projects . 
 the joint commission 's experience is consistent with that of companies such as ge that have employed the same tools for many years with great benefit ( bartlett and wozny 2005 ; rao 2011 ) . 
 improvements seen in four projects using robust process improvement notes : robust process improvement is a combination of three complementary process improvement methods : lean  six sigma  and change management . 
 percentage of times that caregivers cleaned their hands before walking into or out of a patient 's room . 
 having established these three major domains of change  we then considered how hospitals and health systems operate today and how they might evolve ( slowly or rapidly ) toward high reliability in each of these three areas . 
 clearly  the industry contains much heterogeneity  but observing those differences helps better characterize the current state and directions for that evolution . in devising this framework 
  we identified several specific components of each of the three domains of change ( fourteen components in all ) and four stages of maturity for each of them that would define progress toward high reliability . 
 we observed hospitals or health systems in which a few or several of these components currently reside in each of these four stages of high reliability . 
 but we intentionally did not attempt to add a fifth stage ( perhaps to be labeled  arriving  in the future ) that would describe a high - reliability hospital  because we know of no hospitals that have achieved high reliability across all their activities and  therefore  have no firsthand observations to use for such a description . 
 we created this framework over a two - year period  employing a variety of methods and sources . 
 a team at the joint commission has been engaged with high - reliability experts from academia and industry since 2010 to assimilate what is known about hros with the institutional knowledge we have gained from our work in health care quality and safety . 
 these experts include widely published authors and officials and executives from hros in commercial aviation  the chemical and petroleum industries  nuclear power  and the military . among other activities 
  the joint commission hosted the fifth international high - reliability conference in may 2012  at which health care executives interacted with representatives from academia and hros from ten different industries ( joint commission 2012 ) . 
 to produce the first draft of the framework  we combined the information gleaned from these experiences with the empirical literature on the characteristics of hospitals associated with improved safety and quality . 
 we then conducted two rounds of pilot testing with health care leaders . in the first round  
 a small group of five individuals with hospital leadership roles as chief quality officers  chief medical officers  or chief executive officers examined the framework and provided qualitative assessments of its face validity  including whether all appropriate elements were included in the framework and whether any should be eliminated or defined differently . 
 separately  we produced for their review a self - assessment questionnaire designed to elicit information from hospital leaders that would permit us to assign each of the fourteen components of high reliability to one of the four stages of maturity . 
 based on this first round of reviews  we made appropriate changes in the framework and the questionnaire . in the second round of testing 
 each team engaged in this process four to six leaders from a variety of different leadership perspectives  which included chief executive officers  chief nursing officers  chief medical officers  chief quality officers  chief information officers  and others with similar responsibilities . 
 we compiled the data from this round of testing and convened a face - to - face meeting with the teams leaders  typically the chief executive officer  of each of the seven hospitals to discuss the experiences of their teams . 
 the results of this round of testing were incorporated into the framework and questionnaire  which were finalized for further field - testing . 
 table 2 depicts the six components of leadership and each one 's characteristics in the four stages of maturity . 
 the six components are the board of trustees  the chief executive officer and all senior management ( including nursing leaders )  the engagement of physicians  the hospital 's quality strategy  its use and dissemination of data on measures of quality  and the use of information technology to support quality and safety improvement . 
 the identification of these specific components is supported by published literature linking them to better quality performance ( goeschel  wachter  and pronovost 2010 ; jha and epstein 2010 ; weiner  shortell  and alexander 1997 ) . 
 the hospital leaders commitment to high reliability must include a prominent role for the board of trustees or directors . 
 the board must be part of the leadership 's commitment to eventually achieve zero patient harm and to elevate quality and patient safety to the organization 's highest strategic goal . 
 if the board is left out  management will find its efforts unsupported or misunderstood . 
 today  hospital boards vary over a wide spectrum of involvement in the quality programs of the hospitals they oversee ( jha and epstein 2010 ) . leadership and high reliability : stages of organizational maturity in addition  physicians are essential to the success of any quality initiative in hospitals . 
 table 2 identifies two vital components of physicians role : leadership and participation . in order to move effectively toward high reliability  physicians must routinely champion quality improvement initiatives throughout the hospital . both the formally appointed leaders ( chief medical officer  vice president for medical affairs ) and the informal leaders ( medical staff president  voluntary medical staff leaders ) need to be visible and active enthusiasts for quality  including physician leaders who are not employees of the hospital . 
 it is difficult to imagine a hospital getting close to high reliability if quality is merely one of many competing priorities . 
 memorial hermann health system  a twelve - hospital health care system based in houston  has explicitly committed to becoming highly reliable and has specified the importance of all the major ingredients in this framework to their efforts ( shabot et al . 
  the system 's ceo pointed out   ensuring patient safety is our core value  and it 's our only core value 
 ( wolterman and shabot 2012 ) . to accelerate the progress toward zero harm  quality must be measured and data on those measures must be widely available both within the hospital and to the public . 
 not only is such transparency valuable in its own right  but public reporting also is a powerful added force that drives improvement . the quality program and its measures should focus on meeting the needs and addressing the specific quality problems of the hospital 's patient population . 
 other incentives  such as the judicious use of financial rewards and staff advancement opportunities based on performance against quality measures  are important accelerants as well . 
 finally  leaders are obligated to employ health information technology ( it ) effectively in the service of quality improvement . 
 it is particularly important to an hro  because it is frequently the vehicle by which nearly perfect processes sustain their performance . 
 if a process has been so effectively redesigned as to be highly reliable  automating it is the most effective way to maintain it in that state . 
 unfortunately  in health care  automation is often deployed unsafely  a phenomenon that increases rather than decreases the risk of harm ( ash et al . 
 in addition  various types of health it are often not coordinated  thereby increasing risk . 
 for example  if programmable infusion devices are not supported by the same decision support rules that govern pharmacy systems and physician order entry systems  the resulting confusion can be life threatening for patients . 
 a hospital approaching high reliability adopts health it solutions in a coordinated and integrated manner following the principles of safe adoption ( joint commission 2008b ; karsh 2004 ) . 
 table 3 shows the five components of safety culture and their manifestations in each of the four stages of maturity toward high reliability . 
 a culture of safety that fully supports high reliability has three central attributes : trust  report  and improve ( reason and hobbs 2003 ) . 
 workers exhibit enough trust in their peers and the organization 's management that they routinely recognize and report errors and unsafe conditions . 
 this trust is established when the organization eliminates intimidating behavior that suppresses reporting  acts in a timely way to fix the problems reported by workers  and communicates these improvements consistently to the individuals who reported the problems in the first place . that communication in turn strengthens 
 the trust that led to the reports and fosters further identification and reporting of problems even further upstream from harm . 
 when all three of these components of a safety culture ( trust  report  and improve ) are working well  they reinforce one another and produce a stable organizational culture that sustains high reliability . 
 safety culture and high reliability : stages of organizational maturity maintaining trust also requires the organization to hold employees accountable for adhering to safety protocols and procedures . 
 hros establish clear  equitable  and transparent processes for recognizing and separating the small  blameless errors that all people make every day from unsafe or reckless actions that are blameworthy . 
 understanding how and why blameless errors occur is part of the learning process that hros employ to maintain their exemplary safety records . 
 recognizing and dealing appropriately with blameworthy acts is an equally important dimension of an hro 's safety culture because of its vital role in maintaining trust . 
 unfortunately  health care organizations too often punish staff for blameless acts while failing to implement equitable disciplinary procedures for those who commit blameworthy acts . nor have hospital leaders succeeded in eradicating intimidating behaviors ( institute for safe medication practices 2004 ) . 
 these failings explain the lack of trust among hospital staff noted earlier ( agency for healthcare research and quality 2012 ) . 
 hospitals that move toward high reliability establish codes of behavior that are modeled by leaders ( including nurses and physicians ) who champion efforts to eliminate intimidation and encourage and reward the reporting of blameless errors and unsafe conditions . 
 accountability for adhering to safe practices should be ingrained in all employees and is spurred by implementing standards for invoking disciplinary procedures that apply to all staff  regardless of seniority or professional credentials . 
 for example  maimonides medical center in new york city has established such a program in its code of mutual respect  which commits all stakeholders ( including physicians  nurses  staff  students  vendors  consultants  and volunteers ) to  working harmoniously  together and to eliminate intimidating behaviors . 
 the program includes progressive interventions  including disciplinary actions for individuals who repeatedly violate the code ( maimonides medical center 2009 ) . 
 hros also proactively assess the strength and resilience of their safety systems and the organizational defenses that prevent errors from propagating and leading to harm . 
 today 's hospitals function in primarily a reactive mode  investigating incidents in which patients have already been harmed  conducting root cause analyses  and instituting corrective action plans to prevent future occurrences . 
 becoming much safer requires caregivers willingness and ability to recognize and report close calls and unsafe conditions  combined with an organizational capacity to act effectively on those reports to eliminate the risks they embody . 
 furthermore  as opposed to today 's norm of focusing on single events  hospitals should compile the results of their investigations across many harm events and close calls to identify which of their safety systems or defenses are most in need of improvement . 
 these evaluations should lead to the development of proactive assessments of key safety systems ( e.g.  those that relate to medication administration and infection prevention and control ) so that weaknesses can be identified and remedied before they pose any significant risk to patients . 
 finally  progress toward establishing all these elements of a culture of safety should be measured . today 
  many hospitals regularly use one of several available staff surveys to assess their safety culture . 
 few  however  analyze the meaning of the survey data  evaluate where each area of the hospital is falling short  and undertake specific  focused interventions to remedy those shortcomings . 
 as hospitals make more progress toward high reliability  they will include safety culture metrics as part of their strategic planning programs  set goals for improving on those metrics  and report on those metrics to their boards  just as they report on metrics related to financial performance or patient satisfaction . 
 hospitals need new process improvement tools and methods to break out of their current state of low reliability . 
 we have argued that robust process improvement ( rpi)a combination of lean  six sigma  and change management  is a much more potent set of tools than health care currently uses to address safety and quality problems . 
 briefly  and oversimplifying somewhat  lean is a set of tools and a philosophy of employee - empowered improvement that identifies and removes wasted effort from processes without compromising the quality of the outcome . 
 six sigma tools focus on improving the outcomes of a process by radically reducing the frequency with which defective products or outcomes occur . 
 change management is a systematic approach  used alongside lean and six sigma  that prepares an organization to accept  implement  and sustain the improved processes that result from the application of lean and six sigma tools . 
 these three sets of tools are complementary  and together they provide the best available methods for hospitals to achieve major improvements in faulty processes . table 4 shows the three components of rpi and how each changes as a hospital comes closer to high reliability . like ge  
 best buy  and other companies that have benefited from rpi  we believe that getting the most benefit from them requires that they be employed as a common language throughout the entire organization ( bartlett and wozny 2005 ; rao 2011 ) . nearly all employees should be trained at levels appropriate to each one 's job . 
 the tools should be used throughout the organization for all improvement work . finally  proficiency in the use of rpi should be a part of every employee 's performance appraisal and be required for career advancement within the organization . 
 these elements provide vital support for spreading the use of these tools . for hros  quality and safety 
 are the personal responsibility of every employee  and being armed with highly effective ways to solve complex problems gives employees some of what they need to exercise that responsibility . 
 robust process improvement and high reliability : stages of organizational maturity today 's hospitals generally lag far behind this ideal state . some have used some of the elements of rpi  often starting with lean  but relatively few hospitals have adopted the full suite of rpi tools . 
 rpi provides highly effective tools for obtaining the  voice of the customer   and the perspective of patients on what constitutes a high - quality outcome for a particular care process is vital to its improvement . 
 making substantial progress toward high reliability in safety and quality requires the application of tools like rpi that can generate extremely high rates of sustainable improvement when applied to the poorly performing safety processes that exist in most hospitals today ( see table 1 ) . 
 we know of no other approach to process improvement available at present that is capable of generating and sustaining rates of improvement of this magnitude consistently over the widest array of areas  from clinical quality to business processes ( chassin 1998 ; r. chassin 2008 ) . enabling hospitals to use this high - reliability health care framework requires additional work . to advance toward high reliability 
  hospitals must be able to assess their current state of maturity with respect to each of the framework 's fourteen components and then to access proven strategies  tools  and methods to advance to more mature levels . 
 the joint commission is developing and testing an instrument that will permit hospital leaders to perform such an assessment . 
 the utility of the assessment to hospitals in identifying their most pressing opportunities for making progress toward high reliability and the availability of specific tools to facilitate such progress is currently being field - tested . 
 this initiative  the south carolina safe care commitment  is being led by the joint commission center for transforming healthcare and the south carolina hospital association ( may 2013 ) . those stakeholders with a vested interest in moving health care 
 further and faster toward high reliability include state and federal government health agencies  consumer and patient advocacy groups  employers  public and private payers  health care professional organizations  and hospitals and health systems themselves . 
 although a comprehensive assessment of these roles is beyond the scope of this article  several observations are nonetheless pertinent here . 
 regulation had only a modest and supportive role in the dramatic quality and safety improvements in other industries ( e.g.  commercial aviation  car manufacturing  and consumer electronics ) . in health care 
  regulators should pay attention first and foremost to identifying and eliminating requirements that obstruct progress toward high reliability . in some instances  
 they impose unproductive work on regulated organizations that distracts them from dealing more effectively with their quality challenges . 
 regulators can support the transformation to high reliability  for example  by well - crafted programs of publicly reporting reliable and valid measures of quality . other u.s . 
 industries have undergone transformations in quality stimulated primarily by competitive pressures ( e.g.  from japanese automakers ) . a similar occurrence in health care 
 is difficult to imagine because of the intensely local environment in which the large majority of hospitals and health systems operate ( becher and chassin 2001 ) . because the changes health care must undergo to become highly reliable are so thoroughgoing and profound  the primary drive for change must ultimately come from the health care organizations themselves . 
 as the saying goes  it takes only one psychiatrist to change a lightbulb  but the lightbulb has to want to change . 
 many health care leaders are reluctant to commit to the goal of high reliability because they regard it as unrealistic or unachievable or a distraction from their current serious fiscal and regulatory pressures . 
 one of the important roles for policymakers and stakeholders is to encourage  persuade  and demand that health care organizations embark on this journey . even after they have committed to do so  how long it will take for health care organizations to reach high reliability is unknown  because none has arrived at that destination yet . 
 cincinnati children 's hospital medical center has been working toward this goal for a more than a decade  and its current strategic plan calls for eliminating serious patient harm by 2015 ( cincinnati children 's hospital medical center 2013 ) . 
 finally  hospitals and systems like memorial hermann and cincinnati children 's that have been trailblazers in striving for high - reliability health care have developed their own strategies and tools  largely through trial and error . 
 for this movement to broaden and deepen  the next wave of hospitals and health systems will need proven tools and methods to speed their journey through higher levels of maturity . 
 many stakeholders could contribute to the development and evaluation of such tools  and policymakers at several levels of government could facilitate this process by focused funding efforts . 
 table 2 depicts the six components of leadership and each one 's characteristics in the four stages of maturity . 
 the six components are the board of trustees  the chief executive officer and all senior management ( including nursing leaders )  the engagement of physicians  the hospital 's quality strategy  its use and dissemination of data on measures of quality  and the use of information technology to support quality and safety improvement . 
 the identification of these specific components is supported by published literature linking them to better quality performance ( goeschel  wachter  and pronovost 2010 ; jha and epstein 2010 ; weiner  shortell  and alexander 1997 ) . 
 the hospital leaders commitment to high reliability must include a prominent role for the board of trustees or directors . 
 the board must be part of the leadership 's commitment to eventually achieve zero patient harm and to elevate quality and patient safety to the organization 's highest strategic goal . 
 if the board is left out  management will find its efforts unsupported or misunderstood . 
 today  hospital boards vary over a wide spectrum of involvement in the quality programs of the hospitals they oversee ( jha and epstein 2010 ) . 
 leadership and high reliability : stages of organizational maturity in addition  physicians are essential to the success of any quality initiative in hospitals . 
 table 2 identifies two vital components of physicians role : leadership and participation . in order to move effectively toward high reliability 
 both the formally appointed leaders ( chief medical officer  vice president for medical affairs ) and the informal leaders ( medical staff president  voluntary medical staff leaders ) need to be visible and active enthusiasts for quality  including physician leaders who are not employees of the hospital . 
 it is difficult to imagine a hospital getting close to high reliability if quality is merely one of many competing priorities . 
 memorial hermann health system  a twelve - hospital health care system based in houston  has explicitly committed to becoming highly reliable and has specified the importance of all the major ingredients in this framework to their efforts ( shabot et al . 
  the system 's ceo pointed out   ensuring patient safety is our core value  and it 's our only core value 
 ( wolterman and shabot 2012 ) . to accelerate the progress toward zero harm  quality must be measured and data on those measures must be widely available both within the hospital and to the public . 
 not only is such transparency valuable in its own right  but public reporting also is a powerful added force that drives improvement . 
 the quality program and its measures should focus on meeting the needs and addressing the specific quality problems of the hospital 's patient population . 
 other incentives  such as the judicious use of financial rewards and staff advancement opportunities based on performance against quality measures  are important accelerants as well . 
 finally  leaders are obligated to employ health information technology ( it ) effectively in the service of quality improvement . 
 it is particularly important to an hro  because it is frequently the vehicle by which nearly perfect processes sustain their performance . 
 if a process has been so effectively redesigned as to be highly reliable  automating it is the most effective way to maintain it in that state . 
 unfortunately  in health care  automation is often deployed unsafely  a phenomenon that increases rather than decreases the risk of harm ( ash et al . 
 2007  2009 ; joint commission 2008b ; koppel et al . 2005 ; sparnon and marella 2012 ) . 
 in addition  various types of health it are often not coordinated  thereby increasing risk . for example  if programmable infusion devices are not supported by the same decision support rules that govern pharmacy systems and physician order entry systems  the resulting confusion can be life threatening for patients . 
 a hospital approaching high reliability adopts health it solutions in a coordinated and integrated manner following the principles of safe adoption ( joint commission 2008b ; karsh 2004 ) .

Abstract: Despite efforts to improve healthcare, preventable harm still occurs and hospitals struggle to sustain improvement. Adapting high-reliability science from industries like aviation offers potential for hospitals to achieve excellence. Framework with 14 components developed to assess readiness and progress towards high reliability.
 
Research and Discussion: Literature and experts in high-reliability industries used to develop framework for hospitals. Direct application of high-reliability practices not feasible for current healthcare systems. Incremental changes necessary for progress towards high reliability, including leadership commitment, safety culture, and effective process improvement tools. 

Results and Conclusion: Hospitals can make significant strides towards high reliability by implementing specific organizational changes. Further research needed to test and confirm effectiveness of framework. High reliability in healthcare is attainable and has potential to greatly improve patient safety."
"acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( agep ) is a rare acute reaction that is drug - induced in 90% of the cases  characterized by a widespread  sterile pustular rash . 
 cefepime is a fourth generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat febrile neutropenia  severe infections related to the urinary tract  skin  nosocomial pneumonia  brain abscess  and intra - abdominal and septic lateral / cavernous sinus thrombosis . 
 a 67-year - old man with renal failure who had been on dialysis during the last 2 years and with an 8-year history of cardiac insufficiency was admitted to the hospital complaining of 6 days of diarrhea . 
 the patient was taken to the semi - intensive care unit and treated with ciprofloxacin . as a consequence  
 his long - term medications had not been changed and consisted of acetylsalicylic acid  furosemide  captopril  carvedilol and clonazepam . on the seventh day  the patient became dyspneic and his chest radiograph showed a left lower lobe opacity . 
 treatment for nosocomial pneumonia was promptly initiated with cefepime ( 1 g / day ) . 
 five days later  he presented with a pruritic  erythematous  maculopapular eruption affecting the abdomen  neck and skin folds . 
 one day later  he developed disseminated pustular lesions ( fig . 1 ) and his temperature was 37c . 
 laboratory exams evidenced c - reactive protein 136 mg / l  white blood cells 14700 cells/l ( normal 350010500 cells/l ) with 11995 cells/l neutrophils ( normal 17008000 cells/l ) . 
 histology showed a toxic pustuloderma with spongiform subcorneal pustules  edema in the papillary dermis and perivascular inflammatory infiltrate consisting of neutrophils ( fig . 
 after withdrawal of cefepime and introduction of imipenem  the disseminated skin nonfollicular pustules cleared within 4 days following a desquamation . 
 the patient denied previous adverse reaction to other drugs and no personal or family history of psoriasis was evident . 
 agep is a disease characterized by the rapid onset of many sterile  nonfollicular pustules usually arising on an edematous erythema and frequently accompanied by leukocytosis and fever . 
 skin symptoms usually arise rapidly after an insult and resolve spontaneously ( within a few days ) . 
 agep often starts predominantly in intertriginous areas or on the face  spreading rapidly to the trunk and lower limbs . 
 the mean duration of the pustules is 9.7 days  and an annular desquamation typically follows for a few days . 
 complications are rare [ 1  3 ] . the agep validation score of the euroscar study group has been used to establish the diagnosis . a score between 8 and 12 for agep is a definitive diagnosis ( table 1 ) . 
 the case score was 11  according to the validation score of the euroscar study group ( table 2 ) . 
 the main differential diagnosis of agep is pustular psoriasis . because the pustules clinically and histologically resemble the lesions of pustular psoriasis and because in a number of reports patients had a history of plaque psoriasis  some authors assume that agep is nothing more than an acute exacerbation of psoriasis caused by a variety of exogenous triggers 
 however  many studies strongly suggest that agep is not associated with psoriasis [ 1  5 ] . up to now 
 agep has been attributed to a variety of causes such as viral infections  chlamydia pneumoniae infection   or hypersensitivity to mercury  but the skin reaction is primarily an adverse response to drugs 
 . antibiotics  other than cefepime  have been implicated as the causative agents in 80% of individuals . in this group  
 the present case of agep has well defined criteria  and because correct diagnosis generally leads to spontaneous resolution once the causative drug is withdrawn  clinicians should keep the possibility of this cutaneous drug reaction in mind .","!

1) ABSTRACT: A 67-year-old man developed acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) after initiation of cefepime treatment for nosocomial pneumonia. This rare cutaneous rash is often caused by adverse drug reactions, with antibiotics being the main culprit. Prompt recognition and withdrawal of the offending drug is crucial for successful management.

2) RESEARCH AND DISCUSSION: AGEP is a disease primarily caused by adverse drug reactions, with cephalosporins being implicated in a small percentage of cases. In this instance, the patient's skin biopsy showed characteristic features of AGEP, supporting the diagnosis. Immediate cessation of the offending drug led to resolution of symptoms, emphasizing the importance of identifying and withdrawing any potential trigger.

3) RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The patient's AGEP rapidly resolved following withdrawal of cefepime, further implicating the medication as the cause. This case serves as a reminder to consider AGEP in any patient presenting with acute pustular rashes, particularly when on antibiotic therapy. Early recognition and prompt discontinuation of the offending drug are key to successful management and preventing potential complications."
"paediatric age at the time of diagnosis represents a negative prognostic factor for keratoconus progression  with increased probability of corneal transplant . 
 particularly younger patients represent a population at high risk for more rapid progression of the disease [ 1  2 ] . 
 the long - term results reported in literature [ 35 ] have demonstrated the ability of cross - linking to slow the progression of keratoconus by a photo - polymerization reaction of stromal collagen fibres . 
 cross - linking photodynamic reaction is induced by the combined action of a photosensitizing substance ( riboflavina o vitamin b2 ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) a light  allowing a corneal stiffening by increasing the number of intrafibrillar  interfibrillar covalent bonds  and corneal collagen resistance against enzymatic degradation [ 68 ] . 
 the long - term effects of the technique are related also to a process of collagen neosynthesis with a different structure and higher molecular weight [ 912 ] which confers to the corneal stroma an increased resistance and lamellar compaction responsible of the variable functional modifications recorded after the treatment [ 1114 ] .   according to international results [ 35 ]  
 cross - linking should be the primary choice in young patient with   progressive keratoconus . 
 to report a comparative prospective long - term functional analysis after cross - linking in three different age groups ( 18 years  between 1926 years  and   27 years ) of patients affected by progressive keratoconus . 
 since 2004 to date more than 610 patients were treated by combined riboflavin uv a corneal collagen cross - linking . 
 present prospective nonrandomized open study comprised 516 eyes of 413 patients aged between 10 and 40 years  affected by progressive keratoconus . 
 the comparative functional analysis comprised the following :   paediatric group ( 18 years and under ) included 152 eyes of 105 patients ( 29.5% )  intermediate group ( 1926 years ) included 286 eyes of 243 patients ( 55.4% )  adult group ( 27 years ) included 78 eyes of 65 patients ( 15.1% ) . 
 all patients included in the treatment protocol were affected by progressive keratoconus with a documented clinical and instrumental worsening at least in the last three months of observation . 
 the parameters we considered to establish keratoconus progression were worsening of ucva / bscva > 0.50 snellen lines  increase of sph / cyl > 0.50  d  increase of topographic symmetry index 
 sai / si > 0.50  d  increase of maximum k reading > 0.50  d  reduction of the thinnest point at optical pachometry 10  m  clear cornea at biomicroscopic examination  absence of reticular dark striae at confocal laser microscopy in vivo . 
 we considered  significant  for the inclusion in the study the variation of at least 3 of the parameters listed above ( one clinical plus two instrumental ) . 
 statistical analysis was conducted by the mann - whitney u test for nonparametric data ( ucva and bscva ) and by the paired t test for parametric data ( maximum curvature power  symmetry indices and coma values ) . 
 the surgical procedure of corneal cross - linking with riboflavina uva was performed in all patients according to the siena protocol   using the vega cbm ( caporossi - baiocchi - mazzotta ) x linker ( cso  florence  italy ) developed in italy at the department of ophthalmology of siena university by the same authors  under intellectual property of siena university  italy . 
 the treatment was conducted under topical anaesthesia ( 4% lidocaine drops ) . after applying the eyelid speculum  
 a 9  mm diameter marker was used to mark the corneal epithelium in a central circle  then epithelium was removed with a blunt metal spatula . 
 after epithelial scraping  a disposable solution of riboflavin 0.1% and dextrane 20% ( ricrolin sooft  montegiorgio  italy ) was instilled for 10 minutes   of corneal soaking before starting uv a irradiation . 
 the riboflavin and dextrane solution was administered every 2.5 minutes for a total of 30 minutes of uva exposure ( 3  mw / cm ) . 
 treated eyes were dressed with a therapeutic soft contact lens bandage for 4 days and medicated with antibiotics ( ofloxacin drops 4  times / day )  nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( diclofenac drops 4  times / day ) and lachrymal substitutes  until contact lens removal . 
 after therapeutic corneal lens removal  fluorometholone 0.2% drops ( 3  times / day ) and lacrimal substitutes were administered for 6 to 8 weeks .

 according to the literature in   and our previous reports  keratoconus progression is more frequent and faster in younger patients under 18 years old at the time of diagnoses  with higher probability to undergo a corneal transplantation [ 1  3 ] . 
 therefore paediatric patients represent the goal of photo - induced riboflavin uv a corneal collagen cross - linking .   the italian pilot study  siena cxl paediatrics 
  conducted on a large cohort of patients with a long - term follow up  demonstrated that there was a significant and fast functional improvement in younger patients after riboflavin uv a corneal cross - linking . as we recently published  it is however impossible to exactly predict the distribution of cross - links and the geometric redistribution of newly formed collagen [ 12  14 ] . 
 long - term comparative analysis showed that functional results after riboflavin uv a corneal collagen cross - linking among paediatric patients were slightly better  but without statistically significant differences with the results recorded in the intermediate group patients . on the other hand  patients over 27 years showed a positive but poorer functional response compared with other age groups .   the mean kmax   variation and topographic surface asymmetry index results were statistically significant in the paediatric sample  particularly in the postoperative 24 months . 
 after the 24th month  until the 48th month  the mean data results were statistically not significant  reasonably due to reduced number of patients in the longitudinal analysis . 
 the comparative aberrometric data of coma values showed a significant improvement in all analyzed groups  justifying the rapid improvement of visual acuity in all treated patients . in the paediatric group of our cohort 
  there was a minority of patients   ( about 5% ) that  despite the treatment  showed a worsening trend or at least an instability of keratoconus .   in our opinion  this concept 
 should be remarked because the disease in this age group is more aggressive and the possibility of progression higher than in the others age groups . 
 the instability of certain cases should be explained by the different genetic patterns of keratoconus [ 1719 ]   with relative biochemical modifications   potentially occurring in corneal stroma associated with negative influences of some environmental factors ( allergy  atopy ) [ 2124 ] . 
 every time we decide to treat a paediatric patient under 18 years affected by progressive keratoconus  parents and patient himself should be well informed about the possibility that the treatment in a minority of cases could not warrant a total and long - lasting stabilization of the disease  with the possibility to repeat the cross - linking or to undergo alternative treatments . 
 pilot study demonstrated the effective ability of corneal cross - linking to retard keratoconus progression in all age groups with better functional response in patients under 26 years . 
 treatment ensured   a long - term keratoconus stabilization in over 90% of treated cases . the lower functional response observed in patients over 27 years 
 plasticity  in the adult age  as well demonstrated in the literature [ 25  26 ] . 
 cross - linking treatment may result in less effectiveness with increased failure and complication rate particularly in adult patients over 35 years  as reported in the literature . according to our long - term comparative age - related analysis and results 
  the standard riboflavin uv a cross - linking with epithelium removal should be the first choice therapy of progressive keratoconus in paediatric and under-26-year old patients with corneal thickness at least of 400  m in the thinnest point .","

1) Abstract: This study reports on the long-term functional analysis of riboflavin UV cross-linking (CXL) in three different age groups of patients with progressive keratoconus (KC). Results demonstrated significant improvement in visual acuity and corneal topography after CXL, providing stable results in over 90% of patients.

2) Research and Discussion: The study included 516 eyes from three age groups, with CXL performed using the Siena protocol and the Vega CBM X linker. Post-operative examinations at 48 months showed significant gains in visual acuity and reduction in Kmax and coma values. These findings suggest that CXL is an effective long-term treatment for progressive KC, especially in pediatric patients.

3) Results and Conclusion: Analysis of the data revealed a mean gain in UCVA and BSCVA for all age groups, as well as a significant reduction in Kmax and coma values. This confirms the success of riboflavin UV CXL in stabilizing progressive KC in over 90% of patients, making it the recommended treatment for this condition, particularly for younger patients under 26 years of age. Further studies are needed for confirming these results.

"rufinamide ( ruf ) is a triazole derivative that is structurally unrelated to other antiepileptic drugs ( aed).1 it was approved by the united states  food and drug administration ( fda ) in 2004 for the treatment of lennox - gastaut syndrome ( lgs ) in patients aged 4 years and older.2 ruf was authorized for the same indication in europe in january 2007.23 the mechanism of action involves limiting the firing of excessive sodium - dependent action potentials.1 ruf has been reported to reduce the number of drop attacks and major motor seizure in about 60% of patients with lgs and has subsequently been regarded as an effective adjunctive therapeutic agent.2 in recent years  studies have been reported that ruf is also efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of various epilepsy syndromes other than lgs  including cases of refractory epilepsy in pediatric patients.3 however  there are still limited data regarding the long term treatment results of ruf for pediatric refractory epilepsy . 
 the aim of this study was to delineate the long term efficacy and tolerability of ruf in children and infants with intractable epilepsies . 
 we performed a retrospective study for the patients who met the following inclusion criteria ; ( 1 ) who were followed up for more than one year at samsung medical center since the beginning of the ruf use  at the time of 31 aug 2011  ( 2 ) who were less than 19 years of age at the time of the start of ruf treatment  ( 3 ) who were classified as intractable epilepsy  meaning presence of persistent seizures despite the use of more than three antiepileptic drugs  and ( 4 ) whose data on the clinical characteristics and seizure outcome were available . 
 the data concerning demography  clinical characteristics  seizure - related characteristics  laboratory works including electroencephalography ( eeg ) and brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri )  and treatment outcome were collected . 
 we conformed to the classification of the international league against epilepsy ( ilae ) in 1981 and 1989 in classifying the seizure and epilepsy of the patients.45 the efficacy of ruf was evaluated by the response rate  by comparing the seizure frequencies at the baseline and in the last three months . 
 patients who showed seizure reduction of more than 50% in frequency was defined as responders . 
 the retention rate was another index of efficacy and was defined by the portion of patients who continued with ruf treatment for one year . 
 tolerability was evaluated by the presence of side effects . additionally  we investigated the influencing factors for the response rate or retention rate .

 ruf has established its efficacy in lgs and has been approved as an adjunctive treatment for patients older than four years of age with lgs.6 in previous studies  ruf was also efficacious and well tolerated in treatment of various epilepsy syndromes other than lgs  including cases of refractory epilepsy in pediatric patients.3 however  the data about the efficacy of ruf in epilepsies other than lgs are limited.37 in this study  ruf showed a response rate of 21.6% in patients with lgs  intractable ge or lre . 
 the retention rate at one year was 54% and a fourth of the patients showed various adverse effects . 
 the response rate of ruf in patients with refractory epilepsies including lgs was reported to be 26.746.7%.1378 those studies included both child and adult patients and the mean age ranged from 1 to 50 years . according to the study of kluger et al7 which was conducted in 60 patients ( 45 children and 15 adults ) treated with ruf over the mean period of 14.5 months with inadequately controlled epilepsy syndromes ( range : 318 months )  the overall response rate was 26.7% . in another study  
 the patients with refractory epilepsies showed the response rate of 46% at 21 weeks of ruf therapy.8 this study included pediatric patients with lgs or other intractable epilepsy and the mean age of the patients was 9.5 years in the range of 120 years . 
 the response rate of the present study was 21.6% and it is slightly lower than previous studies mentioned above . 
 this difference may result from the intractability of study population including the patients with lgs and highly intractable generalized epilepsy and localization related epilepsy . at the time of introduction of ruf 
  the patients had taken a mean 7.2 ( range : 413 ) aeds  which was much higher than the studies of kluger et al . and 
 joseph et al.78 in our study  patients with lgs showed a slightly higher response rate of 30% than patients with other intractable ge or lre . 
 in one prospective study with 43 patients with lgs  the overall response rate of ruf at 12 months was 60.5% without worsening of seizures.2 in another study involving children and young adults with lgs  the response rate was 54.8%.3 in those studies  patients with lgs took a large part of the total number of patients compared to our study group . due to such reason  response rate in other studies were higher than the present study . 
 however  ruf was found to be more efficacious in patients with lgs than those with intractable ge or lre . as for seizure types  
 the highest response rate was shown in atonic seizure ( 27.8% ) . according to previous data  atonic seizure and tonic seizure 
 were the most improved types of seizure by ruf as adjunctive therapy ( 63.6% and 48.6%  respectively).19 also  in a long - term  open - label extension study  124 patients with lgs ( aged 437 years ) were treated with ruf for a median of 432 days . during the treatment  47.9% of patients had 50% reduction in the frequency of tonic - atonic seizures.6 based on previous studies  ruf appeared to be an effective adjunctive therapy for intractable atonic seizures . in our study  
 partial seizure responded equally to ruf  and a similar result was reported in other studies.37 retention rate is known as an indicator for evaluating both efficacy and adverse effects.10 according to one previous study  the retention rate of ruf at 14.5 months was 41.7%7 which is consistent with the present study . in this study  the reasons for retention varied and 60% of them were non - responders ( less than 50% in seizure reduction ) . 
 the reasons for retention in those non - responders were as follows : excellent initial response  definite cognitive improvement by parent s record and ruf being more effective than other previous aeds . 
 coppola et al1 reported early effectiveness of ruf in refractory childhood epileptic encephalopathy patients with or without vpa . 
 similarly  in our study  seven patients showed a good initial response to ruf during titration . in our study  two patients reported noticeable improvement in cognitive function even though seizure reduction was less than 50% . 
 one study suggested that ruf has a favorable cognitive profile  increasing its appropriateness for many patients  especially those with cognitive impairment . 
 their cognitive ability was rather improved in the seizure free - state and no worsening had been reported.11 in our study  27% of patients reported a mild to moderate degree of adverse effects . 
 the most commonly observed adverse events were insomnia ( n=3 )  loss of appetite ( n=3 ) somnolence ( n=2 )  irritability ( n=2 )  vomiting and dizziness . 
 none of previous studies have reported life - threatening adverse effects.378 the previous studies reported that vomiting and drowsiness were major symptoms of adverse effects.312 in our study  most adverse events  such as insomnia and loss of appetite  were mild to moderate in severity . 
 children with lgs and other intractable epilepsy syndromes showed 21.6% response rate and 54% retention rate during ruf treatment . also  27% of children showed adverse effects of ruf and 10.8% children stopped ruf due to adverse effects . 
 the present data suggest that ruf provides good efficacy and tolerability in pediatric patients with refractory generalized or localization related epilepsy syndromes as well as lgs .","

Abstract: This retrospective observation study aimed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide (ruf), a novel antiepileptic drug, in 37 pediatric patients with intractable epilepsies and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) over a 12-month period. The response rate was 21.6% with 5.4% of patients achieving seizure freedom, and the retention rate was 54%. Adverse effects, mostly insomnia and somnolence, were reported in a few patients. 

Research and Discussion: The study found that rufinamide may be an effective and safe option as an adjunctive treatment for pediatric patients with intractable epilepsies, including LGS. Despite an overall low response rate, a significant number of patients experienced some benefit from rufinamide. However, the most common reason for discontinuation was ineffectiveness, indicating the need for further research to identify potential predictors of response. 

Results and Conclusion: The study concluded that rufinamide may be considered an efficacious and safe antiepileptic drug for pediatric patients with intractable epilepsies and LGS. Despite a low response rate, the retention rate was relatively high, suggesting the tolerability of rufinamide in this population. Further studies are needed to better understand the factors affecting response to rufinamide and its long-term efficacy in pediatric intractable epilepsies."
"cluster headache is a form of primary neurovascular headache  which consists of unilateral head pain that occurs in association with cranial autonomic features and  in most patients  has a striking circannual and circadian periodicity . 
 excruciating painful attacks are accompanied by restlessness or agitation  usually last less than 3  h  and occur in bouts for a few months during which the patient has one or more crisis per day . 
 the international headache society defines cluster headache as attacks of severe  strictly unilateral pain which is orbital  supraorbital and temporal or in any combination of these sites  lasting for 15180  min and occurring from once every other day to 8 times a day . 
 the attacks are associated with one or more of the following  all of which are ipsilateral : conjunctival injection  lacrimation  nasal congestion  rhinorrhoea  forehead and facial sweating  miosis  ptosis  eyelid oedema . 
 epidemiological data for the general population are scarce ; only five studies have been carried out until now on cluster headache prevalence in the general population  with conflicting results ( prevalence rates vary between 56 and 326 cases in every 100000 inhabitants ) . a recent study on a sample representative of the italian general population aged over 14  years  reported an estimated prevalence rate of 279/100000 ( 95% ci : 173427 )  227/100000 ( 95% ci : 104431 ) in women and 338/100000 ( 95% ci : 175592 ) in men . 
 cataract is clouding ( opacity ) of the lens of the eye that causes a progressive  painless loss of vision . the first symptom of cataract is usually blurred vision . 
 other symptoms that may progressively appear are : glare  halos  double vision and perception of colours as more yellow and less vibrant . 
 three different types of cataract can be identified on a histological basis : nuclear  cortical and posterior subcapsular . 
 investigations [ 58 ] on possible risk factors for the development of cataract  showed positive correlation with myopia  diabetes  smoking [ 911 ]  use of systemic corticosteroids  exposition to uv - b  and other environmental factors  to which has to be added genetic predisposition . 
 however  it should be underlined that different degrees of correlation between distinct risk factors and the three types of cataract have been reported [ 6  15 ] . 
 prevalence studies of age - related cataracts are hampered by the absence of a uniform grading system for cataract opacities  by differing definitions of visual impairment  and by additional coexisting ocular pathologies causing loss of vision . 
 nonetheless  the framingham eye study   in 1977 reported that the proportion of people with age - related cataracts causing loss of vision of 20/30 ( 6/9 ) or worse was 15.5% for all ages and 45.9% for those older than 75  years . in the beaver dam eye study   in 1992  using a similar definition of loss of vision reported proportions were 38.8% for men and 45.9% for women 
 older than 74  years . however  it is not clear if variations in frequency reflect methodological diversity or true differences between populations . 
 interestingly  most of the cited studies analyzed the cataract prevalence in age groups which are substantially different from those of our two cases . 
 one single study reported the prevalence of cataract at a younger age ( 40  years and older )   with identified risk factors for the three different histological types of cataract . 
 this study showed age - specific rates of the different histological cataract type  by stratifying the population sample by age . 
 prevalence of 1% ( cortical type )  of 0.2% ( nuclear type ) and of 2.0% ( posterior subcapsular ) was reported in individuals between 40 and 49  years and a prevalence of 3.9% ( cortical type ) of 0.2% ( nuclear type ) and of 2.6% ( posterior subcapsular ) was reported in individuals between 50 and 59  years . here 
  we report two cases that both developed cataract before the age of 50  years on the side affected from the cluster headache and reviewed published similar cases and potential mechanisms for comorbidity . 
 we present a 44-year - old man with a history of cluster headache  diagnosed in accordance with ihs guidelines  since he was 21  years old . 
 daily pain attacks  lasting about 90  min  were localized to the left periorbital area with ipsilateral lacrimation and rinorrhea . 
 the cluster headache that initially occurred sporadically  from the age of 43  years became chronic . 
 at the age of 39  the patient was diagnosed of cataract on the left eye that was in the same year treated by surgery . 
 the sole risk factor for developing cataract at anamnesis was smoking habit ( 30 cigarettes / day ) . a detailed pharmacological anamnesis excluded any kind of exposure to prolonged treatment with steroid drugs . 
 the second case was a 53-year - old man who experienced his first cluster headache episode when he was 44  years old . 
 cluster periods were characterized by 34 attack / day of severe right - sided pain localized to the periorbital region  lasting about 45  min and associated to ipsilateral lacrimation . 
 the reported risk factor for developing cataract was smoking habit ( 10 cigarettes / day ) . 
 also in this case  there was no report of chronic treatment with steroid drugs . 
 references were identified by searches of pubmed from 1966 until october 2007 with the terms  cluster headache  and  cataract  . 
 our search in pubmed shows only one report of a patient with cluster - like headache  which began after surgical removal of the crystalline for cataract and intraocular lens implant . 
 therefore  to our knowledge  this is the first report of cataract occurring in cluster headache patients and  interestingly  on the same eye affected by the pain attack . 
 it is of interest that both patients developed cataract in a young age  after suffering for years from chronic cluster headache attacks and in the absence of main risk factors for the development of early onset cataract  including prolonged steroid drugs exposure . 
 it is noteworthy that the two patients  although not relative  had the same  rather uncommon  last name that we found to be specifically represented in a defined area of north - eastern italy . 
 however  because we could not investigate the pedigree of one patient  any hypothetical genetic link between the uncommon occurrence of early onset cataract and cluster headache can not be proposed . 
 in addition  it was not possible to perform in either of the two patients any investigation on ocular inflammation . 
 thus  no speculation can be made on a possible causal relationship between repeated episodes of pain  inflammation and autonomic abnormalities that are considered to contribute to the cluster headache attack  and the precocious occurrence of the cataract . 
 however  this first evidence of the occurrence of cataract in relatively young adult men with a history of chronic cluster headache is of importance  because underlining this uncommon type of comorbidity may favour the report of additional similar cases .","

1) Abstract: The relationship between cluster headaches (CH) and cataracts is explored in two case studies of men with the same last name and from the same region of Italy. Both developed cataracts on the same side as their pain attacks after years of suffering from chronic CH.

2) Research and Discussion: The two case studies highlight a potential association between CH and cataracts, with the latter developing on the same side as the pain attacks. This suggests that there may be shared underlying mechanisms between the two conditions. Further research is needed to better understand this possible link and potential treatment implications.

3) Results and Conclusion: Both patients in the case studies developed cataracts on the side affected by CH, with one experiencing it 18 years after the onset of CH and the other after 8 years of chronic CH. This is the first report of cataracts in patients with CH, indicating a potential connection between the two conditions. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings and explore potential treatment options."
"obesity is not only a risk factor for cancer development but also a factor affecting treatment outcomes . 
 endometrial cancer ( ec ) was the first malignancy to be recognized as related to obesity . 
 it has been associated with lower quality of life values among ec survivors and higher body mass index ( bmi )  measured before ec diagnosis  has been associated with higher all - cause and endometrial cancer  specific mortality . 
 early stage ec treatment involves surgery ( total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo - oopherectomy with or without pelvic lymph node dissection ) followed by adjuvant radiotherapy in selected cases . 
 randomized studies have shown that radiotherapy ( rt ) reduces the risk of pelvic relapse . 
 vaginal cuff is the most common site of relapse and the postoperative radiation therapy for endometrial carcinoma 2 ( portec-2 ) trial demonstrated that patients with intermediate - risk ec can be treated safely with postoperative vaginal cuff brachytherapy ( vcb ) in the absence of whole pelvic external beam radiotherapy  thus decreasing toxicity . 
 although vcb is one most commonly used adjuvant gynaecological treatments  there is a lack of studies analysing whether dosimetric factors are influenced by overweight . 
 our aim  therefore  was to evaluate the effect of bmi and perivaginal fat on dose in organs at risk during fractionated vcb . 
 retrospective analysis of 220 consecutive brachytherapy fractions derived from 59 patients who underwent postoperative vcb for gynecological cancer was conducted . 
 fiftysix patients underwent vcb due to endometrial cancer and three patients due to cervical cancer . 
 twenty - six endometrial cancer patients underwent postoperative vcb alone using six fractions ; the remaining patients were treated with whole pelvis external beam radiotherapy ( wprt ) followed by three or four vcb fractions ( 15 patients underwent each fractionation ) . 
 patients were assessed weekly during treatment and every 4 or 6 months afterwards according to the clinical stage . 
 brachytherapy was performed with the largest diameter cylinder that could fit comfortably into the vaginal vault ; and the cylinders were positioned to remain parallel to the cranio - caudal axis of the patient . 
 no instructions were given prior to the vcb procedure apart from the need to evacuate prior to coming to the hospital . 
 all patients underwent a ct planning scan at every application  with 2-mm thick slice at 2-mm overlapping intervals in the supine position using a foley bladder catheter instilling dilute contrast medium ( 5 ml of omnipaque350 [ ge healthcare bio - sciences  madrid  spain ] into 45 ml of saline solution ) in order to increase bladder visibility during segmentation and volume reproducibility during treatment . 
 cts were transferred to a 3d treatment planning system ( oncentra v.4.1  nucletron  an elekta company  elekta ab  stockholm  sweden ) . to improve comparisons  the same physician re - contoured and re - planned every image set under the same conditions for an iridium-192 remote afterloading unit ( microhdr nucletron  nucletron  an elekta company )  regardless of the treatment administered . 
 the entire bladder volume was delineated  and the rectum was defined from 1 cm above the cylinder tip to 1.5 cm below the last activated source dwell position . 
 an active length of 2.5 cm was used to deliver a fraction dose of 5 gy at 5 mm depth to the vaginal surface . 
 d0.1cc  d1cc  and d2cc for bladder and rectum were assessed from dvhs for each fraction . 
 the angle of the vaginal cylinder applicator related to the horizontal plane parallel to the craneo - caudal patient axis was calculated  positive values indicating a tip directed to the bladder and negative values indicating a posterior displacement of the cylinder tip toward the rectum . cylinder size and rectum and bladder volumes were also noted . 
 the bmi formula was weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres . 
 categories were underweight < 18.5 kg / m ; normal 18.5 - 24.9 kg / mm ; overweight 25.0 - 29.9 kg / mm ; obese i 30.0 - 34.9 kg / mm ; obese ii 35.0 - 39.9 kg / mm ; and obese iii > 40.0 kg / mm . 
 we considered fat that was confined within the 100% isodose on the first ct planning scan as the perivaginal fat . 
 it was segmented by thresholding on the hounsfield units ( hu ; 190 to 30 hu ) and the volume was recorded . 
 perivaginal fat analysis was performed only in the first ct planning scan because the most common practice for vcb is to perform only one ct and to translate this plan to the next fractions . 
 patient mean dose - volume metrics  volumes  and cylinder angle were calculated from the different fractions . 
 chi - square tests  kruskal - wallis analysis  and univariate regression analysis were performed . 
 a stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to model organs at risk ( oars ) dvh parameters as a function of other variables ( the significance levels for addition to and removal from the model were set at 0.05 and 0.10  respectively ) .

 a stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to model organs at risk ( oars ) dvh parameters as a function of other variables ( the significance levels for addition to and removal from the model were set at 0.05 and 0.10  respectively ) . 
 a mean of 3.7 vcb fractions per patient were retrieved . according to the who bmi classification  
 6.8% of patients were classified as normal  35.6% as overweight  and 57.6% as obese i. there were no severely obese patients ( class ii or iii ) . 
 the median age ( iqr ) and bmi for the overall group was 64.3 years ( 18.4 ) and 32 years ( 9.5 )  respectively . 
 median bmi values for every who classification were 22  27.8  and 36.6 for normal - weight  overweight  and obese i patients  respectively . 
 patients were significantly older as the bmi class increased ( kruskal - wallis test  p=0.043 ) . 
 the fact that obese patients were treated with larger cylinder applicators ( 82.4% ) than patients in the normal range ( 25% ) ( chi - square test  p=0.037 ) is significant . a positive  significant correlation was observed between bmi and perivaginal fat volume ( r=0.556  p=0.001 ) ( fig . 
 bmi also showed positive correlation with age ( r=0.272  p=0.037 ) and negative correlation with the bladder dvh metrics ( d0.1cc  r=0.366  p=0.004 ; d1cc  r=0.454  p=0.001 ; d2cc  r= 0.451  p < 0.001 ) 
 a low positive correlation was observed between the perivaginal fat volume and cylinder angle ( r=0.288  p=0.027 )  vaginal cylinders tilted towards the bladder as perivaginal fat volume increased ( fig . 
 2 ) . univariate regression showed no significant association between bladder dose metrics and cylinder angle . 
 multivariate regression was performed to determine the effect of variables analysed on the bladder dvh metrics ( table 3 ) . 
 age of patients and the use of a 3.5 cm cylinder diameter showed significance for d2cc . 
 when a reanalysis was performed  replacing bmi with perivaginal fat volume  models were unable to retain the perivaginal fat volume among the predictors . 
 patients developed grade 1 or 2 acute toxicity  no higher acute toxicity levels were observed . 
 late toxicity was uncommon  only one patient developed g3 bladder toxicity and two patients developed late rectal toxicity  one of them g1 and the other g2 . 
 the main finding from this study is that higher bmi values showed an association with lower bladder dose parameters but not with rectal dose . 
 adipose tissues are commonly classified as subcutaneous or visceral fat  the latter being associated with metabolic disease . 
 visceral fat located in the periprostatic area has been associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness and its volume showed direct correlation with bmi . a reduction in rectal doses among patients with higher bmi during prostate brachytherapy 
 this dose reduction is considered to be a result of the inverse square law due to the increase in fatty tissue at the prostate - rectum interface . 
 our results  from an analysis of a large sample and a high number of brachytherapy insertions  confirm those of a recent study that reported higher bladder doses in women with lower bmi during vcb . 
 a positive  significant correlation was observed between bmi and perivaginal fat volume ( r=0.5561  p=0.001 ) ( fig . 
 unfortunately  due to the limited field of view ( fov ) used during ct scan acquisition  we were unable to determine whether correlation existed with visceral fat . 
 the small fov left some part of the visceral fat outside the scanning area precluding this analysis . 
 our results do not support an increase in perivaginal fat or application of the inverse square law as the main cause of lower doses in oars  due to the inability of perivaginal fat to remain in the multivariate regression models . if that was the main explanation  rectal doses would also decrease with higher perivaginal fat volumes . 
 obesity class i patients are strongly associated ( hazard ratio  3.93 ) with ec  but no association with stage or grade of disease was found in the large women s health initiative study . 
 the relative risk of death from cancer among women with a bmi of 32 or higher was 2.1 compared with the risk for women with bmi < 19 . 
 although obesity is described as a risk factor for adverse outcomes after treatment for many malignancies  the effect of bmi on ec treatment outcomes has been a subject of debate . 
 while analysis of the national institutes of health - aarp diet and health study demonstrated an increased risk of overall and disease - specific mortality among women with higher pre - diagnosed bmi  the analysis of the gog 99 study data associated obesity with higher mortality from causes other than ec but not disease recurrence . 
 the analysis of the astec trial failed to find an association of bmi with a reduced post - treatment survival . 
 a recent systematic review did not suggest an association between bmi and the recurrence of cancer . 
 vaginal brachytherapy ( vbt ) has been one of the main adjuvant treatments for ec since the results of randomized trials that showed vbt was not inferior to pelvic irradiation in high intermediate risk patients  and its use is extended after external beam radiotherapy in high risk patients . 
 there have been concerns regarding the methods for delivery of vbt  whether to use a single plan approach or a customized plan at every fraction . 
 the first approach requires some level of homogeneity between insertions because several variables can affect dose deposition to oars [ 17 - 20 ] . 
 our data are not influenced by bladder filling due to the routinely placed bladder catheter . 
 perivaginal fat volume was associated with an anterior cylinder tilt which  paradoxically  did not go with higher bladder dose ; therefore  we believe that anatomical visceral fat distribution could be the cause of differences in bladder dose according to bmi ( fig . 
 a limitation of our study is the lack of a complete pelvic visceral fat segmentation  which was not possible due to the limited pelvic volume scanned in some insertions . 
 strong correlation was observed between perivaginal fat volume  which was used as a surrogate for visceral fat volume  and bmi . 
 this measure has not been validated  abdominal adiposity at the umbilicus level being the usual measure of visceral and subcutaneous fat . to study these relationships 
 the fact that there were no severe or extremely obese patients ( bmi obese class ii and iii ) in this report is noteworthy  and reflects the bmi distribution among the general population in mediterranean countries compared with the population in the united states . 
 in addition  the population attributable fraction is greater for the us population ( 56.8% ) than for the european population ( 45.2% ) . 
 population differences in bmi obese classes ii or iii could modify these results . although the study did not focus on clinical results  we believe that is important to know  as much as possible  which variables influence the absorbed doses to organs at risk 
 . this knowledge is more important in a clinical setting where only the first vbt application is planned and the remaining are assumed to be similar due to a fixed geometry  according to the american brachytherapy society consensus . 
 in conclusion  the results reported in this study demonstrate a significant inverse correlation between bmi and bladder dose deposition during vcb . 
 the impact of these findings on late toxicity needs to be evaluated in clinical practice .",".

1) Abstract: This study aimed to analyze the relationship between BMI and doses in organs at risk during postoperative vaginal cuff brachytherapy (VCB) treatment. A retrospective analysis of 220 planning CT sets showed that BMI was significantly associated with lower bladder dose values in Mediterranean, overweight, and moderately obese patients.

2) Research and Discussion: The mean values for bladder and rectal dose metrics were extracted and evaluated from 220 planning CT sets in 59 patients. The results showed a significant association between BMI and lower bladder doses, but not with rectal doses. Multiple regression analysis revealed that BMI was retained in the models for bladder dose parameters.

3) Results and Conclusion: The study found a significant association between BMI and lower bladder doses during postoperative VCB treatment. However, there was no significant correlation between BMI and rectal doses. This suggests the potential for personalized dose optimization in overweight and obese patients undergoing VCB treatment."
"hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) is an important risk factor for developing hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) ( 1 ) . 
 hcc is the fifth most common cancer worldwide  and it causes significant public health problems  especially in association with chronic hepatitis b ( 2 ) . 
 morphologic lesions during hepatocarcinogenesis include dysplastic lesions ( dysplastic foci ( df ) and dysplastic nodules ( dns ) ) with low- and high - grade dysplasia and small cancerous lesions ( 2 cm in diameter ; early hcc ) ( 4 - 7 ) . 
 the most common cause of cirrhosis in shiraz transplant center  which is the largest liver transplant center in the country  is hbv related  and majority of patients with hcc in this center are also hbv related ( 1 ) . 
 therefore  we attempted to determine the incidence of hcc and its precursors in this group of cirrhotic patients through a thorough examination of explanted hbv - related cirrhotic livers . 
 a two - year cross - sectional study was performed on 103 explanted hbv - related cirrhotic livers from the pathology department of shiraz university of medical sciences . during the study period ( 2014 - 2015 )  explanted cirrhotic hbv - related livers ( recipient cirrhotic liver after liver transplantation ) received in the department of pathology were fixed in formalin for 24 - 48 hours . 
 histologic sections from any hepatic nodule larger than 1 cm in diameter or those with any kind of difference with background parenchyma  such as color or consistency  were studied ( figures 1 and 2 ) . 
 sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin method  and slides were examined under a double - headed microscope by two pathologists . 
 df were classified into having either small cell changes ( scc )  formerly called small cell dysplasia  or large cell changes ( lcc )  formerly called large cell dysplasia . 
 nodules were studied and classified as low - grade dysplastic nodules ( lgdn )  high - grade dysplastic nodules ( hgdn )  and hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) ( 5 ) . 
 the following criteria were used to classify the different nodules in cirrhotic livers : cellularity  thickness of hepatocellular plates  nuclear atypia ( either pleomorphism or irregular contour )  nucleocytoplasmatic ratio  cytoplasmic staining ( eosinophilic  basophilic  amphophilic  and clear )  pseudoacinar pattern  stromal invasion  portal tracts  biliary pigment  lipid vacuoles  and iron status of nodules ( 8) . in lgdn  hepatocytes are not completely abnormal . 
 that is  they show normal or slightly increased nucleocytoplasmic ( n / c ) ratio  minimal nuclear atypia  and no mitotic activity  but portal tracts are still present . compared with lgdn  
 hgdn have all of their features except the n / c ratio is higher  nuclear atypia is more obvious  cytoplasmic basophilia is more significant  and liver plates ( more than two cells thick ) are thickened with mitotic figures . in hcc  cell size 
 is usually decreased  nuclear density is at least twice that of normal  nuclear atypia is definite  mitotic figures are present  and pseudoacinar formation may be present ( 9 ) . 
 the term   early hcc mean hcc in an early stage that are small in size ( usually < 2 cm ) . 
 histologically  hcc are well differentiated and lack prominent cellular and structural atypia ( 10 - 13 ) . for convenience 
  we used the term advanced hcc ( ahcc ) for hccs that are greater than 2 cm in size in this article . 
 the chi - square test was used to evaluate the significance of the relation between the nodules and their categorical variables . 
 a total of 103 patients were included in the study . among the patients  14 ( 13.16% ) were women  89 ( 86.4% ) were men  age ranged from 20 to 73  and mean age was 51.4  10.5 . among all explanted cirrhotic livers  
 92 ( 89.3% ) had df with lcc  57 ( 55.3% ) of which showed scc as well . out of these 103 explanted livers  39 ( 37.9% ) had lgdn  38 ( 36.9% ) had hgdn  19 ( 18.4% ) had early hepatocellular carcinoma ( ehcc )  and 21 ( 20.4% ) had ahcc ( figures 3 - 6 ) . 
 note that all the cases with ehcc and ahcc also had scc  lcc  hgdn  and lgdn . 
 thirteen cases of ehcc were accompanied with ahcc  and 6 cases of ehcc did not show any ahcc ( size larger than 2 cm ) . 
 all of the 21 ahcc cases were transplanted with the preoperative diagnosis of malignancy and hepatitis b - related cirrhosis . however  among livers with ehcc  6 were not accompanied with ahcc  2 of which were unsuspected before surgery and diagnosed on the explanted liver . 
 the two ahcc cases were smaller than 2 cm in diameter ( table 1 ) . 
 our results showed that the presence of scc  lgdn  and hgdn has a statistically significant association with ehcc ( p < 0.05 ) and hcc ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 moreover  the presence of ehcc is associated with ahcc ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 hcc is a poor prognostic cancer  and it is one of the most common causes of cancer death around the globe . 
 hcc is also common in countries with high incidence of hbv - related cirrhosis ( 1 ) . despite the improvements in treatment modalities for hcc  the survival rate remains low even after liver transplantation because hcc can not be easily diagnosed before the advanced stage ( 14 ) . 
 therefore  studies on the incidence and diagnosis of precancerous lesions of hcc are important  especially for patients who develop hcc secondary to hbv infection and cirrhosis . 
 therefore  pathologists and clinicians should be able to diagnose ahccs and ehccs from their precursor lesions using various techniques preoperatively ( 10 ) . 
 hepatic precancerous lesions are currently divided into two categories depending on cytological and histological changes : microscopic df and macroscopic dns ( 11 ) . 
 df can be recognized only in microscopic examination as they are smaller than 1 mm . 
 dns are recognizable both in gross examination of hepatic specimens and in microscopic examination as well - defined nodule lesions that are different from the background cirrhotic liver tissue in size  color  texture  or degree of bulging on the cut surface . 
 hccs can be either ehcc ( less than 2 cm ) or ahcc ( larger than 2 cm ) ( 8  9 ) . globally  
 hbv is the most common cause of cirrhosis and hcc in iran ( 12 ) . in this study 
  we attempted to identify the true prevalence of hcc and its precursors in 103 explanted livers through thorough sectioning of at least 15 sections for each liver after precise inspection of the gross specimens . among all 103 
 explanted cirrhotic livers in our study  92 ( 89.3% ) had df with lcc . 
 according to this result  lcc is a common finding in cirrhotic livers of patients with chronic hepatitis b  but it does not seem to be associated with any malignant lesion  thus confirming the lack of premalignant potential in theses lesions . 
 that is  some studies similar to our own found that lcc ( formerly called lcd ) had no histogenetic association with hcc ( 13 ) . 
 others concluded that lcc in relation to hbv might not only be an innocent bystander but might be closely related to hepatocarcinogenesis ( 15 ) . 
 it can be diagnosed by the presence of clusters of hepatocytes with a small size  minimal nuclear atypia  high n / c ratio  and high nuclear crowding . 
 the report by plentz et al . indicated that severely decreased expression of p16 and p21  telomere shortening  and accumulation of dna damage in scc and hcc compared with lcc and cirrhotic nodules were all suggestive of the malignant potential of scc compared with lcc ( 17 ) . in our study of 103 patients with hepatitis b - associated liver cirrhosis  57 ( 55.3% ) had scc . out of these 57 livers with scc  19 ( 70.4% ) had ehcc and 21 ( 36.8% ) had hcc . 
 our results showed that the presence of scc is associated with ehcc ( p < 0.05 ) and hcc ( p < 0.05).therefore  scc may be associated with the presence of ehcc or hcc . according to our results  a thorough sampling is advised for every patient with scc to detect any malignant lesion . 
 for example  in one study  scc was proved to be associated with aneuploidy and elevated dna index  and it was found to be a moderate - to - high risk for progression to hcc ( 18 ) . among the 103 explanted livers  39 ( 37.9% ) had lgn  38 ( 36.9% ) had hgdn  19 ( 18.4% ) had ehcc  and 21 ( 20.4% ) had ahcc . 
 thus  70% and 53% of the cases with lgdn and 50% and 55% of the cases with hgdn showed ehcc and hcc  respectively . 
 this association was statistically significant ( p value < 0.05 ) . according to previous studies  lgdn and hgdn are indicators of increased risk of hcc in cirrhotic livers . 
 hcc nodules are commonly seen within dns ( i.e.  nodule - within - nodule pattern ) ( 14 ) . in conclusion  
 scc  lgdn  and hgdn seem to be common associated findings and precursors of hcc in livers infected with hepatitis b. a strict follow - up and a precise and thorough sampling and sectioning of livers with scc and any abnormal dns  especially those larger than 1 cm  are highly recommended because of their association with malignancy .","

Abstract:
Hepatitis B is the most common cause of liver transplantation in Iran, and it is also a major cause of liver cancer. This study examined the incidence of liver cancer and its precursors in people with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis in Iran's largest liver transplant center.

Research and Discussion:
The study found that dysplastic lesions and small cancerous lesions were common in those with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis. Furthermore, it emphasized the importance of closely monitoring and thoroughly examining any abnormalities in these individuals, as they were strongly associated with the development of liver cancer.

Results and Conclusion:
The majority of the examined cirrhotic livers showed dysplastic foci and various degrees of precursors to liver cancer, including small and large cell changes, dysplastic nodules, and early hepatocellular carcinoma. This highlights the need for strict follow-up and thorough sampling of these individuals, especially those with dysplastic nodules larger than 1 cm, to ensure early detection and treatment of potential malignancy."
"dry eye disease ( ded ) continues to present clinicians with a diagnostic dilemma  primarily due to its multiple causative factors . as a result of the disease s complexity 
  there is currently no test or set of tests considered a  gold standard  for its diagnosis and monitoring . without such a diagnostic standard of care  
 however  a recent study showed that 43% of asymptomatic patients had clinical signs of dry eyes.1 if left untreated  ded can significantly impact a person s vision and quality of life . a diagnostic tool that can globally diagnose ded  regardless of the cause  may be valuable in helping physicians establish an earlier and more accurate dry eye diagnosis . based on the definition from the dry eye workshop ( dews ) in 2007  
 ded is defined as follows : 
 dry eye is a multifactorial disease [   .. ] that results in symptoms of discomfort  visual disturbance  and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface . 
 it is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface.2 dry eye is a multifactorial disease [   .. ] that results in symptoms of discomfort  visual disturbance  and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface . 
 it is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface.2 as can be seen from the definition  the symptoms are likely non - specific  and ocular surface damage may actually be a late complication . 
 the dews identified increased tear osmolarity and tear film instability as  core mechanisms  of ded  regardless of the etiology.2 tests that accurately measure tear osmolarity and tear film instability should therefore  theoretically be best for identifying and determining the severity of ded . 
 tear osmolarity is attractive  because it offers an objective numerical output that can be monitored ; other commonly used diagnostic tests rely heavily on subjective grading criteria . in the past  
 the two most commonly used instruments to measure tear osmolarity were the clifton and vapor pressure osmometers . 
 studies have demonstrated their accuracy  high sensitivity and specificity.34 the main downside to these instruments is that they require a significant amount of time and involve numerous steps  increasing the potential for tear evaporation ; as such  they are not practical  especially for dry eye patients with low tear volumes.34 a newer technology produced by tearlab uses a micro - electrode to measure the number of charged particles in a tear sample ; this electrode is designed to avoid direct contact with the ocular surface  thereby reducing the chance for reflex tearing.3 the tearlab measurement method appears as accurate as the more involved osmometers  differing on average by only 2 mosm / l in both normal and dry eye patients.3 the tear - lab device requires only a small tear sample ( ~0.2 l ) and is able to provide results almost instantly  reducing the level of tear evaporation.35 when compared with a vapor pressure osmometer  the tearlab osmolarity system was able to measure more patients with lower volume tear samples.4 compared to the clifton osmometer  the tearlab device was reported to have similar sensitivity but slightly better specificity and positive predictive value.3 the aim of the current review is to establish whether published studies support the use of tear osmolarity testing  primarily using the tearlab device  as a tool for ded diagnosis and treatment monitoring . 
 comments from the literature related to the role of tear osmolarity in the pathophysiology of ded and how ocular or systemic conditions and pharmaceuticals impact tear osmolarity are also discussed . 
 a literature search was conducted using pubmed in june 2014  using the search term  tear osmolarity  to identify all potentially relevant articles to that date . 
 a review of the abstract of each article was used to identify those related or unrelated to tear osmolarity  or to identify those articles where tear osmolarity was not a primary focus of the paper . where there was any doubt  
 the paper was classified as related to tear osmolarity . a more detailed review of the remaining papers related to tear osmolarity 
 tear osmolarity research before the year 2000 was limited in scope  methodology  and applicability . 
 more recent research generally reflects any relevant earlier results  so a decision was made that articles published in the year 1999 or earlier would not be included in the review . 
 discussions of tear osmolarity that did not include a diagnostic component were also eliminated ; while they provide a research basis for the use of osmolarity in evaluating the tear film  diagnostic papers are indicative of the clinical application of this more basic research . 
 a rating of all relevant articles was performed using the grading of recommendations assessment  development and evaluation ( grade ) which is based on the likelihood that further research is required to confirm the significance of reported results6 as well as the university of michigan practice guideline which is based on the study design.7 the grade scoring included consideration of both study sample size and financial interest disclosures in evaluating the  quality  of the evidence . 
 the financial interest categorization was not to suggest that sponsored studies are lower quality than independent research  but only to reflect the potential for bias in reporting results . 
 relevant data were entered into an access database ( microsoft corporation  redmond  wa  usa ) for analysis . 
 an article was rated in the  high  category if it fulfilled both the a criteria in the university of michigan practice guideline and fulfilled the definition in the  high  requirement under the grade system . 
 similarly  b and  moderate   c and  low   as well as d and  very low 
 were used from the university of michigan practice guideline and the grade rating systems  respectively  to identify the rating of the relevant articles . 
 the articles were also subjectively reviewed for the impression they left with the reader  whether  positive    neutral   or 
 table 1 contains the summary of preliminary search data ; a total of 407 articles were listed as potentially relating to tear osmolarity . 
 the results from this preliminary analysis identified 164 papers in the peer - reviewed literature as having some reference to tear osmolarity and its use as a diagnostic tool . 
 of the 164 articles identified as relevant peer - reviewed articles  an impression of the results ( positive / neutral / negative ) was possible for 163 of them ( one foreign language study was excluded ) . 
 all but four of the remaining studies could be graded as well  using the combination of the two grading systems outlined previously . 
 table 2 shows the breakdown of articles by grading and impression . as can be seen  only 32% ( 52/163 ) of the studies available qualified as moderate or high quality ; sample size  a lack of randomization  and the lack of control populations were the primary limiting design factors that led to lower quality ratings for studies . in this subgroup of moderate or high quality articles  73% ( 38/52 ) had a positive impression  17% had a neutral impression  and 10% had a negative impression . 
 this breakdown by impression was similar to that for the studies graded low or very low ( 71% positive  24% neutral  and 5% negative  respectively ) . 
 table 3 summarizes the financial interest breakdown  with a percentage breakdown in each financial interest column . approximately two - thirds of the articles were independent  with the remaining third sponsored ( by tearlab or others ) . 
 the impressions for 93% of the much larger group of independent articles were positive or neutral . 
 while not shown in table 3  the results were independent of study quality ; of the 104 independent studies that were rated  31% ( 32/104 ) had a high or moderate rating  and of those 32 articles  72% ( 23/32 ) were positive  indicating that tear osmolarity was a useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of dry eye and its severity . 
 a further 19% ( 6/32 ) were neutral  while 9% ( 3/32 ) of the articles suggested there was little value to the use of tear osmolarity . 
 the following discussion outlines the results of the literature review based primarily on studies rated as moderate or high . 
 we discuss how tear osmolarity testing is performed  the cut - off value for dry eye diagnosis  the accuracy and repeatability of tear osmolarity testing  and how tear osmolarity compares with other commonly used diagnostic tests . 
 finally  articles discussing the effect of external factors  ocular and/or systemic disease  and pharmaceuticals on tear osmolarity are reviewed . 
 evaluating the diagnostic ability of tear osmolarity requires specifying a value that discriminates a healthy eye from an eye with ded ; this value is known as the threshold value . in the literature  
 tear osmolarity threshold values have varied from 305 mosm / l8 to 316 mosm / l.5 one reported reason for variability in tear osmolarity threshold values is tear film instability  a hallmark characteristic of the disease.910 normal  mild / moderate  and severe dry eyes had average tear osmolarity values of approximately 302+/8 mosm / l  315+/10 
 mosm / l and 336+/022 mosm / l  respectively.1011 another study had lower reported mean values  but the study noted that they included more patients with mild and moderate ded than severe ded.8 it can be seen that the distribution of ded severity in different populations may explain some of the variability in threshold values . 
 studies have demonstrated that tear osmolarity is most influenced by  and correlated with  disease severity.1011 one study found that using a tear osmolarity threshold of 305 mosm / l gave a 98.4% positive predictive value.8 using a tear osmolarity threshold of 316 
 mosm / l to 317 mosm / l  sensitivity varied from 59%12 to 81%13 specificity varied from 78%14 to 94%12 with a positive predictive value of 85%313 a negative predictive value of 74%13 and an overall predictive accuracy of 89%.12 a meta - analysis that used a 316 mosm / l threshold noted that tear osmolarity may be more accurate than lactoplate  the schirmer s test  and rose bengal testing.12 currently  the 316 mosm / l threshold is believed to better discriminate between mild and moderate / severe dry eye  while 308 
 mosm / l is now considered to be a widely accepted threshold.5 a tear osmolarity threshold of 308 mosm / l correctly diagnosed severe dry eye and normal patients 90.7% and 81.3% of the time  respectively ; this value appeared to be the most sensitive for discriminating between normal eyes and those presenting with early stages of ded.10 variability in tear osmolarity can also be a diagnostic indicator ; in one study  variability between the two eyes in normal  mild  or moderate dry eye patients and severe dry eye patients was 6.95.9 
 mosm / l  11.710.9 mosm / l  and 26.522.7 mosm / l  respectively.10 variability in inter - eye measurements and repeat measurements in the same eye appears to increase with the severity of dry eye . 
 mild ded may also manifest as variability with repeat measurement of the same eye or between the two eyes . 
 measured osmolarity is low and stable in those without ded.9 tear osmolarity has been shown to have good repeatability8 in normal subjects  with no significant difference in osmolarity values when using up to four readings taken 1 to15 minutes apart.9 a concern with using osmolarity as a diagnostic test is the observed overlap in measured values between normal and dry eyes ; this has been documented as especially high in two studies.1516 however  in one of these studies15 dry eye patients were being treated with eye drops or systemic medications  which would be expected to lower osmolarity . the second study16 may have suffered from a  selection bias   where other diagnostic tests  but not tear osmolarity  were used to categorize patients into a dry eye and a control group . 
 this categorization may have skewed the results in favor of the tests used in the categorization process.16 different studies have suggested that tear osmolarity does not provide a sharp diagnostic cut - off  but rather can serve as a guide to indicate disease severity or progression.810 while tear osmolarity testing is beneficial at providing a numerical value to the current state of dry eyes  other complementary diagnostic tests are valuable in discriminating the etiology of the disease.10 when compared with schirmer s test results  meibomian gland grading  ocular surface disease index ( osdi )  tear break - up time ( tbut )  corneal and conjunctival staining  tear osmolarity was better at predicting dry eye severity ; as tear osmolarity increased  dry eye severity also increased in a largely linear pattern.811 another study also demonstrated that tear osmolarity had higher sensitivity when compared with corneal staining  conjunctival staining  and meibomian grading  and better specificity when compared with tbut and schirmer s test results.10 the higher the severity of ded  the greater the correlation between tear osmolarity and other diagnostic tests;8 this result may indicate that other diagnostic tests are less sensitive to mild ded diagnosis . 
 given the intermittency of disease severity in the mild dry eye patient  the performance of all diagnostic tests will be more variable in this population segment . 
 for instance  meibomian gland dysfunction may not increase tear osmolarity  as demonstrated in one study.17 one explanation for this is that meibomian gland dysfunction alone may not be sufficient at overwhelming the homeostatic control in most patients . examining all such studies in the present review  
 there is an indication that osmolarity is correlated with some other diagnostic tests  but the correlation is less apparent when looking only at those studies rated moderate quality or higher . 
 one factor here is that the general correlation between objective tests and subjective tests for dry eye is poor.1 this issue is likely due to the multiple etiologies and presentations of ded ; when particular tests are specific to one etiology  then there may be a lack of overall correlation.1 like other diagnostic signs  tear osmolarity may not correlate with symptoms in a general population18 although it has been shown to correlate over time with effective therapy  as described in the  pharmacological effects and treatment  section of the present review . 
 dry eye symptoms can be non - specific or can be a result of a psychiatric disorder such as depression or post - traumatic stress disorder ; both of these conditions increased dry eye symptoms but were not associated with other dry eye signs such as increased c - reactive protein or tear osmolarity.19 one study9 found that for the majority ( 92%  or 23/25 ) of patients  when the patient was symptomatic  his or her maximum tear osmolarity was > 308 
 mosm / l  and when the patient was asymptomatic  his or her maximum tear osmolarity was < 308 mosm / l . in the same study9 a minority of patients ( 8%  or 2/25 ) had increased tear osmolarity and no symptoms or low tear osmolarity and symptoms ; this result may be due to them having only mild ded in the former case  and low osmolarity due to a condition other than ded in the latter case . 
 this study9 concluded that increased tear osmolarity is likely a precursor for dry eye complaints  despite the lack of correlation between tear osmolarity and dry eye symptoms . 
 certain factors  diseases  or drugs have been noted to be associated with ded and increased tear osmolarity . 
 it is likely that not all patients exposed to the same external factors  diseases  or drugs will have dry eyes or increased tear osmolarity . 
 such reactions will be a function of the individual s response to these stresses and whether or not their eyes are able to adjust . 
 the effect of external factors such as humidity on tear osmolarity is not clear . in one study  
 subjects exposed to low relative humidity of 20% for 10 minutes.20 another study found that exposure to humidity of 5% for 2 hours did not increase or result in more variability in tear osmolarity.21 both studies included subjects who were using artificial tears before the study  although they discontinued use more than 1 hour in advance of testing . 
 one study did not specify the type of artificial tear used  and the other did not state the airflow velocity . 
 such differences may account for the conflicting results.2021 in addition  the use of less sensitive diagnostic tests may have resulted in the inclusion of some mild dry eye patients in the normal group  which would have further confounded results . 
 the literature is divided over whether or not contact lens wear increases22223 or has no effect on tear osmolarity.102425 where osmolarity was measured in some of these studies1024 there was an appropriate delay between contact lens removal and osmolarity measurement . 
 the differences in reported results are likely a function of the wearer s ability to maintain homeostasis of their tear film  overcoming the drying effect of contact lenses.10 it appears that certain procedures may influence tear osmolarity more than others . 
 in a recent 2013 article  no change in tear osmolarity or any other dry eye diagnostic test was observed after refractive surgery  despite a decrease in corneal sensitivity.26 after cataract surgery  tear osmolarity has been noted to increase.27 the difference here may be explained by the subjects ages ; average age was 26 years in the refractive surgery study26 and 71 years in the cataract surgery study.27 older patients may take longer to recover from surgically induced ocular trauma.27 trabeculectomy surgery performed on a patient population with an average age of 71 years also had higher tear osmolarity than a control group ; this result was attributed to the presence of the bleb  the use of mitomycin c ( which may cause epithelial damage )  or the residual effects of long - term use of glaucoma medications before surgery.28 no difference in tear osmolarity was noted between the eye that underwent eyelid reconstruction surgery and the un - operated eye of the same patient ; this result may be related with corrective tearing  as evidenced by the higher schirmer s test results in the operated eye.29 table 4 shows studies that investigated the effect of various ocular and systemic conditions on tear osmolarity . 
 of the systemic conditions  diabetes was found to increase tear osmolarity.3031 an increase in tear osmolarity was correlated with an increase in diabetes duration . 
 the relation between diabetes and increased tear osmolarity is most likely due to a decrease in the amount of aqueous secretion as a result of injury to the lacrimal gland  the small blood vessels of the lacrimal gland  and/or the corneal nerve.31 thyroid disease that results in an increase in palpebral aperture and proptosis has also been reported to significantly increases tear osmolarity when compared to a control.32 increased pain sensation  as evident in patients with fibromyalgia  was related to increased tear osmolarity.33 traumatic brain injury patients had higher tear osmolarity values than a healthy control group.34 patients with increased tear osmolarity may also be dehydrated  so water intake may be an important consideration for dry eye diagnosis and treatment.35 an increase in estrogen and/or progesterone ( in the form of birth control pills)25 or the excess of androgens ( as noted in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome)36 seemed to have no effect on tear osmolarity . 
 another study found that low levels of 17-beta estradiol  estrone  and testosterone were associated with increased tear osmolarity ; treatment with phytoestrogen decreased tear osmolarity when compared to a control group.37 more studies in this area appear warranted to further understand the correlation between sex hormones and tear osmolarity ; adequate control of hydration or measurement of hydration status may be important in such studies . 
 different ocular conditions also seem to have different effects on tear osmolarity ( table 4 ) . 
 for instance  eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome  a condition that is thought to alter goblet cell activity and mucin production  have been reported to have increased tear osmolarity when compared to a control group.38 patients with pterygia  a predominantly inflammatory condition  also show increased tear osmolarity when compared with a control group.39 keratoconus has been demonstrated to reduce corneal sensitivity  but tear osmolarity was similar to a control group . 
 the reason for this similarity is not clear  though it may be that keratoconus is not generally clinically considered an inflammatory disease.40 herpetic keratitis was associated with higher tear osmolarity in both the affected and unaffected eyes when compared to a control group ; the reason the unaffected eye had higher tear osmolarity may be due to the type of keratitis.41 patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction are likely to compensate by decreasing tear production  resulting in a tear osmolarity value similar to a control group.42 table 5 summarizes the findings of different studies on the effect of certain drugs on tear osmolarity . the use of oral mucolytics  often to treat respiratory conditions  increases tear osmolarity . 
 this increase is most likely due to alterations to the mucin layer of the tear film.43 glaucoma medications increased tear osmolarity  perhaps due to the preservatives  while such medications did not have a significant effect on tbut or schirmer s test results.28 artificial tears have been noted by several studies to decrease tear osmolarity204445 but one study found no correlation between tear osmolarity and the use of artificial tears.16 the latter study did not disclose the type of artificial tear used . 
 this may be an important factor  because the type of eye drop can impact tear osmolarity.45 for instance  lower osmolarity eye drops have been associated with lower tear osmolarity.4647 it has been noted that the decrease in osmolarity observed with the use of artificial tears may be comparable to the effects of heat and massage application to the eyelids using a thermal massager.44 the effect of anti - inflammatory medication on tear osmolarity is less clear  especially because the studies evaluating this effect suffer from limitations such as small sample size and the lack of a control group or randomization.4850 in one recent randomized  double - blind  parallel study in finland  osmolarity was observed to increase through the dry winter months.51 participants taking oral sea buckthorn oil  containing n-3 and n-6 fatty acids and antioxidants  had less of an increase in tear osmolarity when compared to a control group  presumed to have been a function of the oil s anti - inflammatory mechanism.51 
 evaluating the diagnostic ability of tear osmolarity requires specifying a value that discriminates a healthy eye from an eye with ded ; this value is known as the threshold value . in the literature  
 tear osmolarity threshold values have varied from 305 mosm / l8 to 316 mosm / l.5 one reported reason for variability in tear osmolarity threshold values is tear film instability  a hallmark characteristic of the disease.910 normal  mild / moderate  and severe dry eyes had average tear osmolarity values of approximately 302+/8 mosm / l  315+/10 mosm / l and 336+/022 mosm / l  respectively.1011 another study had lower reported mean values  but the study noted that they included more patients with mild and moderate ded than severe ded.8 it can be seen that the distribution of ded severity in different populations may explain some of the variability in threshold values .

 mosm / l to 317 mosm / l  sensitivity varied from 59%12 to 81%13 specificity varied from 78%14 to 94%12 with a positive predictive value of 85%313 a negative predictive value of 74%13 and an overall predictive accuracy of 89%.12 a meta - analysis that used a 316 mosm / l threshold noted that tear osmolarity may be more accurate than lactoplate  the schirmer s test  and rose bengal testing.12 currently  the 316 mosm / l threshold is believed to better discriminate between mild and moderate / severe dry eye  while 308

 mosm / l  11.710.9 mosm / l  and 26.522.7 mosm / l  respectively.10 variability in inter - eye measurements and repeat measurements in the same eye appears to increase with the severity of dry eye . 
 mild ded may also manifest as variability with repeat measurement of the same eye or between the two eyes .

 no change in tear osmolarity or any other dry eye diagnostic test was observed after refractive surgery  despite a decrease in corneal sensitivity.26 after cataract surgery  tear osmolarity has been noted to increase.27 the difference here may be explained by the subjects ages ; average age was 26 years in the refractive surgery study26 and 71 years in the cataract surgery study.27 older patients may take longer to recover from surgically induced ocular trauma.27 trabeculectomy surgery performed on a patient population with an average age of 71 years also had higher tear osmolarity than a control group ; this result was attributed to the presence of the bleb  the use of mitomycin c ( which may cause epithelial damage )  or the residual effects of long - term use of glaucoma medications before surgery.28 no difference in tear osmolarity was noted between the eye that underwent eyelid reconstruction surgery and the un - operated eye of the same patient ; this result may be related with corrective tearing  as evidenced by the higher schirmer s test results in the operated eye.29 
 the effect of external factors such as humidity on tear osmolarity is not clear . in one study  
 subjects exposed to low relative humidity of 20% for 10 minutes.20 another study found that exposure to humidity of 5% for 2 hours did not increase or result in more variability in tear osmolarity.21 both studies included subjects who were using artificial tears before the study  although they discontinued use more than 1 hour in advance of testing . 
 one study did not specify the type of artificial tear used  and the other did not state the airflow velocity . 
 such differences may account for the conflicting results.2021 in addition  the use of less sensitive diagnostic tests may have resulted in the inclusion of some mild dry eye patients in the normal group  which would have further confounded results .

 table 4 shows studies that investigated the effect of various ocular and systemic conditions on tear osmolarity . of the systemic conditions  
 diabetes was found to increase tear osmolarity.3031 an increase in tear osmolarity was correlated with an increase in diabetes duration . 
 the relation between diabetes and increased tear osmolarity is most likely due to a decrease in the amount of aqueous secretion as a result of injury to the lacrimal gland  the small blood vessels of the lacrimal gland  and/or the corneal nerve.31 thyroid disease that results in an increase in palpebral aperture and proptosis has also been reported to significantly increases tear osmolarity when compared to a control.32 increased pain sensation  as evident in patients with fibromyalgia  was related to increased tear osmolarity.33 traumatic brain injury patients had higher tear osmolarity values than a healthy control group.34 patients with increased tear osmolarity may also be dehydrated  so water intake may be an important consideration for dry eye diagnosis and treatment.35 an increase in estrogen and/or progesterone ( in the form of birth control pills)25 or the excess of androgens ( as noted in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome)36 seemed to have no effect on tear osmolarity . 
 another study found that low levels of 17-beta estradiol  estrone  and testosterone were associated with increased tear osmolarity ; treatment with phytoestrogen decreased tear osmolarity when compared to a control group.37 more studies in this area appear warranted to further understand the correlation between sex hormones and tear osmolarity ; adequate control of hydration or measurement of hydration status may be important in such studies . 
 different ocular conditions also seem to have different effects on tear osmolarity ( table 4 ) . 
 for instance  eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome  a condition that is thought to alter goblet cell activity and mucin production  have been reported to have increased tear osmolarity when compared to a control group.38 patients with pterygia  a predominantly inflammatory condition  also show increased tear osmolarity when compared with a control group.39 keratoconus has been demonstrated to reduce corneal sensitivity  but tear osmolarity was similar to a control group . 
 the reason for this similarity is not clear  though it may be that keratoconus is not generally clinically considered an inflammatory disease.40 herpetic keratitis was associated with higher tear osmolarity in both the affected and unaffected eyes when compared to a control group ; the reason the unaffected eye had higher tear osmolarity may be due to the type of keratitis.41 patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction are likely to compensate by decreasing tear production  resulting in a tear osmolarity value similar to a control group.42 
 table 5 summarizes the findings of different studies on the effect of certain drugs on tear osmolarity . 
 the use of oral mucolytics  often to treat respiratory conditions  increases tear osmolarity . 
 this increase is most likely due to alterations to the mucin layer of the tear film.43 glaucoma medications increased tear osmolarity  perhaps due to the preservatives  while such medications did not have a significant effect on tbut or schirmer s test results.28 artificial tears have been noted by several studies to decrease tear osmolarity204445 but one study found no correlation between tear osmolarity and the use of artificial tears.16 the latter study did not disclose the type of artificial tear used . 
 this may be an important factor  because the type of eye drop can impact tear osmolarity.45 for instance  lower osmolarity eye drops have been associated with lower tear osmolarity.4647 it has been noted that the decrease in osmolarity observed with the use of artificial tears may be comparable to the effects of heat and massage application to the eyelids using a thermal massager.44 the effect of anti - inflammatory medication on tear osmolarity is less clear  especially because the studies evaluating this effect suffer from limitations such as small sample size and the lack of a control group or randomization.4850 in one recent randomized  double - blind  parallel study in finland  osmolarity was observed to increase through the dry winter months.51 participants taking oral sea buckthorn oil  containing n-3 and n-6 fatty acids and antioxidants  had less of an increase in tear osmolarity when compared to a control group  presumed to have been a function of the oil s anti - inflammatory mechanism.51 
 a systematic review of 164 peer - reviewed articles related to the diagnostic value of tear osmolarity found that 72% of them have a positive impression of the value of tear osmolarity as a diagnostic tool for ded . 
 these results were largely independent of financial interest and article quality rating . there were not as many studies graded high or moderate as might be expected in a review of the literature of this type . 
 it is worth noting that the grading systems used in the current review are typically applied to therapeutic trials where a gold standard control often exists . 
 dry eye is a multifactorial disease with no clear gold standard diagnostic test  so randomized masked trials and comparisons to a relevant control are more difficult to design . 
 performing tear osmolarity testing in a clinical setting appears to be more feasible with the availability of new instruments such as the tearlab osmolarity system . 
 reflex tearing is not a concern when tear osmolarity is collected as per the label instructions.359 test results have been shown to be repeatable and accurate  with good sensitivity and specificity . 
 they appear to be better than other commonly used diagnostic tests  especially in the early stages of the disease.8101213 correlations between different diagnostic tests remain an issue  but the lack of correlation is not surprising given the multi - factorial nature of ded and the fact that different diagnostic tests reveal different aspects of the disease.1 the seemingly inconsistent threshold values reported in the literature may be a reflection of the disease s characteristic of tear film instability 
 . it may also be due to the difference in disease severity of the tested groups  given the strong correlation between tear osmolarity and disease severity.911 the more severe the ded  the higher the threshold and the greater the variability in the tear osmolarity value.9 the currently agreed - upon value that discriminates between healthy and dry eyes is when the higher tear film osmolarity value of the two eyes is 308 mosm / l.510 as with any diagnostic tool  interpretation must be based on the complete clinical picture  including other diagnostic tests that might be helpful in determining the dry eye etiology.10 certain commonly encountered external factors such as contact lens wear may or may not increase tear osmolarity  depending on the individual response.224 the impact of environmental factors  such as temperature  humidity  and airflow on tear osmolarity appears unclear  as is the effect of sex hormones ; these factors would benefit from further investigation.2021253637 the effect of ocular surgery on tear osmolarity may be partially dependent on the patient s age  the type of surgery performed  and the ability of the eye to recover.2629 systemic conditions commonly believed to result in dry eye  such as dehydration  diabetes  and thyroid ophthalmopathy  have been shown to increase tear osmolarity  as expected.313235 ocular conditions  such as herpetic keratitis  pterygia  and pseudoexfoliation syndrome  have also been demonstrated to increase tear osmolarity.383941 keratoconus  largely viewed clinically as a non - inflammatory condition  was not associated with increased tear osmolarity.40 some pharmaceuticals  such as mucin - altering drugs and glaucoma medications  appear to increase tear osmolarity  while others  such as artificial tears  likely lower tear osmolarity.202843 research into the effect of anti - inflammatory medications on tear osmolarity has produced varied results ; the topic deserves further investigation.484951 there are limitations in any review of this nature  and consequently to any of our comments related to the factors associated with osmolarity . by confining the review to  tear osmolarity   
 related discussions of some of the dry eye issues ( such as the effect of hormones ) in some papers will have been missed . 
 additionally  in limiting the review to more recent papers  some of the foundational work in this field has been omitted . 
 in summary  the findings in the articles evaluated in the present review appear to confirm the central role of increased tear osmolarity in the pathophysiology of ded  as described by the dews.2 the majority of the studies reviewed here  and more specifically those rated as moderate or high quality  support the use of tear osmolarity as a tool to diagnose  grade severity  and track therapeutic response in ded .",".


Abstract: This literature review evaluates the use of tear osmolarity as a physiological marker for diagnosing and managing dry eye disease (DED). Results show a positive overall impression for its use in diagnosis, grading severity, and tracking therapeutic response, regardless of quality of research or source of financial support.

Research and Discussion: A total of 164 relevant articles were identified, with 159 graded and 163 providing an overall impression for tear osmolarity. The majority (72%) of articles supported its use in DED diagnosis, with a neutral impression in 21% and negative in 7%. Impressions were similar regardless of research quality or source of financial support.

Results and Conclusion: The literature widely supports the use of tear osmolarity as an objective measure for DED diagnosis, severity grading, and treatment monitoring. Of the graded articles, 72% had a positive impression and support was independent of research quality or financial support. Tear osmolarity appears to be a valuable tool in managing DED."
"anemia  which can be defined as hemoglobin less than 13 g / dl or hematocrit less than 36%  is a relatively common preoperative finding . 
 approximately one third of patients are anemic before they undergo joint arthroplasty  with baseline hemoglobin levels between 10 and 13 g / dl . in veterans undergoing noncardiac surgery  
 the incidence of preoperative anemia ( hematocrit < 36% ) was 34%  and in surgical patients who refused transfusions because of religious reasons  28% had preoperative hemoglobin levels less than 12 g / dl . 
 the incidence of anemia also increases with age . in a recent study of 296 elderly patients with hip fractures  the mean hemoglobin on hospital admission was 12.1  1.7 g / dl . 
 anemia is especially prevalent in patients with cancer  and treatment plans often include surgery . 
 a low initial hemoglobin level measured at disease presentation is a risk factor for further development of anemia throughout the course of treatment . in patients with colorectal cancer 
 following radical mastectomy for breast cancer  38% of women were anemic ( hemoglobin < 12 g / dl ) before their first chemotherapy cycle  and 59% became anemic after surgery and chemotherapy . ensuring adequate tissue oxygenation in the surgical setting frequently involves the administration of blood transfusions . 
 patients with preoperative hemoglobin levels between 10 and 13 g / dl may be three or more times as likely to receive allogeneic blood than those with baseline hemoglobin greater than 14 g / dl . although it has been documented that patients prefer to receive autologous blood  those who are anemic before surgery are not candidates for preoperative autologous donation ( pad ) . 
 patients with coronary artery disease have impaired hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic responses to hypoxia  and autologous blood donation is not feasible because the hemodilution that ensues may not be tolerated . 
 endogenous erythropoietin normally stimulates the bone marrow to increase red blood cell ( rbc ) mass under hypoxic conditions  but if this nonhemodynamic response to hypoxia is impaired then hemoglobin levels do not rebound sufficiently . 
 if hemoglobin levels fall even further during surgery due to blood losses  as commonly occurs  the likelihood of receiving an allogeneic blood transfusion increases . 
 rbc transfusions are associated with an increased risk for postoperative infections   and tumor recurrence  as well as with a variety of immunologic complications   that may adversely affect surgical patients . 
 longer hospital stays and higher health care costs have also been linked to blood transfusions . 
 although allogeneic blood is now reportedly safer than ever  safety issues with the blood supply still exist . furthermore  blood is a scarce resource that is becoming even more so . as the ' baby boomer ' population ages  two factors are converging that will limit blood availability and drive up its cost . 
 first  the eligible donor pool is shrinking and  second  surgery in these patients  whether elective or otherwise  is on the increase . because of these quality - of - care and economic factors 
  the decision to transfuse should be carefully weighed by all members of the surgical team  and transfusion alternatives considered . 
 the importance of correcting preoperative anemia can not be overemphasized because this condition is known to be associated with poor outcomes after surgery . 
 coronary artery disease patients with anemia exhibit higher mortality rates and experience more cardiac  abdominal  and renal complications after cardiac or noncardiac surgery than do patients with normal hemoglobin levels . 
 myocardial ischemia is one of the major complications that occur in anemic patients without overt cardiac disease . in elderly men undergoing radical prostatectomy  st - segment changes and postoperative ischemic episodes 
 were seen more frequently in those with lower hematocrit . in another study of noncardiac surgical patients of various types comprising a large veterans administration database  perioperative 
 anemia and blood transfusions were associated with an increased risk for infection  higher mortality rates  and substantial consumption of health care resources . 
 dunne and coworkers   recently documented a relationship between preoperative anemia and stage of colorectal cancer at diagnosis  and a study of 198 patients with rectal cancer   showed that low preoperative hemoglobin levels were an independent risk factor for mortality ( p < 0.0001 ) . taken together  these reports indicate that preoperative anemia is prevalent  that anemia and blood transfusions are associated with risks and poor outcomes  and that anemia should be treated  preferably with strategies that exclude allogeneic blood . 
 the human recombinant form of endogenous erythropoietin ( rhuepo ; epoetin alfa ) is indicated for the treatment of anemic patients who are scheduled to undergo elective surgery ( noncardiac and nonvascular ) to reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusions . 
 multiple clinical studies involving many different surgical types have shown that preoperative rhuepo is safe and effective . 
 patients with initial hematocrits between 33% and 39% and who stand to lose up to 3000 ml blood during surgery are among those who can benefit the most [ 21 - 23 ] . 
 the positive impact of rhuepo is readily apparent in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery  which is often elective and associated with substantial blood losses . 
 oral iron supplementation and treatment with rhuepo should be considered in any anemic patient ( hemoglobin > 10 and  13 g / dl ) whose risk for transfusion is estimated to exceed 10% . 
 patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery who received rhuepo 300 units / kg per day for 10 days preoperatively  on the day of surgery  and 4 days postoperatively had a nearly six - fold reduction in allogeneic transfusion risk as compared with patients who received placebo . 
 in another study that compared rhuepo administered daily ( 300 units / kg per day ) with rhuepo administered weekly ( 600 units / kg per week ) for four doses beginning 21 days before surgery  transfusion requirements were comparable  indicating that the weekly rhuepo regimen also reduces transfusion requirements while improving patient convenience . 
 rhuepo has also been demonstrated to reduce transfusion requirements in elderly patients undergoing major hip or knee reconstruction  in more heterogeneous populations of patients needing total joint arthroplasty or major hip or knee surgery  and even in children requiring craniosynostosis repair . in cardiac surgery  
 all of seven randomized studies included in a meta - analysis   provided evidence that rhuepo  with or without pad  produced significant decreases in the proportion of patients transfused with allogeneic blood . in another single - blind  randomized study of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery  patients treated with low dose ( 100 units / kg ) rhuepo for 4 days before surgery received less than half the amount of autologous blood ( p < 0.01 ) as compared with the control group . 
 surgery in cancer patients represents a particular challenge because these patients may suffer severe anemia caused by their cancer or its treatment . in patients with a hemoglobin under 8.5 g / dl and with colorectal cancer  300 iu / kg rhuepo on day 4 before surgery followed by 150 
 iu / kg for the next 7 days thereafter stimulated erythropoiesis and reduced transfusion requirements compared with placebo . 
 transfusion requirements were reduced and hemoglobin levels were improved with preoperative rhuepo treatment in patients with gastrointestinal tract cancer   and in those with rectal cancer undergoing surgery . 
 other patient groups for whom surgery is indicated and in whom preoperative rhuepo exerts beneficial effects include those with prostate cancer  head and neck cancer  and women undergoing gynecologic surgery for benign conditions . when surgical blood losses are anticipated to exceed 3000 ml  rhuepo is effectively used in conjunction with pad . in patients who were to undergo total hip replacement  rhuepo facilitated dose - dependent increases in pad amounting to 4.3 units ( 300 iu / kg )  3.4 units ( 150 iu / kg )  and 3.0 units ( 75 iu / kg )  as compared with 2.1 units with placebo  and it minimized reductions in hematocrit associated with repeated phlebotomy . 
 treatment with rhuepo resulted in rapid increases in rbc production ( 3.5 days ) in nonanemic ( hematocrit > 39% ) patients who were participating in an aggressive program for autologous blood donation . 
 this treatment allowed for higher rbc volumes to be donated compared with placebo - treated patients . 
 even in anemic gastrointestinal cancer patients  rhuepo facilitated pad compared with patients who were supplemented with iron alone . 
 other examples of the utility of rhuepo in pad before gynecologic surgery   and orthopedic surgery   can be found . although a field of medicine unto itself  the practice of bloodless surgery is gaining attention and therefore deserves brief mention . 
 jehovah 's witnesses refuse transfusions on the basis of religious convictions  but are known to survive trauma and surgery with remarkably low hemoglobin levels . in many cases  these patients do so with the pharmacological support of erythropoietic agents [ 49 - 51 ] . in a case study involving 48 jehovah 's witness patients  
 rhuepo was successfully used to avoid transfusions completely during and after elective coronary and heart valve surgery . when used in combination with products that can substitute for blood   ( 
 e.g. the hemoglobin - based oxygen carriers  also known as hbocs )  there may be complementary effects . 
 thus  patients wishing to avoid transfusions may have even more options in the future . in conclusion 
  preoperative anemia can be effectively managed with minimal exposure to allogeneic transfusions in virtually all surgical specialties . 
 rhuepo reduces transfusion requirements  facilitates collection of preoperative autologous blood  and is effective alone or with other blood conservation strategies in severe anemia . 
 surgeons should enthusiastically adopt available therapies that help to avoid transfusions and their accompanying risks  conserve blood  and treat preoperative anemia  with the goal of improving surgical outcomes .

1) Abstract: Preoperative anemia and allogeneic blood transfusions in surgical patients can lead to poor outcomes. However, studies have shown that preoperative use of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuepo) can stimulate erythropoiesis and reduce the need for transfusions in various surgeries, including orthopedic, cardiac, and cancer procedures.

2) Research and Discussion: Preoperative use of rhuepo, either on its own or in combination with autologous blood donation, has been extensively studied and shown to be effective in reducing the need for allogeneic blood transfusions. This has been observed in various types of surgeries, including orthopedic, cardiac, and cancer procedures, as well as in cases of bloodless surgery.

3) Results and Conclusion: The clinical evidence supports the use of rhuepo as a viable alternative to allogeneic blood transfusions in surgical patients with preoperative anemia. By stimulating erythropoiesis, it can help to avoid or minimize the need for transfusions, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing risks associated with blood transfusions. Further research and consideration of individual patient factors should be taken into account when deciding on the use of rhuepo in preoperative management."
"curcumin17-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxypheny l)- 1- 6- heptadiene- 3  5-dione  commonly known as diferuloylmethane  is the yellow pigment component of the curry or turmeric ( curcuma longa ) ( 1 ) . 
 turmeric extracts have been extensively used for the treatment of several diseases in ayurvedic medicine in india for several centuries . 
 curcumin was first extracted from turmeric in its impure form in 1815  but it was not until 1910 when it was crystallized and its structure was elucidated ( 2 ) . 
 it has antimicrobial  antioxidant  immunomodulatory  anti - inflammatory  anti - alzheimer and anticancer activity ( 38 ) . 
 it has shown no toxicity in vitro in numerous cell culture systems  and in vivo in animal models and over 13 phase i human clinical trials . 
 it is generally recognized as safe by the united states food and drug administration ( fda ) ( 2  4  5 ) . 
 curcumin has been shown to affect several targets in somatic cells for its biological activity ( 38 ) . 
 it inhibits nf-b activity  cox-2  and 5-lox expression and modulates release of several cytokines ( 3  4 ) . 
 it also binds to a number of other proteins including thioredoxin reductase  protein kinases and several receptors ( 3  4 ) 
 . however  most of these proteins / factors may not be expressed/ present in terminally non - transcriptional sperm . 
 also  the sperm has a unique characteristic  the motility  that is not present in other cells . 
 thus  curcumin may have different molecules/ mechanism(s ) for its action that are unique to sperm . 
 recently  our laboratory reported  for the first time ever  that the curcumin affects sperm function ( motility / capacitation and acrosome reaction / fertilization ) in vitro and fertility in vivo . 
 intravaginal administration of curcumin caused a significant  but reversible reduction in fertility ( 9 ) . 
 the molecular mechanism(s ) by which curcumin inhibits / blocks sperm motility has not been delineated . since modulation of intracellular ph ( phi ) and plasma membrane polarization has been shown to be involved in sperm motility and capacitation / acrosome reaction of several mammalian species ( 1021 )  the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of curcumin on sperm intracellular ph and plasma membrane polarization . 
 it was hypothesized that the curcumin - mediated effect on sperm motility is caused by modulation of phi and/or membrane polarization . 
 the long - term objective of the study was to understand the molecular mechanism(s ) by which curcumin affects sperm motility and function and to develop a novel non - steroidal contraceptive with spermicidal properties . 
 semen was liquefied and analyzed for volume  sperm concentration and percent and progressive motility . only those semen samples that had sperm concentration of > 50x10sperm / ml  percent motility of > 60%  progressive motility of > + 3 ( on a scale of 0 to + 5 )  and contamination of immature germ cells and immune cells of < 
 1% were used to collect a pure swim - up sperm population ( 22 ) . 
 the study was approved by the west virginia university - institutional review board ( irb ) for human studies . 
 mouse sperm were collected from cauda epididymis and vas deferens of mature balb / c or cd-1 males . 
 motile sperm were isolated by the swim - up procedure and washed by centrifugation ( 500 g  10 min ) with ham 's f-10 medium supplemented with human serum albumin ( 5 mg / ml ) or modified sperm washing medium ( irvine scientific  santa ana  ca  usa ) . 
 the study was approved by the west virginia university - animal care and use committee ( acuc ) for animal studies . 
 # c27727 ) was obtained from sigma - aldrich ( st . louis  mo  usa ) . 
 curcumin was dissolved in dimethylsulf - oxide ( dmso ) ( 25 - 50 mm stock ) and then diluted in medium to the desired concentrations . 
 the effect of curcumin on sperm forward motility was examined by incubating 10 - 100 l of sperm suspension ( 100 - 250x10 motile sperm / ml ) with various concentrations of curcumin ( 50 - 400 m  final concentration ) up to 1 hr . the percentage of forward moving sperm was recorded every 5 - 20 min  before and after incubation . 
 each experiment  including various treatment groups  was performed 3 - 5 times using sperm from 3 - 5 men or mice on different days to take care of the inter - individual variation among various sperm specimens from different men and mice . 
 the intracellular ph ( phi ) of human and mouse sperm was measured by fluorescent ph - indicator 27-bicarb - oxyethy l-5  6-carboxyfluorescein- acetoxymethylester ( bcecf - am ) ( molecular probes  eugene  or  usa ) following the manufacturer 's protocol as described by hamamah et al . 
 bcecf is a neutral lipophilic form of bis - carboxyfluorescein which diffuses freely through the plasma membrane . in the cell 
  it is hydrolyzed by esterases  releasing the bcecf which is retained within the cytoplasm . 
 the motile sperm  isolated by the swim - up procedure  were centrifuged and the pellet was washed and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs  ph=7.4 ) . 
 sperm ( 8 - 15x10/ml ) were then loaded with 2 m bcecf ( final concentration ) and incubated ( 37c  35 min ) in dark . following incubation 
  sperm were centrifuged  washed ( x2 ) and resuspended in pbs . for the intracellular ph calibration curve  
 sperm were loaded with bcecf at various extracellular phs ( phe ; 6.8  7.0  7.2  7.4  7.6 and 7.8 ) and then treated with 0.1% triton - x100 . 
 subsequently  the fluorescence intensity was measured as described below  and the calibration curve was constructed by plotting fluorescence intensity versus extracellular ph ( 24 ) . using calibration curve  
 the fluorescence intensity of bcecf is dependent upon the ph with a maximum response at an excitation of =535 nm ( f1 )  while at =490 nm ( f2 )  the intensity is independent of ph . 
 the phi was determined graphically using the ratio f1/f2 from a calibration curve obtained after permeabilization of spermatozoa with 0.1% triton by measuring the maximum fluorescence intensity after adding naoh and the minimum after adding hcl . 
 the f1/f2 ratio represents a pseudo - linear function of the ph ( 23 ) . to examine the effect of curcumin  bcecf - loaded sperm were incubated ( 37c  5 - 10 min ) with various concentrations of curcumin ( 50 - 400 m ) and then washed . 
 the treated / control sperm were transferred into wells ( 200 l / well ) of a black 96-well microplate and the fluorescence intensity was measured ( biotek synergy2 multiplatform automated plate reader ) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 535 nm  respectively . 
 each experiment  including various treatment groups  was performed 3 - 5 times using sperm from 3 - 5 men or mice on different days to take care of the inter - individual variation among various sperm specimens from different men and mice . 
 moreover  it was pertinent to examine the effect of cur - cumin per se on fluorescence intensity . 
 similar experiments carried out with various concentrations ( 50 - 400 m ) of curcumin without sperm did not affect the fluorescence intensity  indicating curcumin per se  without sperm  does not affect fluorescence intensity . 
 the changes in sperm plasma membrane polarization were examined using the fluorescence sensitive dye bis ( 13-dibarbituric acid)-trimethine oxanol [ dibac4(3 ) ] ( molecular probes  eugene  or  usa ) following the manufacturer 's protocol as described by rossato et al . 
 the motile sperm in the swim - up fraction were centrifuged  washed ( x2 ) with pbs and incubated ( 37 
 c  1 hr ) with 2 m dibac4(3 ) . 
 dibac4(3 ) can enter depolarized cells and then bind to intracellular proteins or membrane and exhibits enhanced fluorescence . 
 increased depolarization results in additional influx of the anionic dye and an increase in fluorescence . 
 sperm ( 8 - 15x 10/ml ) were then centrifuged and washed twice with pbs . 
 the dibac4(3)-incubated sperm were aliquoted in different tubes at equal volumes and incubated ( 5 - 10 min ) with various concentrations of curcumin ( 100 m  200 m  300 m  and 400 m ) . 
 after final washing with pbs  the sperm were transferred into wells ( 200 l / well ) of a black 96-well microplate and the fluorescence intensity was measured ( biotek synergy2 multiplatform automated plate reader ) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm  respectively . 
 each experiment  including various treatment groups  was performed 3 - 5 times using sperm from 3 - 5 men or mice on different days to take care of the inter - individual variation among various sperm specimens from different men and mice . 
 similar experiments carried out with various concentrations ( 50 - 400 m ) of curcumin without sperm did not affect the fluorescence intensity  indicating curcumin per se  without sperm  does not affect fluorescence intensity . 
 the significance of difference among various groups was analyzed using analysis of variance ( anova ) and tukey kramer multiple comparison test . 
 semen was liquefied and analyzed for volume  sperm concentration and percent and progressive motility . only those semen samples that had sperm concentration of > 50x10sperm / ml  percent motility of > 60%  progressive motility of > + 3 ( on a scale of 0 to + 5 )  and contamination of immature germ cells and immune cells of <

 the effect of curcumin on sperm forward motility was examined by incubating 10 - 100 l of sperm suspension ( 100 - 250x10 motile sperm / ml ) with various concentrations of curcumin ( 50 - 400 m  final concentration ) up to 1 hr . the percentage of forward moving sperm was recorded every 5 - 20 min  before and after incubation . 
 each experiment  including various treatment groups  was performed 3 - 5 times using sperm from 3 - 5 men or mice on different days to take care of the inter - individual variation among various sperm specimens from different men and mice . 
 the intracellular ph ( phi ) of human and mouse sperm was measured by fluorescent ph - indicator 27-bicarb - oxyethy l-5  6-carboxyfluorescein- acetoxymethylester ( bcecf - am ) ( molecular probes  eugene  or  usa ) following the manufacturer 's protocol as described by hamamah et al . 
 bcecf is a neutral lipophilic form of bis - carboxyfluorescein which diffuses freely through the plasma membrane . in the cell 
  it is hydrolyzed by esterases  releasing the bcecf which is retained within the cytoplasm . 
 the motile sperm  isolated by the swim - up procedure  were centrifuged and the pellet was washed and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs  ph=7.4 ) . 
 sperm ( 8 - 15x10/ml ) were then loaded with 2 m bcecf ( final concentration ) and incubated ( 37c  35 min ) in dark . following incubation 
  sperm were centrifuged  washed ( x2 ) and resuspended in pbs . for the intracellular ph calibration curve  
 sperm were loaded with bcecf at various extracellular phs ( phe ; 6.8  7.0  7.2  7.4  7.6 and 7.8 ) and then treated with 0.1% triton - x100 . 
 subsequently  the fluorescence intensity was measured as described below  and the calibration curve was constructed by plotting fluorescence intensity versus extracellular ph ( 24 ) . using calibration curve  
 the fluorescence intensity of bcecf is dependent upon the ph with a maximum response at an excitation of =535 nm ( f1 )  while at =490 nm ( f2 )  the intensity is independent of ph . 
 the phi was determined graphically using the ratio f1/f2 from a calibration curve obtained after permeabilization of spermatozoa with 0.1% triton by measuring the maximum fluorescence intensity after adding naoh and the minimum after adding hcl . 
 the f1/f2 ratio represents a pseudo - linear function of the ph ( 23 ) . to examine the effect of curcumin  
 bcecf - loaded sperm were incubated ( 37c  5 - 10 min ) with various concentrations of curcumin ( 50 - 400 m ) and then washed . 
 the treated / control sperm were transferred into wells ( 200 l / well ) of a black 96-well microplate and the fluorescence intensity was measured ( biotek synergy2 multiplatform automated plate reader ) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 535 nm  respectively . 
 each experiment  including various treatment groups  was performed 3 - 5 times using sperm from 3 - 5 men or mice on different days to take care of the inter - individual variation among various sperm specimens from different men and mice . 
 moreover  it was pertinent to examine the effect of cur - cumin per se on fluorescence intensity . 
 similar experiments carried out with various concentrations ( 50 - 400 m ) of curcumin without sperm did not affect the fluorescence intensity  indicating curcumin per se  without sperm  does not affect fluorescence intensity . 
 the changes in sperm plasma membrane polarization were examined using the fluorescence sensitive dye bis ( 13-dibarbituric acid)-trimethine oxanol [ dibac4(3 ) ] ( molecular probes  eugene  or  usa ) following the manufacturer 's protocol as described by rossato et al . 
 the motile sperm in the swim - up fraction were centrifuged  washed ( x2 ) with pbs and incubated ( 37 
 c  1 hr ) with 2 m dibac4(3 ) . 
 dibac4(3 ) can enter depolarized cells and then bind to intracellular proteins or membrane and exhibits enhanced fluorescence . increased depolarization results in additional influx of the anionic dye and an increase in fluorescence . 
 sperm ( 8 - 15x 10/ml ) were then centrifuged and washed twice with pbs . 
 the dibac4(3)-incubated sperm were aliquoted in different tubes at equal volumes and incubated ( 5 - 10 min ) with various concentrations of curcumin ( 100 m  200 m  300 m  and 400 m ) . 
 after final washing with pbs  the sperm were transferred into wells ( 200 l / well ) of a black 96-well microplate and the fluorescence intensity was measured ( biotek synergy2 multiplatform automated plate reader ) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm  respectively . 
 each experiment  including various treatment groups  was performed 3 - 5 times using sperm from 3 - 5 men or mice on different days to take care of the inter - individual variation among various sperm specimens from different men and mice . 
 similar experiments carried out with various concentrations ( 50 - 400 m ) of curcumin without sperm did not affect the fluorescence intensity  indicating curcumin per se  without sperm  does not affect fluorescence intensity . 
 the significance of difference among various groups was analyzed using analysis of variance ( anova ) and tukey kramer multiple comparison test .

 the data indicated that curcumin affects sperm forward motility starting at 100 m concentration  with a complete block at 200 m concentration within 5 - 10 min in both human and murine sperm . 
 these findings correlate well with the earlier published data ( 9 ) . in general  forward motility corresponded well with overall motility and progressive motility  as a decrease in forward motility corresponded with decrease in overall and progressive motility . 
 also  there was a loss of sperm viability when there was a decrease in forward motility . 
 the totally immotile sperm were completely non - viable as tested by eosin - nigrosin staining ( data not shown ) . 
 the present study was conducted to examine the mechanism by which curcumin affects sperm forward motility . 
 the findings indicated that curcumin acidified sperm intracellularly and hyperpolarized cell membrane of both human and mouse sperm . 
 there was a concentration - dependent decrease in phi from 7.3 to 6.81 at highest concentration ( 400 m ) of curcumin tested . 
 these findings correlate well with the effect of curcumin on human and murine sperm forward motility . 
 starting at 100 m concentration  there was a significant effect within 5 - 10 min  with a total block at 200 m concentration . 
 the phi plays an important role in modulating mammalian sperm motility ( 12  17  20 ) . 
 these cumulative findings indicate that the acidic phi inhibits sperm motility  which is in agreement with our findings . 
 the phi of 6.6 - 6.8 has been reported in one study for uncapacitated murine sperm ( 13 ) . in this study  
 this may be due to different methodologies / media and/or the strain of mice used and/or various degrees of capacitation of sperm preparations . 
 the sodium - proton membrane exchange mechanism can modulate phi and affect motility ( 26 ) . 
 the phi changes are also involved in sperm motility as the sperm cell passes through the epididymis ( 27  28 ) . also  the ph of the epididymal cauda fluid is acidic in almost all species ( 29 ) and acts directly on the phi to decrease the sperm motility ( 28 ) . 
 our extensive data search in pubmed and google scholar did not yield any publication which has examined the effect of curcumin on intracellular ph in sperm or any other cell types . 
 the degree of decrease in intracellular florescence intensity is indicative of the degree of hyperpolarization . 
 the change in sperm membrane potential has been shown to be involved in sperm motility and function ( 18  19  21  24  25  28  3033 ) . 
 for mouse sperm  intracellular alkalinization produces a hyperpolarization of sperm membrane potential which may be important for both hyperactivated motility and acrosome reaction . in this study  
 curcumin induced hyperpolarization and intracellular acidification which correlate with a reduction / block of sperm motility . 
 there was more drastic effect on hyperpolarization than on change in phi . at 50 m concentration  which did not significantly decrease the phi 
  it showed a significant effect on membrane polarization in both human and mouse sperm . 
 it is possible that curcumin may affect phi and membrane potential by interacting with different molecules and signal transduction cascades . besides sperm 
  hyperpolarization has also been connected to intracellular phi changes in several other cell systems ( 34 ) . 
 although there is no publication which has examined the effect on sperm  curcumin has been reported to affect membrane potential in other cell systems . 
 curcumin inhibits sarco / endoplasmic reticulum caatpase ( ser ca ) pump that has a major role in maintaining lower levels of intracellular [ ca ] by importing extracellular protons in rabbit skeleton muscle ( 36 ) . a study by cao et al . 
 ( 37 ) examined the effect of curcumin on changes in mitochondrial membrane potential in human hepatomag2 ( hepg2 ) cells . 
 their study showed that hepg2 cells incubated with curcumin induced oxidative damage to mitochondrial dna through mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization . 
 several molecules / mechanisms are involved in regulation of sperm intracellular ph and membrane polarization . 
 sodium - hydrogen exchange has been suggested as a mediator of ph regulation in various mammalian sperm ( 27  38  39 ) . 
 at least two sodium - hydrogen exchangers ( nhe1 and nhe5 ) have been shown to be expressed in spermatozoa . 
 the catalytic subunit of protein kinase a ( pka ) is involved in activation of motility evoked by hco3 
  anion ( 40 ) . 
 capacitation - associated hyperpolarization involves a decrease in intracellular [ na+ ] regulated by pka through activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( cftr ) ( 41 ) . 
 alkalinization activates the intracellular ph - sensitive i(ksper )  inducing the membrane potential to approach negative potentials where ca entry via i(catsper ) is maximized ( 33  42 ) . 
 the exact molecular mechanism(s ) and signal transduction pathway involved in modulation of sperm intracellular ph and membrane potential by curcumin need further investigation . 
 there are several mechanisms that can affect sperm motility / function leading to infertility ( 43  44 ) . 
 this preliminary data indicates that curcumin may inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of a subset of sperm surface proteins and ca channels ( unpublished data ) . 
 tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to be involved in sperm motility  capacitation / acrosome reaction and function ( 16 ) . 
 the findings indicate that curcumin causes intracellular acidification and membrane hyperpolarization which may be involved in inhibiting sperm forward motility . 
 this is the first study to our knowledge that examined the effect of curcumin on sperm phi and membrane potential . 
 these exciting findings will have application in deciphering the molecular mechanism(s ) involved in curcumin action and in delineating the signal transduction pathway relevant to sperm motility and function . 
 also  this data may have clinical application in development of a novel non - steroid contraceptive with spermicidal properties .

Abstract:
Curcumin, the active component in turmeric, has been shown to affect sperm motility and fertility. However, the mechanism behind this effect is not well understood. In this study, the impact of curcumin on intracellular pH and plasma membrane polarization in human and murine sperm was investigated.

Research and Discussion:
Using human and mouse sperm, the study found that curcumin caused a concentration-dependent decrease in forward motility and intracellular pH. It also induced significant hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane. These findings suggest that curcumin inhibits sperm motility through acidification and membrane hyperpolarization.

Results and Conclusion:
This study provides important insights into the molecular mechanism of curcumin's effect on sperm motility and fertility. By understanding how curcumin affects intracellular pH and membrane polarization, it may lead to the development of non-steroidal contraceptives for infertility. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the signaling pathway involved in sperm motility and function."
"the incidence of splenic abscess is a clinically uncommon disease with current literature reporting a 0.140.7% occurrence rate [ 1  2 ] . 
 although splenic abscesses are a clinical rarity  they have the potential to be fatal . 
 the presentation of this disease is often vague and insidious including left upper quadrant abdominal pain  fever and chills . 
 additionally  these patients may present with leukocytosis  left upper quadrant mass and pleural effusion on chest x - ray . 
 splenic abscesses generally occur in patients with underlying comorbidities  which commonly include neoplasia  immunodeficiency  trauma  metastatic infection  splenic infarct or diabetes . 
 the best management of splenic abscesses is still debatable with the various modalities including antibiotics  percutaneous drainage or splenectomy . 
 the current literature supports a 67100% success rate with percutaneous drainage ; however  tung et al . 
 states that the most optimal treatment for splenic abscess is splenectomy . of the 600 cases of splenic abscess documented in the current literature  
 most have been described as air confined to the left upper quadrant on chest x - ray . 
 we report a young patient with a ruptured splenic abscess resulting in an acute abdomen and pneumoperitoneum . to our knowledge 
  there have only been four other reported cases of ruptured splenic abscess causing pneumoperitoneum [ 3  4 ] . 
 a 48-year - old female with the past medical history of diabetes  coronary artery disease and psoriasis  presented with acute onset of diffuse abdominal pain 2 days prior to admission to the hospital . upon presentation  she was tachycardic with a heart rate of 130 and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 78/45 . 
 she was resuscitated in the emergency department with intravenous fluids and her blood pressure and heart rate responded appropriately . 
 her initial labs showed a normal wbc level of 8.3 thou / mcl ; however  the patient was acidotic with a ph of 7.29 and a lactic acid level of 3.5 mmol / l . 
 an acute abdominal series was obtained demonstrating free air below the right hemidiaphragm ( fig .  1 ) . 
 the patient was subsequently boarded for an exploratory laparotomy with repair of perforated viscus  as that is the usual cause of pneumoperitoneum  especially under the right hemidiaphragm . 
 because the patient 's vital signs stabilized after being resuscitated  the decision was made to obtain a ct scan to better assess the location of the perforated viscus . 
 much to our surprise  the patient did not have a perforated viscus  but a splenic abscess that had ruptured causing the pneumoperitoneum ( fig .  2 ) . 
 figure  2:ct scan demonstrating gas - forming splenic abscess and free air in the peritoneal cavity . 
 ct scan demonstrating gas - forming splenic abscess and free air in the peritoneal cavity . 
 the patient then became increasingly confused and her vital signs again deteriorated demonstrating worsening sepsis . 
 the patient was taken to the operating room where a laparoscopic splenectomy was attempted but was quickly converted to laparotomy with splenectomy due to the gross contamination of the abdomen . 
 the patient was continued on antibiotics and taken to the intensive care unit for post - operative care . 
 the splenic abscess grew prevotella intermedia  a bacterium commonly found in the oral flora . 
 the patient underwent a full work - up looking for the source of the splenic abscess . 
 a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed but was negative for any masses  thrombus or vegetation . 
 furthermore  a panorex was performed and was negative as the patient had reported tooth pain 1 week prior to her admission . 
 she returned to the clinic on post - operative day 14 to receive her splenectomy vaccinations . 
 although a rare disease  splenic abscess should be included on the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting to the hospital with peritonitis or pneumoperitoneum . 
 this is especially true for patients who are immunocompromised or have underlying comorbidities including neoplasia  diabetes  trauma or history of splenic infarct or embolization . in our case  
 ct scan provided important information about the cause of our patient 's pneumoperitoneum  as we had assumed it was due to a perforated ulcer or diverticulitis . 
 this did change our operative management  as we attempted to perform a less invasive surgery on our patient by starting with a laparoscopic technique . 
 however  we had to convert to an open splenectomy due to the gross contamination and adhesions from the splenic abscess . 
 in retrospect  an open laparotomy was the best approach to this patient 's care as it allowed for better visualization and irrigation of the abdominal cavity . 
 it is unknown if we had successfully performed the splenectomy laparoscopically if it would have decreased recovery time . 
 the current literature supports the laparoscopic splenectomy as a safe and effective procedure in patients with splenic abscess demonstrating an average length of stay of 14 days . in our case  
 the patient remained in the hospital for only 10 days after converting to the open procedure . 
 the current literature reports that the most common organisms found in splenic abscesses are aerobic microbes  particularly streptococci and escherichia coli . 
 this microbe is commonly found in the oral flora and is associated with periodontal disease . 
 although our transesophageal echocardiogram and panorex were both negative  we believe this splenic abscess developed as a result of translocation of the oral flora as the patient was complaining of a tooth ache 1 week prior to her presentation . in summary  we have presented a case of ruptured splenic abscess as a cause of pneumoperitoneum and peritonitis . 
 although rare  we encourage splenic abscess be included on the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with peritonitis and pneumoperitoneum . 
 although there is still controversy in the current literature when managing splenic abscesses  our recommendation is splenectomy  especially in the case of ruptured splenic abscess resulting in hemodynamic instability . whether it is better to perform the splenectomy laparoscopically or open is still debatable  the important thing is to obtain source control . 
 furthermore  a full work - up is required for patients presenting with a splenic abscess as the underlying cause could cause more serious illnesses for the patient in the future . 
 there are no conflicts of interests or financial funding to disclose for any of the contributing authors .","


Abstract:
This case report describes a rare presentation of a ruptured splenic abscess, without underlying neoplasm or immunosuppression, causing pneumoperitoneum and peritonitis. The patient was successfully treated with splenectomy and antibiotics, and bacterial cultures from the abscess showed oral flora as the predominant organism.

Research and Discussion:
Although a rare clinical finding, the possibility of a splenic abscess should be kept in mind when evaluating patients with pneumoperitoneum and peritonitis. In this case, no definitive cause for the abscess was identified, but it highlights the importance of considering bacterial species from the oral flora in the pathogenesis.

Results and Conclusion:
In this case, splenectomy and antibiotic treatment resulted in a positive outcome for the patient. Despite a negative work-up for the cause of the abscess, the predominant oral bacteria isolated suggests a potential link with oral hygiene. It is crucial to keep splenic abscess in mind as a potential cause of pneumoperitoneum and peritonitis for timely and appropriate management. "
"squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( scchn ) is the fifth most common neoplasm with an estimated annual global incidence of more than 500000 cases diagnosed worldwide . 
 the treatment is usually interdisciplinary and mainly involves surgeons  radiation oncologists  medical oncologists  clinical nurse specialists  speech and language specialists  and dieticians . 
 dependent on the situation  goals of the treatment can be to obtain ( i ) a high locoregional control and survival rates in patients with limited disease  ( ii ) an increased survival in patients with advanced disease ( improved locoregional control  reduced probability of distant metastasis  and second malignancies )  ( iii ) an increased organ - function preservation in resectable and unresectable tumors  and ( vi ) an increased therapeutic ratio ( cure / toxicity ratio ) . 
 single modality treatment is recommended for the patients with early - stage disease ( stage i or stage ii  approximately 40% of the patients with scchn ) and combined modality treatment for patients with locally advanced disease . 
 the combined modality treatment may include surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy  concomitant radiochemotherapy ( using conventional or alternative fractionation regimen )  and induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy [ 3  4 ] . 
 a precise understanding of prognostic factors is important to select the optimal treatment for the individual patient or to stratify patients for clinical trials or statistical analyses . in this retrospective single - institutional study  
 the role of potential prognostic factors was evaluated and compared in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oro- and hypopharynx after treatment with definitive radiotherapy / radiochemotherapy ( drt ) versus surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy ( prt ) . 
 between 1992 and 2000  288 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or hypopharynx received a radiation therapy as definitive ( n = 162 ) or as postoperative ( n = 126 ) treatment . 
 eligibility criteria for this retrospective single - institutional study were histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or hypopharynx  no distant metastasis or synchronous cancer at time of diagnosis  and definitive or postoperative radiotherapy with a minimum total dose of 60  gy . 
 one hundred and thirty - eight of 162 ( 85% ) patients treated with definitive radiotherapy received a concomitant boost fractionation regimen  and 24 ( 15% ) were treated with conventional fractionation ( single fraction dose of 2  gy  one fraction a day  five fractions a week ) . 
 two concomitant boost regimen were used : regimen 1 consisted of a total dose of 66  gy in five weeks with a daily fraction dose of 2  gy and a concomitant boost of 1.6  gy during the last two weeks ( n = 76 ) and regimen 2 of a total dose of 69.9  gy in 5.5 weeks with a daily fraction dose of 1.8  gy and a concomitant boost of 1.5  gy during the last 2.5 weeks ( n = 62 ) . 
 ninety - four of 138 ( 68% ) patients treated with concomitant boost fractionation regimen received a simultaneous chemotherapy as well as five ( 4% ) patients treated with conventional fractionation . 
 the simultaneous chemotherapy consisted of 70  mg / m carboplatin on days 15 and 2933 ( n = 73 ) or 70  mg / m carboplatin and 600  mg / m 5-fluorouracil on days 15 and 2933 ( n = 26 ) . 
 carboplatin was administered as a daily short - term intravenous infusion and 5-fluorouracil as an intravenous continuous infusion for 120 hours . for the postoperative 
 radiotherapy  only conventional fractionation without simultaneous chemotherapy was used ( n = 123 ) . 
 the radiotherapy was performed with opposed lateral fields for the upper neck and one anterior field for the lower neck using 6  mev photons . 
 patients were treated in a thermoplastic mask for immobilization  and individual blocks were used to spare normal tissue where possible . after a dose of 30 to 36  gy to the reference point  
 the spinal cord was spared out of the photon fields and the uninvolved posterior neck treated with electrons of selected energy according to ct findings with daily doses of 2.5  gy five times a week to the prescribed total dose . 
 target volumes were defined on ct scans  and the dose was calculated to midplane . in selected patients  
 pre - treatment ct scans of all patients were digitized with an automatic laser scanner ( fips plus ) . 
 the stored images were transferred to a personal computer . the macroscopic tumor shape ( primary tumor and locoregional lymph node metastases ) 
 was defined in every ct slice ( slice thickness 5  mm or 8  mm ) using a drawing tool ( software : photostyler ) . the number of pixels n enclosed by this contour was determined with a custom - shaped image processing program ( software : interactive data language ) . 
 the area ai of the ith slice was determined as ai = pixel  size  ( length)pixel  size  ( width)n . the pixel size was determined using the scaling as given on the ct - hardcopy . 
 the determined tumor area of each slice was multiplied with its slice thickness di . the ttv was approximated by 
 ( 1)vtumor(cm3)=i1mai(mm2)di(mm)/1000 . 
 repeated measurements using irregularly shaped tumor phantoms showed a difference between the reference volumes and ct - based volume measurements depending of the slice thickness ( 5  mm or 8  mm ) of 1.4% to 4.5% . 
 in addition to the quantitative tumor volumetry based on digitised pretreatment ct scans  ttv was estimated based on the postoperative histopathological report in patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy . 
 the ttv was approximated using the equation v = 4/3  abc  where a  b  and c represent the orthogonal maximal tumor diameters . 
 the overall survival was defined as the time between the first day of the treatment and death of any cause . 
 the overall survival was estimated using the kaplan - meier method  and treatment groups were compared using a two - sided log rank test . 
 the locoregional failure - free survival was defined as the time between the first day of the treatment and a locoregional failure . 
 the distant metastasis - free survival was defined as the time between the first day of the treatment and a distant failure . 
 the locoregional failure - free survival and the distant metastasis - free survival were estimated by the cumulative incidence method  and treatment groups were compared using the gray test [ 5  6 ] . 
 the simultaneous relationship of multiple prognostic factors to overall survival was assessed using cox 's proportional hazard regression analysis . 
 the simultaneous relationship of multiple prognostic factors to locoregional failure - free or distant metastasis - free survival was assessed using the hazards of the cumulative incidence function model . to estimate the reliability of the tumor volumetry  the ttv derived from digitised pretreatment ct scans 
 was compared with the ttv derived from calculations based on tumor diameters provided by the postoperative histo - pathological report of the same patients . for the method comparison  
 the median follow - up time for the censored patients treated with definitive radiotherapy / radiochemotherapy was 28.5 months and for the patients treated with adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy 36.5 months . 
 the 5-year overall survival for the patients treated with definitive radiotherapy / radiochemotherapy was 0.27 ( 95% ci 0.180.35 ) and for the patients treated with postoperative radiotherapy  0.69 ( 95% ci 0.590.79 ) . 
 patients treated with definitive radiotherapy / radiochemotherapy had a greater proportion of stage 4 tumors ( 96.9% versus 66.9% )  a much larger median ttv ( 68.4  cm versus 21.2  cm )  and a lower proportion of preradiotherapy hemoglobin level 12  g / dl ( 17.6% versus 42.6% ) . 
 the performance status was not considered in this study because it was not consistently documented in the patient files . 
 on univariate analysis  the ttv ( figures 1 and 2 ) and the pre - radiotherapy hemoglobin level had a statistically significant impact on the overall survival and on the locoregional control of patients treated with definitive radiotherapy / radiochemotherapy . 
 simultaneous chemotherapy had a statistically significant effect on the overall survival and on the incidence of distant metastasis . 
 in addition  there was a statistical trend of an association of simultaneous chemotherapy with the locoregional control ( p = 0.08 ) . 
 the n - classification had a statistically significant impact on locoregional control but no significant impact on the overall survival or metastasis - free survival . 
 on multivariate analysis  only the ttv and the simultaneous chemotherapy maintained their statistical significance ( table 3 ) . on univariate analysis  
 the ttv had a statistically significant impact on the locoregional control ( figure 3 ) . 
 the n - classification had a statistically significant impact on the incidence of distant metastasis and a statistical trend on the locoregional control ( p = 0.06 ) . 
 on multivariate analysis  only the ttv ( p = 0.05 ) maintained its statistical significance ( table 5 ) . 
 the ttv was estimated using quantitative tumor volumetry of digitized pre - treatment ct scans in all patients . 
 in addition to the ct - based volumetry  in 34 patients  the ttv was also estimated based on tumor diameters reported in the histo - pathological report . 
 the tumor volumes based on the two methods were compared to estimate the precision of the tumor volume measurements . 
 the method comparison of the 34 patients showed that the 95% limit of agreement between the two total tumor volume measurements was approximately 150% of the average total tumor volume measurement of both methods ( figure 4 ) . 
 this retrospective single institution analysis investigated possible prognostic factors of patients with squamous cell cancer of the oro- and hypopharynx treated with ( i ) definitive radiotherapy / radiochemotherapy or ( ii ) surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy . 
 the two patient groups were analysed separately because they differed considerably in respect to patient- and treatment - related characteristics and prognosis . 
 the tumor volume has been stated to be one of the most precise and most relevant predictor of radiotherapy outcome . for patients with oro- and hypopharyngeal cancer treated with definitive radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy  
 the quantitative tumor volume was identified as significant prognostic factor in the majority of studies [ 1020 ]  and in few studies  as a prognostic factor of marginal [ 21  22 ] or no significance . in the multivariate analysis of our study  the total tumor volume had a statistically highly significant impact on the overall survival and locoregional control on patients treated with definitive radiotherapy / radiochemotherapy . 
 a new finding of our study is that the total tumor volume also had a statistically significant impact on the locoregional control in patients treated with surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy . for this patient group  
 our data suggest that the total tumor volume should be used to select patients for an intensified definitive or postoperative adjuvant treatment . 
 patients treated with adjuvant simultaneous radiochemotherapy compared to adjuvant radiotherapy alone [ 24  25 ] . 
 a comparative analysis of both studies revealed the extracapsular extension of tumor from neck nodes and/or microscopically involved surgical margins as significant clinical risk factors for poor outcome . 
 the only other significant prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis for patients treated with definitive radiotherapy in our study was the application of a simultaneous chemotherapy . 
 the simultaneous chemotherapy was significantly associated with an improved overall survival and distant metastasis - free survival and showed a statistical trend of an improved locoregional control ( p = 0.15 ) . 
 randomized clinical trials [ 2735 ] and meta - analyses [ 36  37 ] have shown a significantly improved local control and survival with definitive simultaneous radiochemotherapy compared to definitive radiotherapy alone in patients with advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck . 
 interestingly  in our study  the preradiotherapy hemoglobin level was a significant prognostic factor in the univariate analysis of patients treated with definitive radiotherapy / radiochemotherapy but lost its statistical significance in the multivariate analysis . 
 if the total tumor volume was removed from the multivariate model  the pre - radiotherapy hemoglobin level retained its significance . 
 our data suggest that the total tumor volume is the stronger of both prognostic factors . 
 a significant association of the pre - radiotherapy hemoglobin concentration with the treatment outcome after definitive radiotherapy / radiochemotherapy in the absence of quantitative tumor volume data has been reported by several studies in the literature [ 3846 ] . for patients treated with postoperative radiotherapy 
  the pre - radiotherapy hemoglobin level showed no prognostic significance in our study . in the literature  
 one study found a significant impact of the pre - radiotherapy hemoglobin level on survival in patients with head and neck cancer treated with adjuvant radiotherapy . 
 other studies evaluated the prognostic significance of the hemoglobin level at different time points during the treatment . in these studies  
 no prognostic significance was found for the pre - radiotherapy hemoglobin level  but for the hemoglobin level before surgery  after surgery [ 49  50 ]  duration of low hemoglobin level during the interval between surgery and radiotherapy  or for the difference of the hemoglobin concentration before and after adjuvant radiotherapy . 
 several studies using po2 histography have shown an impact of the tumor oxygenation on the survival of patients with head and neck cancer after radiotherapy [ 5255 ]  but no clear correlation was found between the tumor oxygenation by means of po2 histography and the hemoglobin concentration [ 56  57 ] . on multivariate analysis  the potential prognostic factors  gender  age  pre - radiotherapy hemoglobin level  tumor site  t- and n-  and r - status  rt - interruptions > 5 days  and interval surgery - rt > 32 days  showed no statistical significance in our study . other prognostic factors on multivariate analysis for locally advanced head and neck cancers reported by other studies were the performance status [ 45  46 ]  high - grade acute organ toxicity  or the uicc stage . 
 our data suggest that the total tumor volume is the predominant prognostic factor in patients with squamous cell cancer of the oro- and hypopharynx treated with definitive radiotherapy / radiochemotherapy or surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy . 
 the total tumor volume should be used to identify high - risk patients and to stratify patients in clinical trials or statistical analyses .","

1) Abstract
This study compared prognostic factors between patients treated with definitive radio(chemo)therapy and surgery with postoperative radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the oro- and hypopharynx. A total of 288 patients were retrospectively analyzed, and the total tumor volume and simultaneous radiochemotherapy were found to have a significant impact on survival. 

2) Research and Discussion
In this retrospective study, 162 patients who received definitive radio(chemo)therapy and 126 patients who underwent surgery and postoperative radiotherapy were analyzed for prognostic factors. Results showed that the total tumor volume and simultaneous radiochemotherapy had a significant impact on survival for patients treated with definitive radiotherapy. 

3) Results and Conclusion
Analysis of 288 patients revealed that the total tumor volume was the most significant prognostic factor for patients treated with both definitive and postoperative radiotherapy. Simultaneous radiochemotherapy also showed a significant impact on survival for patients treated with definitive radiotherapy. These findings suggest that total tumor volume is a key factor in determining the success of radio(chemo)therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the oro- and hypopharynx. "
"measures of intellectual abilities and vocabulary  the  crystallized  abilities  are more resistant  to age effects than  fluid  abilities  such as attention and executive functions . 
 memory functions seem most affected  particularly those related to source memory (  episodic  or  explicit  ) . 
 women perform better on verbal and memory tasks  whereas men excel in spatial tasks . however  sex differences in aging effects have not . 
 some evidence suggests that  women show less age - associated cognitive decline than men . our data  on young adults ( age 1 8 - 45 years ) indicate that men show significant  decline in several neurocognitivc domains while women evince no decline . 
 we have initially studied sex difference in neurocognitivc measures with a standardized battery that  examines 8 neurobehavioral domains . in a sample of 241 healthy young adults  aged 18 to 45 ( 124 men  117 premenopausal women )  
 women had better verbal memory  and men performed better on spatial and motor tasks . however  we did not . 
 observe better performance in women for the language domain ( figure 1 ) . in examining components of domains that show sex differences  we find that the verbal memory advantage for women is accounted for primarily by performance on the california verbal learning test ( cvlt/ 
 figure 2 )  whereas the advantage for men in spatial abilities is accounted for by performance on benton 's line orientation test . 
 some sex differences are manifested not in the profile of abilities  but in the effects of aging within the range of young adulthood . in our sample  no significant correlations were observed between age and any of the behavioral measures in women ( correlations ranged from -0.15 to 0.09 ) . for men  however  increased age was associated with decrease in performance on attention ( r=0.43  p=0.0001 )  verbal memory ( r=-0.20  p=0.029 )  spatial memory ( r=-0.34  p=0.0001 )  and spatial abilities ( r=-0.33  p=0.0002 ) ( all df=122  all p values are 2-tailed ) ( figure 3 ) . and ( figure 4 ) . 
 the battery is lengthy  and each test provides measures that are difficult to link with current  knowledge on brain systems regulating behavior . 
 furthermore  tests comprising such batteries are not readily applied in functional imaging studies  and few alternative forms are available for repeated testing . to address these limitations 
 our general approach to task development and validation process was detailed in gur et al . 
 advantages of the computerized battery include : ( i ) each measure is designed to probe a narrow and well - defined neurobehavioral domain ; ( ii ) more uniform presentation of test stimuli ; ( iii ) errorless data entry and scoring ; ( iv ) availability of reaction time data ; ( v ) shorter time for administration ; and ( vi ) alternative forms can be readily generated using set algorithms . 
 is more  impersonal  ; ( ii ) some participants  particularly the elderly  dislike computers or require training ; and ( iii ) tests are not . yet available for some well - validated indices of language functioning  particularly those involving verbal output ( eg  vocabulary  verbal fluency ) . 
 however  our experience with computerized testing indicates that the first two disadvantages can be overcome  and the third can be addressed with available technology . 
 most older adults respond well to computerized testing  if approached properly  and we have developed a short module that trains participants in the use of the mouse to the level required for testing . 
 the normative data have shown very favorable psychometric characteristics such as high inter - item consistency ( cronbach 's alpha )  test - retest reliability  and comparable levels of difficulty ( at 70% to 80% correct for the normative sample ) and true - score variance . 
 our efforts to generate the kind of sensitivity that  will permit  differentiation within healthy people have also been successful . as can be seen in figure 5  the summary scores show sex differences in young adults . 
 the pattern of sex differences duplicates that obtained with traditional batteries  but adds the finding that women do better in facial memory  not available in the traditional battery . 
 measures of reaction and testing time provide an efficiency ( accuracy / time ) index  used to calculate comparable z scores across tests . 
 algorithms can generate multiple forms for repeated administration  and error analysis is performed for items and parameters to examine strategy and persistence . 
 perceiving  experiencing  and expressing emotions seem essential capacities  and more recently the study of emotion has benefited from converging methodologies in animals and humans . 
 the face has been the main target of study in humans  and methods were applied to quantify expression of emotion with cross - cultural consistency standardized tools have been developed for measuring emotion discrimination  mood induction  affective valence  and arousal . 
 emotional displays that  can be reliably coded in the face are happiness  sadness  anger  fear  and disgust ( surprise is more controversial ) . 
 seems to be organized  perhaps parallel to the  cognitive  system  along laterality and anterior - posterior dimensions . ' 
 ittiere is controversy about whether emotional expression is lateralized  although a meta - analysis by borod et al seems to confirm that negative emotions are expressed more intensely on the left side of the face  whereas the opposite holds for positive emotions : there is more agreement  though fewer data  that  receptive  experiential  and expressive aspects of emotion processing can be mapped to frontal  temporal  and parieto - occipital involvement  respectively . 
 this interaction between the emotion and cognitive systems   particularly as it applies to memory  is an issue of current interest . 
 large - scale studies with standardized measures have indicated that elderly people are in better mood than their young counterparts . 
 gross et al examined cross - cultural samples for age differences and concluded that older adults reported fewer negative emotional experiences and greater emotional  control . 
 however  findings regarding emotional expressivity were less consistent  with older participants reporting less expressivity . 
 there is also evidence that the elderly are more vulnerable than the young to adverse effects of negative emotional states on memory and other cognitive abilities . 
 indeed  it has been suggested that depressed mood is the strongest predictor of health decline in the elderly . 
 women perform better in speeded emotion recognition tasks and in tasks requiring facial expression of emotions . in a study of facial recognition  we reported sex differences in sensitivity to happy and sad expressions depending on the poser 's sex 
 . women were more sensitive to opposite than to same - sex expressions  whereas men were differentially poor at detecting sadness in female faces . 
 regarding emotional experience  women are more prone to clinical depression  mood fluctuations associated with phases of the menstrual cycle have been documented  and such phase - associated hormonal changes may relate to cognitive performance . 
 magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) studies of the brain have documented that  aging is associated with progressive parenchymal volume decrease and cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) volume increase . 
 some studies suggest that the volume decrease with age is in gray matter ( gm ) tissue  while others report a decrease also in the white matter ( wm . ) compartment . 
 there is more consistency in the regional distribution of effects  with mesolimbic  temporal  and frontal regions showing greater vulnerability . 
 sex differences have been observed in the compartmental composition of intracranial volumes  in the volume and density of language - associated cortex  and in the rate of age - associated changes . while the data indicate less parenchymal loss in women than in men  particularly for frontal and temporal regions  samples were limited in the elderly cohorts . 
 our data in the elderly suggest  similar rates of tissue loss in men and women  perhaps reflecting an acceleration following menopause . 
 henkel et al concluded that age - related decline in source memory affects  processes involved in binding features into complex memories and [ ... ] contextual features of memories .  neural substrates for the source memory system implicate the mesial temporal and frontal regions . 
 henkel ct al 's hypothesis  based on behavioral data  is supported in raz et al 's study . 
  while the volume of limbic structures was unrelated to cognitive functions across the age range  in older participants reduction predicted declines in explicit memory . 
 neural substrates for age - related changes in affect are less clearly defined  although recent work affords some hypotheses that  should be tested . 
 studies on networks for emotion have implicated the amygdala  hypothalamus  mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic systems  and projections to orbital and dorsolateral frontal  temporal  and parietal cortex . 
 studies in patients with brain lesions support  the role of these regions in emotion regulation . 
 the link between age - related changes in neuroanatomy and performance on such tasks has not been established . to evaluate how these effects extend across agegroups  
 the correlation between age and total intracranial volume was nil ( r=0.02 )  indicating no secular drift in head size . 
 for the young ( < 50 years ) sample considered separately  there was a. small yet significant correlation between age and gm volume ( r=-0.17  df=130  p<0.05 ) . 
 this correlation was higher in men ( r=-0.27  df=74  p<0.01 ) than in women ( r=-0.01  df=54  ns ) . 
 age did not correlate significantly with wm or csf volumes in this age - group . 
 for the entire age range  gm continues to decline in volume with aging  r(184)=-0.49  r(92)=-0.52  and r(90)=-0.40 for the whole sample  males and females  respectively  all p<0.0001  whereas the volume of csf continues to increase with age ( the corresponding correlations were 0.31  0.45  and 0.29  all p<0.0001 ) . 
 wm changes are less clear . although the correlation with age is not significant for the entire sample  r=0.09  within each sex the correlations were small but positive  r=0.28  p=0.01 and r=0.24  p=0.02 . 
 we conclude that gm volume is reduced with aging  csf volume increases concomitantly  while wm volume does not change appreciably and is perhaps increased slightly . while the effects of gm and csf agree with a recent study by guttmann et al  their conclusion regarding wm . was that its percentage of the intracranial compartments 
  it appears that they examined only percentages and not raw volumes . in the case of guttmann 
 et al 's study  reduced % wm could reflect age effects on another compartment  for example  increased csf . 
 perhaps the paucity of subjects in our elderly group is matched by the paucity of theirs in the young group ( 10 participants < 40 years ) . 
 our sample also enabled examination of whether these volume changes are related to cognitive performance . 
 while the young and elderly participants received age - appropriate neuropsychological batteries  both groups received several identical tests . 
 the total number of items recalled during the memorization trials was correlated with the volumes of brain parenchyma ( gm . 
 as can be seen in figure 6  parenchymal volume goes down with age  number of words recalled also declines  and the parenchymal volume is associated with memory ( even with age effects partialled out ) . 
 the feasibility of studying neural substrates of behavior is enhanced by functional imaging methods for measuring regional brain activity . 
 activation patterns are linked to performance on cognitive tasks requiring verbal  spatial  attention  memory  and facial processing . 
 the study of age effects on regional brain physiology has been quite extensive  with considerable agreement that cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) shows age - related decline even in people screened for cerebrovascular disorders . 
 similarly  measures of neurotransmitter function have shown reduced availability of both dopaminergic and serotonergic transmitter activity . 
 the decline has been linked to performance on behavioral tasks related to the dopaminergic system . 
 the effects of aging on glucose metabolism are less clear  although it too shows decline  particularly in frontal and temporal regions . 
  of most relevance to the study of the memory and emotion systems  cherrier et 
 al have examined correlations between mood state self - ratings and cerebral metabolism during pet 18f - fdg in 27 persons with age - associated memory impairment ( aged 44 - 81 years ) . 
 specifically  regions involved in both mood and memory had similar abnormalities . there have been reports of boredom related to mesial temporal and parietal asymmetry as well as decreased parietal metabolism . 
 thse findings suggest that  mood changes may influence metabolism in brain regions implicated in emotion and memory function . 
 there are fewer data on the effects of aging on regional brain activation in response to task demands . using the 133xe method  we found substantial age - related decline in overall cbf values  but the pattern of lateralized changes in response to verbal and spatial tasks was identical in young and elderly people . 
 however  we used tasks that are quite resistant to age effects  and the results may differ for tasks showing greater age - related decline . 
 indeed  cabeza ct al found less frontal activation  measured with h2 
 0 pet cbf  in elderly people for a memory task . 
 madden et al in a cbf study using spect reported that several cbf activations were greater for young than for older adults . 
 however  they observed that  although performance demonstrated  a greater age - related slowing for visual encoding than for semantic retrieval   these changes  were not associated with corresponding changes in rcbf activation .  the association between cbf activation and performance  and the effects of aging on this association  merit further elucidation . 
 several studies examined emotion processing with functional neuroimaging methods in healthy people . with the xe method for measuring cortical cbf during processing emotional facial expressions  we noted increased right temporoparietal activity . with a mood induction procedure  increased cbf was observed during sad induction and correlated with mood change . 
  in a pet study with h2 
 0  we reported a cbf increase in the left amygdala and a cbf decrease in the right amygdala during sad mood . 
 subsequent studies with pet and functional mri ( fmri ) have confirmed the lesion data  implicating amygdala and anterior brain regions in mood  while posterior regions seem activated in visual emotion discrimination . 
 unlike neuroanatomic studies that have consistently examined sex differences and age effects  there is a paucity of neurophysiologic studies that have examined these factors . using the xe cbf method 
  we reported that women have higher rates of cortical cbf  and this finding was replicated and extended to other methods that measure cbf for the entire cranium . 
 we found about equal rates of age - associated reduction in cbf in men and women  and this has also been reported in other studies  although samples were usually small in the elderly range . 
 no studies have linked changes in cbf activation to sex differences in agerelated neuroanatomic changes and to performance of memory and emotion tasks . 
 the method has several potential advantages : higher spatial and temporal resolution  noninvasiveness and lack of ionizing radiation  direct correlation with anatomical imaging  greater repeatability  and economy . 
 the disadvantages of fmri techniques include : loud background noise generated by the gradients ; difficulties in presenting stimuli and performing tasks in the magnet  bore ; claustrophobia ; low signal - to - noise for most methods ; and lack of quantification in physiologic units for most methods . among the various fmri methods  blood oxygenation level - dependent 
 this technique relies on magnetic susceptibility effects of deoxyhemoglobin  which cause regional decreases in signal in imaging sequences sensitive to susceptibility ( eg  echoplanar ) . with regional brain activation studies  a net increase in signal intensity is observed in regions known to be activated by the task . 
 this is attributed to an increase in regional blood flow compared to regional oxygen consumption . 
 a typical response is a 1 % to 25% increase in regional image intensity  which develops over 3 to 8 seconds following task initiation . 
 susceptibility effects are field dependent so  using the 4-t magnet  available to us  an initial decrease in signal intensity is detectable in the first 1 to 2 seconds following stimulation  corresponding to a focal increase in deoxyhemoglobin . when combined with ultrafast echoplanar imaging ( -100 ms per slice )  the time course of signal change in response to individual stimuli can thus be observed . to evaluate task - induced regional activation  
 we have applied a verbal and a spatial task previously demonstrating regional activation with other methods . 
 this study examined activation for a spatial task ( judgment  of line orientation ) compared with a. verbal reasoning task ( analogies ) in a sample of 29 healthy participants ( 15 men and 14 women ) . 
 an image - based multisubject analysis was performed by registering the brains of the different subjects . a well - characterized brain registration algorithm was used to register the tl images from the different subjects to that of one particular subject . 
 once registered  the statistics were summed across subjects and divided by the square root of the number of subjects  as is appropriate for independent  normally distributed variables . 
 the statistical images were smoothed by convolution with a gaussian kernel with full width at half maximum of 12 mm and thresholded at a. 
					 p 
				  value of 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons using the theory of gaussian random fields . 
 the activation map in figure 7 
  indicates that the hypothesized left - lateralized changes were seen for the verbal task in posterior temporal and inferior parietal regions  while right - latcralizcd increase was seen for the spatial task in these regions . 
 this imagebased analysis revealed a. distributed network of cortical regions  which expanded for the hard verbal task and became more circumscribed for the hard spatial task . 
 the task by hemisphere interactions for the hypothesized inferior parietal  superior temporal  and planum temporale regions were significant at an order of magnitude comparable to what we have obtained with other methods ( all f<0.001 ) . 
 appears that spatial processing requires  for harder tasks  greater reliance on visual association cortex with minimal activation of other areas . 
 poorer performance in women may relate to continued reliance on supplementary strategies  perhaps verbal  which are ineffective for the success on the harder spatial items . 
 effects of aging on regional activation in relation to cognitive strategics have not yet been examined with fmri . 
 as is generally the case for age - related changes  the hormonal environment  can have pervasive effects that require scrutiny  not only during early development  
				  but also during the perimenopausal phase . 
 menopause is a single event in a progressive process of ovarian aging beginning with increased frequency of menstrual disturbances and anovulation as follicular units are depleted . 
 the process is accelerated after age 37  ultimately culminating in the virtual absence of follicles and capacity to generate significant quantities of estradiol . 
 the median chronological age at menopause in the usa is 51.4 years ( range 48 to 55 years ) . 
 estrogen decrease is associated with substantial central nervous system ( cns ) alterations including vasomotor instability  insomnia  depression  and cognitive decline . 
 recent  studies suggest that estrogen has a protective effect with respect to onset of alzheimer 's disease and cognitive decline . 
 there is evidence that neurobiologie processes triggered by the hormonal changes exert influence by affecting neurotransmitter availability  cerebral perfusion  and perhaps by eliminating neuroprotective effects of estrogen . in a recent study by matteis et al  using transcranial doppler ultrasonography  they found  as we did  higher flow estimates in women than men overall . 
 however  a subgroup of 15 postmenopausal women aged 48 to 53 years had lower flow values than 15 premenopausal women of the same age  or any other group . 
 there is increasing evidence across behavioral  neuroanatomic  and neurophysiologic domains that sex differences play a prominent role in modulating the effects of aging on brain function . 
 the overall finding is that age - related decline begins earlier in men than in women . 
 the decline is most pronounced in frontotemporal regions associated with attention  inhibition  and memory . 
 more specific tasks using a computerized approach can help better delineate associations between agerelated decline and aspects of cognitive and emotion processing . 
 the sex differences in brain aging may be further investigated on the molecular level and data on other physiologic parameters  such as glucose and oxygen metabolism and receptor function  could help further elucidate mechanisms for explaining these differences . 
 such studies could ultimately help explain a range of phenomena related to sex differences including cognition and emotion processing . 
 although we have focused on findings in healthy people  the effects have implications for brain disorders where gender differences have been observed across the life span . 
 for example  neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit and learning disabilities are more common in boys  schizophrenia is more severe in young men  and depression is more common in women . 
 understanding the neural basis of these disorders can be advanced by considering sex differences in brain function . 
 the clinical implications of these findings need to be examined in relation to disease presentation and course . in view of the greater vulnerability of males in prefrontal regions 
  one would expect  brain disorders affecting these regions to be more severe and perhaps requiring multimodal therapeutic interventions . 
 for females  with improved understanding of regional brain activity during emotion processing  we maybe in a position to explain the neurobiology of increased vulnerability to depression . finally  the measures employed in this work seem sensitive to variability in healthy people and may therefore serve as endophenotypic markers of vulnerability to neuropsychiatrie disorders in which sex differences are evident and may contribute to developing genetic models .","

1) Abstract: Advances in neuroscience allow us to examine the relationships between gender, aging, and brain-behavior through neurobehavioral, neuroanatomic, and neurophysiology measures.
2) Research and Discussion: Through neurobehavioral and neuroanatomic studies, we see differences in cognitive and emotion processing, brain volume, and functional activity between healthy men and women as they age.
3) Results and Conclusion: Our findings suggest that ovarian hormones play a key role in understanding these gender and aging effects on the brain. Further integration of methodologies will provide a better understanding of healthy individuals and brain disorders across the lifespan."
"the purpose of this process is to destroy and remove the injurious agents and injured tissues  thereby promoting tissue repair . 
 when this beneficial response occurs in an uncontrolled manner  the result is excessive cellular / tissue damage that results in chronic inflammation and destruction of normal tissue . 
 moreover  inflammatory airway and lung diseases  such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd )  are characterized by chronic inflammation . 
 many of the known inflammatory target proteins  such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( mmp-9 )  intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( icam-1 )  vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( vcam-1 )  cyclooxygenase-2 ( cox-2 )  and cytosolic phospholipase a2 ( cpla2 )  are associated with inflammatory signaling pathways induced by various stimuli  including tumor necrosis factor- ( tnf- )  interleukin-1 ( il-1 )  adenosine-5-triphosphate ( atp )  cigarette smoke extract ( cse )  lipoteichoic acid ( lta )  or lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) [ 26 ] . 
 airway smooth muscle is considered as an end - response effector regulating regional differences in ventilation by contracting in response to various proinflammatory mediators and exogenous substances released under homeostatic or pathologic conditions  such as asthma . 
 lung cells  in particular alveolar epithelial type ii cells  are susceptible to the injurious effects of oxidants . 
 it has been shown that lung cells release inflammatory mediators and cytokines / chemokines  such as il-1  il-6  il-8  and tnf- in response to oxidative stress . moreover  
 the sfks  pkc  growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors  nadph oxidase / ros  pi3k / akt  and mapks are components of signaling cascades that respond to extracellular stimuli by targeting transcription factors  such as nf-b and ap-1  resulting in the modulation of inflammatory gene expression . thus  this review will focus on some general aspects of inflammatory signaling regulation and summarize current knowledge regarding the presence and functional roles of these inflammatory signal molecules within the respiratory system  and their proposed involvement in the expression inflammatory target proteins in response to proinflammatory mediators during airway and lung inflammation . 
 the pharmacological interventions protect against inflammation - induced airway and lung diseases will be discussed . 
 leukocytes continuously circulate throughout the body in order to come in contact with antigens sequestered within tissues . to enter tissues  circulating leukocytes migrate from the blood  between vascular endothelial cells and into the tissue . 
 during this migration  leukocytes initially bind to endothelial cells via low affinity adhesion molecules . the low affinity adhesion in combination with the force of the blood flow results in rolling of leukocytes on endothelial cells . 
 vcam-1 is one of the inducible cell transmembrane glycoproteins of the immunoglobulin supergene family expressed on several cell types and plays an important role in a number of inflammatory and immune responses . 
 it was first identified as an adhesion molecule induced on endothelial cells by proinflammatory cytokines or lps [ 11  12 ] . in normal processes  vcam-1 is important during development since a vcam-1 knockout is an embryonic lethal . in pathogenesis  vcam-1 expression is induced on endothelial cells during inflammatory bowel disease  atherosclerosis  infection  and asthmatic responses [ 1315 ] . 
 upregulation of vcam-1 expression on cytokine - triggered vascular endothelial cells enhances the targeted transmigration of pmns into extravascular space of inflammation . in airways  to reach the submucosa and airway lumen  circulating pmns must first be recruited across the vascular endothelium   and then migrate through the interstitial matrix before interacting with airway epithelium . 
 accumulation of inflammatory cells within the airways can be influenced by expression of adhesion molecules on airway epithelium . 
 thus  similar processes that govern pmns adhesion to lung airway resident cells may occur and contribute to the damage to these cells seen in inflammatory responses of asthma . 
 this event is crucial in the development of allergic inflammation and is mediated by adhesion molecules and cytokines . 
 icam-1 is an endothelial- and leukocyte - associated transmembrane protein long known for its importance in stabilizing cell - cell interactions and facilitating leukocyte endothelial transmigration . 
 more recently  icam-1 has been characterized as a site for the cellular entry of human rhinovirus . 
 because of these associations with immune responses  many researchers have hypothesized that icam-1 could function in signal transduction . 
 earlier studies showed that icam-1 gene is highly expressed in pulmonary fibroblasts of copd patients . 
 in addition  blocking pulmonary icam-1 expression ameliorates lung injury in established diet - induced pancreatitis . 
 thus  adhesion molecules play a key role in regulating inflammation in respiratory disorders ( figure 1 ) 
 the first class of pla2 is secretary pla2 ( spla2 ) that is expressed in a variety of cell types   and it has no preference for aa at sn-2 position  requires millimolar amounts of ca for activity and is sensitive to sulfhydryl reducing agents  such as dithiothreitol ( dtt )  and is resistant to heat or acid conditions . 
 the second class of pla2 is calcium - independent pla2 ( ipla2 ) that does not require ca for catalytic activity . 
 ipla2 prefers plasmalogen substrates and does not appear to have a preference for the type of fatty acid at the sn-2 position . 
 the third class is the novel  high molecular weight ( 85  kda ) cytosolic pla2 ( cpla2 ) . 
 cpla2 enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of the sn-2 position of membrane glycerophospholipids  leading to production of free fatty acids and lysophospholipids . 
 this reaction is of particular importance if the esterified fatty acid is arachidonic acid ( aa )  which is converted by downstream metabolic enzymes to various bioactive lipophilic compounds called eicosanoids  including prostaglandins ( pgs ) and leukotrienes ( lts ) . 
 the increase in cpla2 activation and expression following external stimuli  including proinflammatory cytokines  growth factors  and microbial toxin  is often observed in several systems . 
 the implication of cpla2 in inflammatory diseases has been confirmed by that the airway anaphylactic response in the cpla2 knockout mice is markedly reduced compared with that in the wild - type mice . 
 moreover  cpla2-deficient mice have provided the most definitive evidence for the central role of cpla2 in eicosanoid   as well as in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases  such as acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) due to bacterial sepsis [ 30  31 ] . 
 these studies have demonstrated that there was a reduction in the bronchial lumen and alveolar thickening in the control mice that was remarkably absent in the cpla2 knockout mice . 
 this outcome also appeared in 5-lipoxygenase ( lo)-knockout mice and mice with pgd2 receptor deficiency . 
 thus  cpla2 seems to function as a crucial upstream regulator of the production of eicosanoids for airway resistance during allergic inflammation and is correlated to the process of asthma ( figure 1 ) . 
 the inhibition of cpla2-mediated pathways may also provide a therapeutic approach to airway and lung injury . 
 cox metabolites have diverse effects in the lung and are known to modify airway tone as well as inflammatory responses . 
 cox-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and considered to be the  housekeeping  isoform that produces pgs which are required for maintenance of normal cell and organ function . 
 in contrast  cox-2 is primarily an inducible isoform whose expression can be upregulated in many cell types by cytokines  mitogens  and endotoxin [ 3  4 ] . 
 it is highly expressed in inflamed tissues and believed to produce pgs involved in inflammatory processes . 
 cox-2 has multiple transcriptional regulatory sequences in its promoter region  including a tata box  an nf - il6 motif  two ap-2 sites  three sp1 sites  two nf-b sites  a cre motif  and an e - box . cox-2 
 gene expression can be induced by multiple cytokines and growth factors  via activation of transcriptional regulatory proteins that act on these promoter sites . 
 thus  cox-2 appears to be the primary cox controlling pge2 synthesis in response to inflammation ( figure 1 ) . 
 cox effects are widespread and extremely complex ; however  studies in knockout mice for cox-1 versus cox-2 reveal sometimes overlapping  not altogether predictable roles for these two enzymes . 
 the levels of prostanoids in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are increased in asthma  and several studies have found enhanced expression of both cox-1 and cox-2 in the airways of asthmatics [ 36  37 ] . 
 a recent research has renewed interest in the role of prostanoids in allergic airway disease . 
 moreover  the expression of cox-2 protein induced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg ( lgg )  endotoxin  and lipoteichoic acid ( lta ) in t84 epithelial cells . 
 the presence of cox-3 mrna transcript  with a size of approximately 5.2  kb  was subsequently confirmed in human cells ; cox-3 was in highest concentrations in the cerebral cortex and heart tissue . 
 however  the retention of intron 1 in cox-3 seems to slow its enzymatic activity in comparison to cox-1 and cox-2 . 
 thus  the inhibition of cox-2-mediated inflammatory pathway may provide a therapeutic approach to respiratory diseases . 
 mmps are proteolytic enzymes that are able to degrade extracellular matrix ( ecm ) components and  thus  play a role in cell migration and tissue remodeling . 
 moreover  they can splice and ( in)activate cytokines and chemokines  thereby influencing the recruitment and function of inflammatory cells . to date  24 mmps have been identified in mammals ; cellular sources include inflammatory  stromal  and epithelial cells . 
 some mmps are anchored to the cell surface  whereas others are secreted into the extracellular space . 
 they are released as inactive proenzymes and are activated by proteolytic cleavage of the n - terminal domain . 
 most mmps are constitutively secreted once they become translated . in gelatinase subfamily of mmps ( mmp-2 and mmp-9 )  the catalytic domain that includes the zn binding site also contains repeats of fibronectin motifs allowing the ability to bind gelatin  their major substrate . 
 patients with asthma have an increased gelatinolytic activity linked to mmp-2 and mmp-9 and higher levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 ( timp-1 ; a natural inhibitor of mmps ) in their sputum . 
 the activated form of mmp-9 ( 85  kda ) was found in the sputum from 60% of asthmatics  but was absent from that of control subjects . 
 although less frequently detectable than pro - mmp-9 ( pro - mmps are catalytically inactive and are activated into the active mmp after cleaving of the prodomain )  pro - mmp-2 ( 72  kda ) was also found more frequently in asthmatics ( 50% ) than in control subjects ( 5% ) . 
 in addition  patients with copd have an increased gelatinolytic activity in sputum linked to mmp-2 and mmp-9 . in smokers with emphysema  mmp-8 and mmp-9 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) fluid 
 were significantly higher than in smokers without emphysema . in vitro cultured human airway smooth cells and a549 cells  tnf- and il-1 
 induce mmp-9 expression and cell migration [ 2  43  44 ] via various signaling pathways  such as pkc  mapks  nf-b  and ap-1 . 
 thus  mmps and their inhibitors ( timps ) play multiple functions in physiological processes and interact with many other mediators regulating inflammatory processes  cell behavior  and angiogenesis . 
 these mediators are implicated in many intricate loops of reciprocal interactions rendering the understanding of the role of mmps in regulatory processes difficult . in many respiratory diseases  
 mmps are overexpressed or oversecreted leading to both deregulation of physiological homeostatic processes and ecm degradation and disorganization ( figure 1 ) . 
 pkcs are important in many cellular responses in the lung  including permeability  contraction  migration  hypertrophy  proliferation  apoptosis  and secretion . 
 pkc is a family of serine / threonine kinases characterized by at least eleven different isotypes . 
 pkc isotypes are differentially regulated by calcium ( ca )  diacylglycerol  and phospholipids and differ in structure  expression  intracellular localization  substrate utilization  and mechanisms of activation . 
 the pkc isotypes are subdivided into three groups : the classical  novel  and atypical . 
 this subdivision is based on the structural and functional differences in the conserved domains c1c4 . 
 the classical pkc  pkci / ii  and pkc isotypes are ca and diacylglycerol dependent . 
 the novel pkc  pkc  pkc  pkc  and pkc isotypes contain c2 domains that lack ca - binding ability but still retain functional c1a and c1b domains that can bind the endogenous diacylglycerol and exogenous phorbol esters . 
 the atypical pkc  pkc  and pkc isotypes lack a functional c2 domain and contain a single c1 domain that lacks the ability to bind diacylglycerol and phorbol esters . 
 therefore  the mechanism of activation of the atypical pkc isotypes is both ca and diacylglycerol independent . 
 moreover  pkcs are important signaling intermediates in chronic airway diseases like asthma and copd . 
 resident airway epithelial cells produce proinflammatory mediators under the regulation of pkc . increased pkc activity increases nf-b - dependent proinflammatory cytokine generation in human airway epithelial cells  while expression of a dominant negative pkc mutant has inhibiting effects . in human airway smooth muscle cells  pkc  i          and  are found in the cytosol and ii in the membrane under basal conditions . 
 the proinflammatory neuropeptide bradykinin ( bk ) causes activation of pkc  i    and  when applied to airway smooth muscle cells . 
 bk also induces cox-2 protein expression and pge2 accumulation in human airway smooth muscle cells via a pkc-dependent signaling . 
 pkc is increased in the lungs of patients with copd and is thought to be important in the hypertrophy and proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells . 
 pkc activity is also increased in proliferating human airway smooth muscle cells . on the other hand  pkc is important in mediating the effects of proinflammatory cytokines by phosphorylating cpla2 leading to the release of aa from phospholipids with subsequent production of bioactive eicosanoids in activated cells . 
 at least three pkcs are expressed in interstitial fibroblasts  including pkc    and  . 
 activation of pkc causes decreased collagen expression via the extracellular signal - regulated kinase kinase ( mek)/erk signaling cascade  a response that is opposed by pkc . 
 selected pkcs are activated by lps  leading to the production of the proinflammatory cytokines  such as tnf-  il-  and il-6 . 
 in addition  thrombin causes an increase in cytosolic [ ca ] and activation of selected pkcs . 
 tnf- has been shown to induce mmp-9 expression via a pkc-dependent pathway in a549 cells . 
 taken together  these studies indicated that pkcs play a critical role in mediating inflammation and respiratory diseases ( figure 2 ) . 
 because multiple signaling pathways contribute to the key cellular responses important in lung biology  therapeutic strategies targeting pkcs may be more effective if combined with inhibitors of other pathways for additive or synergistic effect . 
 mechanisms that regulate pkc activity  including phosphorylation and interaction with isozyme - specific binding proteins  are also potential therapeutic targets in the respiratory diseases . 
 ros are products of normal cellular metabolism and are known to act as second messengers . under physiological conditions  
 ros participate in maintenance of cellular  redox homeostasis  to protect cells against oxidative stress . 
 in addition  regulation of redox state is important for cell activation  viability  proliferation  and organ function . however  overproduction of ros  most frequently due to excessive stimulation of either reduced nadph by proinflammatory cytokines or the mitochondrial electron transport chain and xanthine oxidase  results in oxidative stress . 
 oxidative stress is a deleterious process that leads to airway and lung damage and consequently to several respiratory inflammatory diseases / injuries . 
 ros are intracellularly generated from several sources  including mitochondrial respiration  cytochrome p450  the nadph oxidase system  and xanthine / xanthine oxidase . 
 however  the major ros generating enzyme is nadph oxidase  a membrane - bound multicomponent enzyme complex that is present in phagocytes as well as nonphagocytic cells . 
 first  superoxide produced by nadph oxidase 2 is required for respiratory burst that occurs in phagocytes  leading to microbial killing . 
 ros derived from nadph oxidase can specifically and reversibly react with proteins  altering their activity  localization  and half - life . 
 activated phagocytic cells generate ros via assembly and activation of the nadph oxidase complex  which comprises membrane - associated flavocytochrome b558 ( gp91 ) and p22 and various cytosolic cofactors ( p47  p67  and p40  and the gtpase  rac1 ) and mediates transmembrane electron transfer from the major cellular electron donor  nadph  to reduce molecular o2 to superoxide anion ( o2 ) and hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) . a number of homologs of the main business end of nadph oxidase  gp91  have been discovered  and mammalian systems are now known to contain seven nadph oxidase homologs  comprising nadph oxidase 15 ( nadph oxidase 2 being the new name for gp91 ) and two larger dual oxidases  duox1 and duox2  which are widely expressed in many cell types to mediate a variety of biological functions  such as cell mitosis  differentiation  migration  and immune regulation . in in vitro studies  using macrophages  alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells  ros have been shown to induce gene expression of inflammatory mediators  such as il-1 and tnf- [ 57  58 ] . patients with asthma demonstrate increased generation of ros  such as superoxide anion  hydrogen peroxide  and hydroxyl radicals . 
 increased production of ros has been demonstrated by many cell types within the lung in asthma  including macrophages  antigen - presenting cells ( apcs )  neutrophils  and eosinophils . 
 excessive production of ros correlates with the degree of airway hyperresponsiveness  as quantified by methacholine challenge . 
 in addition  oxidative stress also contributes to a proteinase - antiproteinase imbalance  both by inactivating antiproteinases  such as 1-antitrypsin and secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor  and by activating proteinases  such as mmps . on the other hand 
  oxidants also promote inflammation by activating nf-b or ap-1  which orchestrates the expression of multiple inflammatory genes recognized to be important in copd  such as tnf-. recently  phagocytic nadph oxidase - ros signaling has been shown to play a critical role in promoting tnf--induced  nf-b - dependent acute inflammatory responses  and tissue injury specifically in the lungs  which is effected by preferential leukocyte infiltration . 
 thus  oxidative stress plays a critical role in inflammatory responses in airway and lung diseases via the upregulation of redox - sensitive transcription factors ( such as ap-1 or nf-b ) and thereby proinflammatory genes ( such as mmp-9  vcam-1  icam-1  cox-2  or cpla2 ) expression . 
 taken together  nadph oxidase / ros play a critical role during development of airway and lung diseases ( figure 2 ) . 
 the pi3k family are central signaling elements in a diverse array of cellular functions  including growth  proliferation  migration  and survival . 
 it is  therefore  understandable that dysregulation of pi3k has been implicated in the induction and/or progression of a variety of disease states  including those of the respiratory tract  ranging from asthma to cancer . pi3ks 
 type i pi3ks are activated by cell surface receptors  such as growth factors  insulin  and g - protein - coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) . 
 class ii pi3ks comprised     and  isoforms  which are characterized by the presence of a c2 domain at the c terminus . 
 structurally  pi3ks ia exist as heterodimeric complexes in which a catalytic p110 subunit ( designated as     or  ) is in association with a particular regulatory subunit ( designated as p85  p55  and p50 ) . 
 importantly  pi3k ia signals downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase and ras . the single class pi3k ib consists of the p110 catalytic subunit complexed to the p101 regulatory subunit and signals downstream of gpcrs and ras  which is activated by  subunits from gpcrs  such as the receptors for chemokines . despite limitations in selectivity  
 the two commercially available pi3k inhibitors  wortmannin and ly294002  have contributed greatly to our understanding of the biological role of pi3k in lung inflammation . moreover  previous study indicated that intratracheal administration of ly294002 significantly reduced ovalbumin-(ova- ) induced increases in total cell counts  eosinophil counts  and il-5  il-13  and ccl11 ( eotaxin ) levels in bal fluid and dramatically inhibited ova - induced tissue eosinophilia and airway mucus production . 
 this study confirmed that ly294002 markedly attenuated ova - induced serine phosphorylation of akt  a direct downstream substrate of pi3k . 
 in addition  other studies also showed that ly294002 and wortmannin attenuated eosinophilic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in a murine asthma model . 
 thus  pi3k inhibition was indicated to have therapeutic potential for the treatment of asthmatic airway inflammation . 
 ly294002 was shown to reduce chemokine - induced ros generation in phagocytes  which was further confirmed by studies using pi3k knockout mice . 
 it was also reported that serum withdrawal ( sw ) killed human u937 blood cells by elevating cellular ros levels  which occurred through pi3k activation . 
 thus  pi3k family plays a prominent role in various airway and lung inflammation ( figure 2 ) . 
 moreover  inhibitors of pi3k / akt may prove to be useful novel therapies in the treatment of respiratory diseases . 
 sfks are signaling enzymes that have long been recognized to regulate critical cellular processes  such as proliferation  survival  migration  and metastasis . 
 src protein tyrosine kinase ( ptk ) family is categorized into nonreceptor tyrosine kinases and consists of nine members . 
 src  fyn  yes  and yrk are ubiquitously expressed  whereas blk  fgr  hck  lck  and lyn are expressed in more restricted patterns . 
 src ptk family members are activated in response to the stimulation of a variety of cell surface receptors  such as tyrosine kinase receptors  integrin receptors  and g protein - coupledreceptors  and by cellular stress . 
 moreover  we reported that tnf- or il-1 induces vcam-1 and icam-1 expression via a c - src - dependent pathway in human airway smooth muscle cells . 
 in addition  c - src has been shown to regulate cox-2/pge2/il-6-dependent airway inflammation via nadph oxidase / ros . in human lung 
 epithelial cells  in addition to activating nf-b - inducing kinase ( nik ) via traf2  tnf- could activate c - src through pkc . systemic inhibition of these kinases using specific small molecule inhibitors for src ptks ( either pp2 or su-6656 ) significantly attenuated lps - induced lung injury and capillary permeability and reduced lps - dependent cytokine and chemokine levels in the lung and the serum . 
 thus  the role of src family ptks in inflammatory responses is a rising area of research ( figure 2 ) . 
 however  application of small chemical inhibitors to effectively and specifically block src ptks could have a great clinical implication for airway and lung diseases with inflammatory responses as underlying mechanisms . 
 cell - surface tyrosine kinases receptors play pivotal roles in development  tissue repair  and normal cellular homeostasis . 
 aberrant expression or signaling patterns of these receptors have also been linked to the progression of a diversity of diseases  including asthma . 
 two major families of tyrosine kinases receptors  the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) and platelet - derived growth factor receptor ( pdgfr ) families  have received a great deal of attention as potentially therapeutic targets for respiratory diseases  as these receptors have been shown to play key roles in chronic tissue remodeling in asthma  bronchitis  and pulmonary fibrosis . 
 the egfr system on epithelial cells and underlying mesenchymal cells ( fibroblasts  myofibroblasts  and smooth muscle cells ) drives numerous phenotypic changes during the progression of these pulmonary diseases  including mesenchymal cell hyperplasia  differentiation  and ecm production . the pdgfr system  located primarily on mesenchymal cells  transduces signals for cell survival  growth  and chemotaxis . 
 the variety of egfr and pdgfr ligands produced by the airway epithelium or adjacent mesenchymal cells allows for intimate epithelial - mesenchymal cell communication . in humans 
  the airway epithelium expresses egfr ligands constitutively  including egf  tgf-  hb - egf  amphiregulin  heregulin  and betacellulin . 
 expression of several egfr ligands has also been investigated in diseases  such as copd and asthma . 
 showed that p. aeruginosa bacterial supernatant induces mucin production in human airway epithelial cells ( nci - h292 ) via egfr activation . 
 multiple studies have also reported that stimulation of airway epithelial cells by lps induces the secretion of il-8 via a cellular cascade involving a tlr4/myeloid differentiation primary response gene ( myd)88/nf-b - dependent pathway . 
 in addition  ros have been shown to stimulate pdgfr activation via c - src family kinases . 
 there is accumulating evidence that pkc - dependent phosphorylation of p47 is essential for pdgf - stimulated ros generation  which is important for pdgf - induced mapks activation . 
 taken together  these studies suggest that growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors may also play a key role in mediating expression of inflammatory genes ( figure 2 ) . 
 mapks are important components of signaling modules activated by neurotransmitters  cytokines  and growth factors  as well as chemical and mechanical stressors . in the airway  
 these external signals produce acute responses that modify smooth muscle contraction and may also induce chronic responses that modify airway structure . both acute and chronic events in airway remodeling result from altered expression of multiple genes encoding protein mediators of cell - cell signaling  ecm remodeling  cell cycle control  and intracellular signaling pathways . in mammals  
 three groups of mapks have been identified : the extracellular signal - regulated protein kinases ( erks )  the c - jun nh2-terminal kinases ( jnks )  and the p38 mapk . 
 the p38 mapk is activated by cellular stresses  including uv radiation  lps  growth factors  and cytokines . 
 the jnk is activated by many of the same stimuli that activate p38 mapk  such as cellular stresses and numerous cytokines . 
 thus  the inhibition of mapks activity via pharmacological or genetic approaches blocks allergic inflammation of airways . moreover  asthmatic patients demonstrated increased immunostaining for phospho ( p)-erk  p - p38 mapk  and p - jnk . 
 the phosphorylation of p38 mapk was primarily observed in the basal layer of the columnar epithelium . 
 it is likely that p38 mapk drives basal metabolic processes for this particular cell type . 
 there was significant correlation between clinical severity of asthma and intensity of immunostaining for p - erk and p - p38 mapk and between p - erk and the number of tissue eosinophils and neutrophils in the airways . 
 early studies of p38 mapk demonstrated that il-1 and tnf- activate the p38 mapk in monocytes . 
 furthermore  inhibition of the p38 mapk pathway was shown to exert anti - inflammatory effects through inhibition of il-1  il-6  and tnf- expression . in airway smooth 
 muscle cells  there is solid evidence that both erk and p38 mapk pathways contribute to il-1-induced cox-2 expression and pge2 synthesis [ 76  77 ] . in a mouse model of chronic lung inflammation ( allergic inflammation )  
 significant inhibition of tnf-  il-4  il-13  and rantes ( regulated on activation  normal t - cell expressed and secreted ) in lung homogenates was observed with jnk inhibitor  sp600125 . in addition  we also found that lta or il-1 could induce cpla2  cox-2  or mmp-9 in human airway smooth muscle cells or a549 cells [ 3  44 ] . 
 therefore  mapks play an important role in mediating airway and lung inflammation ( figure 2 ) . 
 nf-b is viewed as a master regulator of inflammatory responses because it plays an essential role in the evolution as well as the resolution phase of inflammation . 
 nf-b controls a wide spectrum of biological effects ranging from immune and stress - induced responses to cell fate decisions such as proliferation  differentiation  tumorigenesis  apoptosis  and tissue remodeling . 
 nf-b usually exists as a heterodimeric complex of p50 and p65/rela subunits . in unstimulated cells  
 nf-b is found in the cytoplasm as an inactive non - dna - binding form  associated with an inhibitor protein called inhibitory b ( ib ) which masks the nuclear translocation signal and so prevents nf-b from entering the nucleus . upon cell stimulation with various nf-b inducers 
  ib is rapidly phosphorylated on two serine residues  which targets the inhibitor protein for ubiquitination by the e3 ubiquitin - ligases ( e3rsib ) and subsequent degradation by the 26s proteasome . 
 the released nf-b dimer can then be translocated into the nucleus and activate target genes by binding with high affinity to b elements in their promoters . 
 nf-b is activated by numerous extracellular stimuli  including cytokines such as tnf- and il-1  viruses and environmental particulates ( pm10s )  and oxidative stress . 
 exogenous h2o2 also activated nf-b in a murine model of ros - induced acute lung injury . 
 administration of otc ( l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate ) resulted in significant reduction of nf-b translocation into the nucleus and expression of adhesion molecules  chemokines  and cytokines . 
 previous study demonstrated that nf-b activation occurred rapidly in the ovalbumin ( ova ) model of allergic airways disease and that nf-b activation predominantly occurred in the epithelial cells of the conducting airways  in association with enhanced mrna expression of nf-b - regulated chemokine genes  including mip-2 and eotaxin . 
 a novel cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor ( bai ) has been shown to downregulate tnf--induced expression of cell adhesion molecules by inhibition of nf-b activation in human pulmonary epithelial cells . 
 recently  we also demonstrated that overexpression of ho-1 protects against tnf--mediated airway inflammation by downregulation of tnfr1-dependent oxidative stress and nf-b activation . 
 taken together  these results show that nf-b plays a key role in mediating the expression of inflammatory proteins in airway and lung inflammation and injury ( figure 2 ) . 
 ap-1 transcription factor typically consists of combinations of jun ( c - jun  jun b  jun d ) and fos proteins ( c - fos  fos b  fra-1  fra-2 )  which bind to the promoters of target genes . 
 it was found to be responsible for the transcriptional activation of various genes that were activated by phorbol esters ( such as pma ) via activation of pkc . 
 ap-1 may be activated via pkc and by various cytokines  including tnf- and il-1  via several types of ptk and mapks  which themselves activate a cascade of intracellular kinases . 
 certain signals rapidly increase the transcription of the fos gene  resulting in increased synthesis of fos protein . 
 other signals lead to activation of kinases that phosphorylate c - jun  resulting in increased activation . 
 specific jun and fos kinases are now recognized and may play a key role in the regulation of cellular responsiveness to cytokine signals . 
 recent studies showed that sirtuin 1 ( sirt1 ) directly interacted with c - jun and repressed the transcriptional activity of ap-1  thus decreasing mmp-9 expression . 
 more recently  it was reported that sirt1 decreased c - fos / c - jun acetylation induced by p300 and inhibited the transcriptional activity of ap-1 and subsequent cox-2 expression and pge2 generation . 
 thus  ap-1 may play a critical role in mediating expression of various inflammatory proteins . 
 there is evidence for increased expression of c - fos in epithelial cells in asthmatic airways  and many of the stimuli relevant to asthma that activate nf-b will also activate ap-1 . 
 thus  ap-1 is also a key factor in respiratory diseases ( figure 2 ) . 
 kinase pathways have become recognized as key cellular signal transducers  and several protein kinase inhibitors are in development for the treatment of respiratory diseases . 
 the pyridinylimidazole compounds  exemplified by sb203580  were originally prepared as inflammatory cytokine synthesis inhibitors that subsequently were found to be selective inhibitors of p38 and  mapk . 
 sb203580 was shown to attenuate bal tnf- production in an ovalbumin challenged rat model of asthma   and sb2439063 reduced neutrophilia and mediator expression in rat copd models . 
 in addition  a recent study also indicated that in acute and chronic animal models of asthma  sp600125 ( a jnk inhibitor ) reduces bal accumulation of eosinophils and lymphocytes  cytokine release  serum ige production  and smooth muscle proliferation after repeated allergen exposure . 
 intratracheal administration of ly294002 reduced ova - induced increases in total cell counts  eosinophil counts  and il-5  il-13  and ccl11 ( eotaxin ) levels in bal fluid and dramatically inhibited ova - induced tissue eosinophilia and airway mucus production . 
 inhibition of sfks using specific inhibitors for src ptks ( either pp2 or su-6656 ) attenuated lps - induced lung injury and capillary permeability and reduced lps - dependent cytokine and chemokine levels in the lung and the serum . 
 rnai is the process of sequence - specific  post - transcriptional / transcriptional gene silencing through small interfering rna ( sirna ) . 
 rnai is a popular method of controlling gene expression and has a potential in the development of drugs for several diseases  such as various types of cancer and viral infections . 
 gene therapy for asthma has already been developed and has demonstrated promising results in animal models . 
 recent progress in delivering sirna to the respiratory system has also improved the therapeutic feasibility of rnai for asthma . 
 in the context of allergic immune responses  activation of stat6 is pivotal for th2-mediated ige production and development of airway inflammation and hyperreactivity . 
 moreover  stat6 sirna has been shown to inhibit allergic airway inflammation and hyperreactivity in mice . 
 inflammatory airway and lung diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation and oxidant / antioxidant imbalance  a major cause of cell damage / injury . 
 numerous studies have shown the effectiveness of polyphenols in limiting the progression of chronic diseases . 
 this is likely to occur  at least in part  because of the antioxidant capacity of these molecules  which extends from the availability of hydroxyl groups and the presence of conjugated double bonds . 
 resveratrol has been reported to increase antioxidant capacity and reduce various markers of oxidative stress . 
 recently  lee et al . indicated that resveratrol inhibits the activation of nf-b ( p65 ) by tnf- or pma and reduces atp - induced mucin secretion from cultured primary rat tracheal surface epithelial ( rtse ) cells . 
 on the other hand  edaravone ( 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one )  a novel radical scavenger protects neurons by reducing endothelial injury and by ameliorating neuronal damage caused by brain ischemia . 
 treatment of edaravone decreases interstitial edema and inflammatory cell infiltration as well as prevents the process of pulmonary fibrosis . 
 in addition  reports of clinical benefit in airway and lung diseases for increased vitamins c and e and other dietary antioxidants have been varied . 
 indicated that vitamin e treatment prior to injury largely prevents the increase in pulmonary permeability index and moderates the increase in lung lymph flow  increases the pao2/fio2 ratio  ameliorates both peak and pause airway pressure increases  and decreases plasma conjugated dienes and nitrotyrosine . 
 erdosteine is a thiol antioxidant having mucoactive properties and the ability to reduce bacterial adhesiveness . 
 this compound was introduced as a mucolytic agent for the treatment of chronic airway and pulmonary diseases . 
 erdosteine breaks the disulfide bonds of mucus glycoproteins  affecting the physical properties of the mucus  thus leading to increased cough clearance . 
 in addition  erdosteine has been reported to have antioxidant  anti - inflammatory  and antibacterial activity . 
 negro et al . showed that erdosteine at a dose of 600  mg / day proved effective in significantly reducing ros levels in peripheral blood of stable copd patients who are current smokers  together with reduction in levels of some chemotactic proinflammatory cytokines ( il-6 and il-8 ) in their bronchial secretions . 
 recently  greene and gaughan represent new therapeutic targets and medicines that target specific micrornas ( mirnas ) and may have potential in the treatment of asthma . 
 there have been a number of studies in the field of mirna that implicate specific mirnas in the pathophysiology of asthma . 
 for example  studies using mouse models have identified mirnas that are altered in response to allergen challenge . 
 certain mirnas that are involved in the regulation of il-13 and the th2 response  key components of the asthmatic response  have been shown to be amenable to modulation by pre - mirs and anti - mirs . 
 other studies have identified mirnas that are implicated in bronchial smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness and proliferation . 
 thus  developing mirna - based medicines to treat the pulmonary manifestations of asthma could yield therapeutics with new properties that have the potential to treat both the inflammation and hyperresponsiveness associated with this disease . 
 there is an increasing evidence that inflammatory proteins  such as vcam-1  icam-1  cpla2  cox-2  and mmp-9 are involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases  such as asthma and copd ( figure 3 ) . 
 moreover  various inflammatory signaling pathways  including pkcs  nadph oxidase / ros  egfr  pdgfr  c - src  pi3k / akt  mapks  ap-1  and nf-b  are involved in the regulation of these inflammatory proteins ( figure 3 ) . 
 further exploration of the role of vcam-1  icam-1  cpla2  cox-2  and mmp-9 in these highly prevalent diseases is crucial to identify which are possible therapeutic targets . 
 the development of new inhibitors that are highly specific but have no major adverse effects is essential . as targeted delivery of inflammatory proteins inhibitors 
 directly to the airway and lung might result in fewer side effects  this option should also be explored . 
 although the use of inhibitors of inflammatory signaling pathways in the treatment of respiratory diseases seems very attractive  further studies are needed to identify the exact role of inflammatory signaling molecules in these diseases and to develop highly specific inhibitors .","


Abstract:
In respiratory diseases, increased expression of various inflammatory proteins, including cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, contributes to airway and lung inflammation. The regulation of inflammation and immune cell differentiation by chemokines is well known, and many inflammatory target proteins are associated with different stimuli. Understanding the mechanisms involved in inflammatory signaling could lead to the development of more effective anti-inflammatory treatments for respiratory diseases.

Research and Discussion:
Respiratory diseases can be triggered by environmental factors that enter the lungs through the airways or the circulation. The intensity and duration of inflammatory responses are regulated by various signaling molecules, such as SFKs, PKC, growth factor receptors, and other pathways. These signaling molecules also control the expression of key inflammatory molecules involved in respiratory diseases. Understanding these mechanisms can pave the way for the development of targeted treatments for airway and lung inflammation.

Results and Conclusion:
Inflammation in respiratory diseases is regulated by a complex network of signaling molecules, which control the expression of key inflammatory proteins like MMP-9, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, COX-2, and cPLA2. Manipulating these signaling pathways could potentially lead to the development of anti-inflammatory drugs specifically targeted to respiratory diseases. By further investigating the mechanisms involved in inflammation, we can potentially identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of respiratory diseases."
"polycystic liver disease is a condition characterized by the presence of multiple cysts in the liver  which may be inherited or sporadic  and most cases of adult polycystic liver disease ( apld ) are related to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( adpkd ) . in 1964  
 there have been some reports  till date  that describe the association of malignant neoplasms with potter type iii cystic disease of the liver and kidney [ 2  3  4  5  6  7  8 ] ; however  most of these describe pancreatic and hepatobiliary neoplasms arising in patients with polycystic liver and kidney diseases including adpkd  and no report has described the association of gastric carcinoma with potter type iii cystic disease of the liver and kidney . 
 this is the first case report of multiple gastric carcinomas associated with potter type iii cystic disease of the liver  mesenterium and kidney . 
 although it is unclear whether the development of multiple gastric carcinomas is directly associated with the pathogenesis of multiple cysts in the liver  mesenterium and kidney  this case provides a perspective for etiology of gastric carcinoma with polycystic disease . 
 he had been receiving hemodialysis treatment 3 times a week for 2 years because of chronic renal failure due to polycystic kidneys . 
 he stated that his sister had suffered from polycystic kidney disease . physical examination on admission revealed distended abdomen due to polycystic disease . 
 the patient had high serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen ( 7.9 ng / ml ) and carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 ( 202 mg / dl ) . 
 an abdominal computed tomography scan showed multiple cysts in the liver and cystic lesions on both sides in the kidney and mesenterium ( fig . 
 gastrointestinal fiberscopy showed the presence of two ulcerated lesions in the lesser curvature in the middle and lower portions of the stomach . 
 histopathological analysis of the gastric tumor biopsy specimens revealed papillary adenocarcinoma in one tumor and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in another . 
 distal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection was performed  and the gastric tumors were surgically diagnosed to be t2n1m0  stage ii  according to the tnm classification for gastric carcinoma . 
 macroscopic examination showed that two tumors of type ii were present in the middle and lower portions of the stomach ( fig . 
 the distal lesion was diagnosed as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma ( 38  39  6 mm ) within the muscularis propria  with marked lymphatic invasion ( ly2 ) and vascular invasion ( v2 ) ( fig . 
 3b ) ; the lesion on the proximal side was diagnosed as a papillary adenocarcinoma ( 58  47  6 mm ) within the submucosal layer  with marked lymphatic invasion ( ly2 ) and vascular invasion ( v1 ) ( fig . 
 adpkd is the most common of all inherited renal cystic diseases and has various external manifestations  including cysts in the pancreas  seminal vesicles  arachnoid membrane  and liver . 
 the most accepted among them is the osathanondh and potter system that was established in 1964  according to which polycystic kidneys are classified into three types . 
 the cysts may be present in any portion of the nephron or tubule  but they are most commonly found in bowman 's space and the angle of the loop of henle . in the older classification  
 potter type iii cystic disease was considered to represent adult - type polycystic disease of the kidney . in 1972  
 they also observed cysts in the liver and/or pancreas in 58 of these patients ; hence  they described this condition as potter type iii polycystic disease . in the present case  computed tomography and ultrasonography scans showed multiple renal and hepatic cysts in addition to multiple cysts in the mesenterium . 
 therefore  according to hatfield and pfister 's criteria  we considered that this case of association of apld with multiple renal cysts could be classified as potter type iii cystic disease . 
 the patient stated that his sister had suffered from polycystic kidney disease ; however  we could not confirm the presence of a family history of polycystic kidney disease because his sister had been out of contact for long . in the absence of a family history of adpkd  bilateral multiple renal cysts with hepatic cysts  together with the absence of other manifestations suggesting a different renal cystic disease  provide evidence for diagnosis . in these instances  
 a family history  however  may be absent in 2040% of new patients in whom the diagnosis of adpkd first is suspected from imaging studies  which can be due to a de novo mutation of pkd-1 or pkd-2 genes . although we could not confirm the mutation of pkd-1 or pkd-2 in this case  family history  clinical findings and imaging studies suggested that the patient suffered from adpkd . 
 reports on the association of malignant neoplasm with apld and adpkd ( potter type iii cystic disease ) are extremely rare . 
 to our knowledge  only 8 such cases have been reported in the english language literature ( table 1 ) [ 2  3  4  5  6  7  8 ] . till date  most cases of neoplasms associated with polycystic disease of the liver and kidney have been reported as either pancreatic or hepatobiliary neoplasms  namely 5 cases of pancreatic neoplasms and 3 cases of cholangiocarcinoma . since 5 of these cases were pancreatic neoplasms  we think that adpkd has some genetic influence on the development of pancreatic neoplasms . 
 aziz et al .   reported 2 patients from the same family ( a brother and a sister ) with adpkd who developed adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction ; however  these patients did not have cysts in the liver or other organs except for the kidney . in the present case  although a detailed family history could not be obtained  multiple cysts were observed in the liver  both kidneys  and mesenterium . 
 these genes encode a member of the polycystin protein family  which is an integral membrane protein that functions as a regulator of calcium - permeable cation channels and intracellular calcium homoeostasis . 
 some studies have described an association between the pkd genes and cancer cells ; polycystin-1  encoded by pkd-1  was reported to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the g0/g1 phase in cancer cells . moreover 
  pkd-1 inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion and may be considered a new member of the tumor suppressor family of genes . 
 therefore  adpkd  which is caused by defective pkd-1 and pkd-2  may be a carcinogenic condition . 
 in addition  mutations in two genes  namely prksch ( which codes for hepatocystin ) and sec63  have been found to cause apld . however  as mutations in these genes have not been found in all families  undiscovered genes responsible for causing apld probably still exist . 
 although it is unclear whether the development of multiple gastric carcinomas is directly associated with the pathogenesis of cysts in the liver  mesenterium and kidney  the present case demonstrates that gastric carcinoma can be an external complication in patients with polycystic disease .

1) Abstract: This case report describes a 65-year-old man with chronic renal failure and a family history of polycystic kidney disease who developed multiple gastric carcinomas associated with potter type III cystic disease of the liver, mesenterium, and kidney. Helicobacter pylori infection was not detected, and the patient underwent hemodialysis treatment. This is the first reported case of this rare association and we review other malignant neoplasms associated with polycystic disease. 

2) Research and Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of the association of gastric carcinoma with potter type III cystic disease of the liver and kidney. There is a lack of literature on the link between malignant neoplasms and potter type III cystic disease, and we discuss potential underlying mechanisms for this rare association. More research is needed to understand the possible relationship between these two conditions. 

3) Results and Conclusion: In this case, we report the association of multiple gastric carcinomas with potter type III cystic disease of the liver, mesenterium, and kidney. Our findings suggest that patients with chronic kidney disease and a family history of polycystic kidney disease may have an increased risk of developing gastric malignancies. Clinicians should be aware of this potential association and regularly monitor patients with these conditions for early detection and prompt management. Further studies are needed to explore this rare link."
"canaliculitis is a common encounter in ophthalmic practice but supernumerary puncta and canaliculi ( spc ) are rare congenital disorders . in a large series 
 a 59-year - old gentleman presented with painful swelling of the left lower lid for a week  which was associated with epiphora . 
 the swelling was confined to the nasal aspect of the left lower lid ( 0.50.5 mm ) with inflamed overlying skin ( figure 1a ) . 
 eversion of the lower eyelid revealed two puncta  0.5 mm apart ( figure 1b ) . 
 the outer punctum was situated at the normal anatomical position ; whereas the inner punctum in the caruncle . gentle pressure did not result in any regurgitation from the both puncta . 
 the patient was treated with oral cloxacillin 500 mg  6 hourly for 5 days . 
 the outer punctum had a soft stop with regurgitation of fluid from the same punctum . 
 the outer punctum - canaliculus system was a cul - de - sac ( figure 1c ) . 
 c ) dacryocystography showed pooling of dye in the cul - de - sac ( white arrow ) . 
 c ) dacryocystography showed pooling of dye in the cul - de - sac ( white arrow ) . 
 most spcs ( 78% ) present with epiphora . among the 23 patients reported by satchi et al .  none presented with canaliculitis . 
 sequestration of tear and debris in the cul - de - sac served as nidus for infection . the resultant canaliculitis with its surrounding edema caused obstruction of the lacrimal drainage ; hence epiphora . 
 epiphora however  may develop despite patent lacrimal drainage system . the 2-compartment model for lacrimal canalicular drainage of kakizaki et al . 
  suggested that the muscle of duverney - horner may deviate normal flow within the accessory canaliculus and thence transport tears back to the lacrimal tear lake  leading to epiphora . 
 a solid epithelial cord forms in the region of the medial lower eyelid ( figure 2a ) and sends projections to form the canaliculi and the nasolacrimal duct ( figure 2b ) . 
 spc is due to extra out - budding of the solid epithelial cord ( figure 2c ) . 
 canalization begins at 4 months of gestation with disintegration of the central ectodermal core  forming lacrimal drainage outflow system . in this case  the extra inner canalicular epithelial bud ( nearer to the main epithelial cord ) underwent complete canalization and remained connected to the main epithelial cord . 
 the outer canalicular epithelial bud  although its punctum is located at the normal anatomical position  was separated from the main epithelial cord ; forming a cul - de - sac ( figure 2d ) .

1) Abstract: This case reports a unique presentation of canaliculitis associated with supernumerary puncta and canaliculi. The 59-year-old patient presented with a painful left lower lid swelling and epiphora. Treatment with oral antibiotics resulted in resolution of symptoms within three days.

2) Research and Discussion: The first documented case of supernumerary puncta and canaliculi leading to canaliculitis is presented. The embryological origins of this anomaly are discussed as well as the pathomechanism underlying canaliculitis. Oral antibiotics were an effective treatment for this patient.

3) Results and Conclusion: The patient's presentation and response to treatment highlights the importance of considering supernumerary puncta and canaliculi as a potential cause of canaliculitis. Further research is needed to better understand the prevalence and management of this rare anatomical anomaly. Early recognition and appropriate treatment can lead to resolution of symptoms in these cases."

"diabetes imposes a large economic burden on the individual  national healthcare systems  and countries.[15 ] healthcare expenditures due to diabetes account for 11% of the total healthcare expenditures in the world in 2011 . 
 estimated global healthcare expenditures to treat diabetes and prevent complications totaled $ 465 billion in 2011 . by 2030  
 this number is projected to exceed some $ 595 billion . on average  the estimated healthcare spending due to diabetes 
 was $ 5063 per person with diabetes in high - income countries compared with $ 271 in low- and middle - income countries . 
 worldwide  the estimated number of adults living with diabetes has soared to 366 million  representing 8.3% of the global adult population . 
 this number is projected to increase to 552 million people by 2030  or 9.9% of adults  which equates to approximately three more people with diabetes every 10 or almost 10 million per year.[78 ] the kingdom of saudi arabia is not exception of this global pandemic . over the past four decades 
 the ageing of populations  together with rapid socio - economic development ( progressive urbanization  decreasing infant mortality and increasing life expectancy ) and tremendous changes in lifestyle towards the westernized pattern reflected by changes in nutrition  less physical activity  tendency to increased obesity and more smoking  has resulted in the dramatic increase in the diabetes prevalence.[916 ] worldwide  the desire of many healthcare players ( governments  diabetes associations  health professionals  health economists  and people with diabetes themselves ) to reduce the economic burden of diabetes and its related complications costs makes the question of economic impact of diabetes an important component in : 
 determining the present economic burden of diabetes and its related complications on government healthcare systempredicting the likely future economic burden of diabetes and its related complications  anddeveloping effective policies and strategies about treatment of diabetes and its related complications and the future public health spending related diabetes healthcare costs . determining the present economic burden of diabetes and its related complications on government healthcare system predicting the likely future economic burden of diabetes and its related complications  and developing effective policies and strategies about treatment of diabetes and its related complications and the future public health spending related diabetes healthcare costs . 
 the purpose of this research study  therefore  is to determine the economic impact of diabetes mellitus ( dm ) on saudi arabia 's healthcare system  both now and in the future . 
 this research study  however  focuses on the prevalence of diabetes and aims at estimating and predicting the total and per capita healthcare expenditure for people diagnosed with diabetes . 
 to examine and predict the economic impact of diabetes costs on saudi arabia 's healthcare system  this study relied on data provided by ministry of health ( moh ) and ministry of finance ( mof ) for the years 1992 and 2010 databases.[1921 ] the 1992 and 2010 time period is used as the study time frame . 
 population figures from the 1992 and 2010 moh databases for patients who reported that they had diabetes were selected for this study . 
 data on government budget  total healthcare budget  and per capita health expenditure were obtained directly from the moh and mof databases . data on population ( by nationality  sex and age groups ) with undiagnosed diabetes obtained directly from central department of statistics and information databases . 
 it should be noted that this study is based on single - source of diabetic data ( moh database ) only ; therefore  it does not account for the considerable number of people diagnosed with diabetes in other healthcare providers such as private and semi - private healthcare services ( military  universities  arabian american oil company ( aramco ) healthcare services  etc . ) . 
 consequently  diabetes prevalence is probably much higher than figures presented in this study because a significant number of people diagnosed with diabetes are not included in the analysis . 
 it should also be noted that the perspective adopted in this study is that of the moh . 
 if other perspective were used such as payer  society or health care provider  the results would be different . 
 in addition  data on diabetes was obtained from moh database is based on diabetic clinics visits in both moh hospitals and healthcare centers  and it combined in- and out - diabetic - patients which is categorized by nationality ( saudi / non - saudi ) ; sex ( male / female ) ; and age groups ( < 1 ; 1 - 4 ; 5 - 14 ; 15 - 44 ; 45 - 60 ; and 60 + ) . 
 it should be noted that  it is not clear whether data provided by the moh database is based on first visits related to diabetes . therefore  it is not certain whether diabetic data is protected from double counting or not . 
 this research study used prevalence - based approach that combines the demographics of the population with and without diagnosed diabetes in 1992 and 2010 . the general principle for estimating the healthcare costs of diabetes is straightforward.[2427 ] 
 healthcare use attributable to diabetes is determined by a comparison of the healthcare use patterns of individuals with and without diabetes . 
 dividing healthcare expenditures by the size of the population with and without diabetes provides an estimate of per capita healthcare expenditures.by multiplying diabetes population figures by the per capita healthcare expenditures  the total healthcare budget for people diagnosed with diabetes is derived.assuming diabetes prevalence rates remained constant over time  the exponential projection method ( i.e.  annualized change ) is used to reflect the growing prevalence of diabetes in the saudi arabia and the increasing costs of healthcare expenditures over the next 10 years ( i.e.  2020 ) . healthcare use 
 attributable to diabetes is determined by a comparison of the healthcare use patterns of individuals with and without diabetes . 
 dividing healthcare expenditures by the size of the population with and without diabetes provides an estimate of per capita healthcare expenditures . by multiplying diabetes population figures by the per capita healthcare expenditures 
  the total healthcare budget for people diagnosed with diabetes is derived . assuming diabetes prevalence rates remained constant over time  the exponential projection method ( i.e.  annualized change ) is used to reflect the growing prevalence of diabetes in the saudi arabia and the increasing costs of healthcare expenditures over the next 10 years ( i.e.  2020 ) . 
 it should be mentioned that  the modern approach to conducting cost - of - illness studies is based on system of health account ( sha ) approach . 
 sha is used to describe the health care system from an expenditure perspective . however  as there is no sha in saudi arabia  other approaches had to be used . 
 knowledge of the costs of diabetes improves understanding of the importance of addressing healthcare and prevention issues associated with diabetes and help to inform and motivate decisions that can reduce the national burden of this disease . 
 based on the moh database approximately 0.9 million people in 1992 and 2.5 million people in 2010 have been diagnosed with diabetes . 
 analysis of the 1992 - 2010 moh database suggests that the number of people diagnosed with diabetes increased by 1.6 million ( or 183% ) during the last 18 years . 
 this increases the proportion of the total population with diabetes from 5.3% in 1992 to 9.3% in 2010 . 
 comparison of the 2010 diabetes figure to the 1992 figure suggests that the net number of people diagnosed with diabetes is growing by about 0.1 million per year . this increased prevalence of diabetes over the period of study is not only attributable to changing pattern of saudi lifestyle due to rapid socio - economic development ( together with increased obesity  smoking and less physical activities ) but may also be attributed to increased awareness programs related to diabetes and its health complications  community screening campaigns for diabetes  better diagnostic facilities specially in health centers and healthcare units  and better diabetes management systems and protocols . 
 in fact  several community - based screening campaigns studies for dm and hypertension were conducted in different parts of saudi arabia revealed that quite a large percentage of these participants ( diabetic patients ) were not detected and remain for a long time without significant symptoms . 
 these studies concluded that community - based screening campaigns are extremely efficient in identifying undiagnosed diabetic and hypertensive individuals in the society.[2933 ] table 1 summarizes the demographic component of population diagnosed with diabetes . 
 the moh database for population diagnosed with diabetes by nationality  sex  and age - group  suggests that saudi citizens comprised 84% and 96% of total population diagnosed with diabetes in 1992 and 2010  respectively  while  non - saudi population diagnosed with diabetes comprised 16% in 1992 and about 4% in 2010 . 
 the demographic analysis also revealed that over half of total population diagnosed with diabetes  in 1992 and 2010  are males while females represented about 47% and 48% of total population diagnosed with diabetes in 1992 and 2010  respectively . 
 the analysis revealed that about 1 in 11 males being diabetic in 2010 as compared with 1 in 19 males in 1992 . 
 for females  about 1 in 9 were diabetic in 2010 compared with 1 in 17 in 1992 . 
 population ( in millions ) and percent of population with and without diabetes  1992 and 2010 the population between 45 and 60 years represented the highest among population diagnosed with diabetes during the period of analysis . 
 this age group comprised about 52% and 45% of total population diagnosed with diabetes in 1992 and 2010  respectively  with remaining population under age 15  age 15 - 44  and 60 years and above comprised about 3%  21%  15% in 1992 and about 4%  27%  24% in 2010  respectively . 
 it is important to mention that the population age 60 years and above represents the highest percentage increase among population diagnosed with diabetes during the last 18 years of analysis . 
 the population of age 60 years and above diagnosed with diabetes is growing by more than 33.6 thousand people per year . 
 the analysis revealed that the ratio of population of age 60 years and above diagnosed with diabetes to with undiagnosed diabetes rose from ( 1:4 ) in 1992 to almost ( 1:1 ) in 2010 . 
 it is well documented that the population with the highest use of healthcare resources attributed to diabetes is the population aged 60 years and above.[3438 ] healthcare expenditure attributed to diabetes reflects the additional expenditures the nation incurs because of diabetes . 
 this equals to the total healthcare expenditures for people with diabetes minus the projected level of expenditures that would have been incurred in the absence of diabetes . in effect 
  this is estimates the excess healthcare use that is theoretically due to ( or caused by ) diabetes and its related complications . 
 the term  attributed  also means the difference in healthcare use for people with diabetes compared with what their healthcare use would be in the absence of diabetes . 
 approximately $ 0.9 billion in healthcare expenditures is incurred by people with diabetes  reflecting $ 1 of every $ 11 moh healthcare dollars . 
 healthcare expenditures incurred by people with diabetes increased by more than 500% during the last 18 years . in 2010 on average  people diagnosed with diabetes have medical healthcare expenditures that are ten times higher ( $ 3686 vs. $ 380 ) than what expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes ( $ 1 us dollar = 3.75 saudi riyal ) . 
 healthcare expenditures by diabetes status  nationality  sex  and age groups  1992 and 2010  ( in usa dollars ) dividing total attributed healthcare expenditures by the number of people diagnosed with diabetes  gives an estimate of the average annual excess expenditures for the population under age 15  age 15 - 44  age 45 - 60  and age 60 and above at $ 9244  $ 1255  $ 767  and $ 1442  respectively . 
 the population between age 45and 60 has the highest per capita healthcare expenditure during the last 18 years . per capita 
 expenditure for population between age 45 and 60 increased by more than 145% between 1992 and 2010  followed by age 15 - 44 ( 137% )  under age 15 ( 45% )  and age 60 years and above ( 36% ) . 
 the analysis revealed that the per capita healthcare expenditure for the population under age 15 is almost nine times higher ( $ 9244 vs. $ 1048 ) than healthcare expenditures of otherwise similar age group without diabetes . 
 the analysis also revealed that the per capita healthcare expenditure for the population between age 15 and 44 is two times higher ( $ 1255 vs. $ 590 ) than healthcare expenditures of the otherwise similar age group without diabetes . per capita 
 healthcare expenditure for male / female population diagnosed with diabetes is equal ( to some extent ) to the per capita healthcare expenditure of male / female population without diabetes . 
 similarly  per capita for saudi citizens diagnosed with diabetes is to some extent equal to per capita for saudi citizens with undiagnosed diabetes . while  per capita healthcare expenditure for non - saudi population is eight times higher ( $ 8589 vs. $ 1018 ) than healthcare expenditures of non - saudi nationality without diabetes . as mentioned earlier  
 the rapid increase of socio - economic development in saudi arabia coupled with improved living standards and technological advancements during the last four decades has resulted in dramatic change of saudi lifestyle . over - nutrition  
 increasing obesity and smoking rate  and less physical activity and many other factors reflecting the substantial increase in the size of saudi population diagnosed with diabetes.[4045 ] these factors are likely to remain  and if diabetes prevalence rates remained constant over time  then the number of people diagnosed with diabetes is expected to rise by 4.2 million in 2015 and by another seven million by 2020 . 
 the economic burden of diabetes on saudi arabia is expected to be approximately $ 2.4 billion in 2015 [ table 3 ] . 
 this is an increase of $ 1.5 billion  or nearly three times the level in 2010  this cost is also expected to rise by another $ 6.5 billion in 2020 . 
 given the expected increase in the number of people diagnosed with diabetes in saudi arabia  the proportion of public healthcare spending is expected to escalate from 9.3% in 2010 to 13.1% in 2015 and to 18.3% by 2020 . 
 projection of population with diagnosed diabetes and their healthcare expenditure  ( in usa dollars ) the actual economic burden of diabetes in future years is expected to be higher if the cost of health care outpaces the overall cost of living  or if the growing problem of obesity increases the prevalence rate diabetes . 
 even so  such estimates do not account for the lost productivity and losses attributable to pain and suffering incurred by people diagnosed with diabetes  as well as to families and friends of those with diabetes . 
 based on the moh database approximately 0.9 million people in 1992 and 2.5 million people in 2010 have been diagnosed with diabetes . 
 analysis of the 1992 - 2010 moh database suggests that the number of people diagnosed with diabetes increased by 1.6 million ( or 183% ) during the last 18 years . 
 this increases the proportion of the total population with diabetes from 5.3% in 1992 to 9.3% in 2010 . 
 comparison of the 2010 diabetes figure to the 1992 figure suggests that the net number of people diagnosed with diabetes is growing by about 0.1 million per year . this increased prevalence of diabetes over the period of study is not only attributable to changing pattern of saudi lifestyle due to rapid socio - economic development ( together with increased obesity  smoking and less physical activities ) but may also be attributed to increased awareness programs related to diabetes and its health complications  community screening campaigns for diabetes  better diagnostic facilities specially in health centers and healthcare units  and better diabetes management systems and protocols . 
 in fact  several community - based screening campaigns studies for dm and hypertension were conducted in different parts of saudi arabia revealed that quite a large percentage of these participants ( diabetic patients ) were not detected and remain for a long time without significant symptoms . 
 these studies concluded that community - based screening campaigns are extremely efficient in identifying undiagnosed diabetic and hypertensive individuals in the society.[2933 ] table 1 summarizes the demographic component of population diagnosed with diabetes . 
 the moh database for population diagnosed with diabetes by nationality  sex  and age - group  suggests that saudi citizens comprised 84% and 96% of total population diagnosed with diabetes in 1992 and 2010  respectively  while  non - saudi population diagnosed with diabetes comprised 16% in 1992 and about 4% in 2010 . 
 the demographic analysis also revealed that over half of total population diagnosed with diabetes  in 1992 and 2010  are males while females represented about 47% and 48% of total population diagnosed with diabetes in 1992 and 2010  respectively . 
 the analysis revealed that about 1 in 11 males being diabetic in 2010 as compared with 1 in 19 males in 1992 . 
 for females  about 1 in 9 were diabetic in 2010 compared with 1 in 17 in 1992 . 
 population ( in millions ) and percent of population with and without diabetes  1992 and 2010 the population between 45 and 60 years represented the highest among population diagnosed with diabetes during the period of analysis . 
 this age group comprised about 52% and 45% of total population diagnosed with diabetes in 1992 and 2010  respectively  with remaining population under age 15  age 15 - 44  and 60 years and above comprised about 3%  21%  15% in 1992 and about 4%  27%  24% in 2010  respectively . 
 it is important to mention that the population age 60 years and above represents the highest percentage increase among population diagnosed with diabetes during the last 18 years of analysis . 
 the population of age 60 years and above diagnosed with diabetes is growing by more than 33.6 thousand people per year . 
 the analysis revealed that the ratio of population of age 60 years and above diagnosed with diabetes to with undiagnosed diabetes rose from ( 1:4 ) in 1992 to almost ( 1:1 ) in 2010 . 
 it is well documented that the population with the highest use of healthcare resources attributed to diabetes is the population aged 60 years and above.[3438 ] 
 healthcare expenditure attributed to diabetes reflects the additional expenditures the nation incurs because of diabetes . 
 this equals to the total healthcare expenditures for people with diabetes minus the projected level of expenditures that would have been incurred in the absence of diabetes . in effect 
  this is estimates the excess healthcare use that is theoretically due to ( or caused by ) diabetes and its related complications . 
 the term  attributed  also means the difference in healthcare use for people with diabetes compared with what their healthcare use would be in the absence of diabetes . 
 approximately $ 0.9 billion in healthcare expenditures is incurred by people with diabetes  reflecting $ 1 of every $ 11 moh healthcare dollars . 
 healthcare expenditures incurred by people with diabetes increased by more than 500% during the last 18 years . in 2010 on average  people diagnosed with diabetes have medical healthcare expenditures that are ten times higher ( $ 3686 vs. $ 380 ) than what expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes ( $ 1 us dollar = 3.75 saudi riyal ) . 
 healthcare expenditures by diabetes status  nationality  sex  and age groups  1992 and 2010  ( in usa dollars ) dividing total attributed healthcare expenditures by the number of people diagnosed with diabetes  gives an estimate of the average annual excess expenditures for the population under age 15  age 15 - 44  age 45 - 60  and age 60 and above at $ 9244  $ 1255  $ 767  and $ 1442  respectively . 
 the population between age 45and 60 has the highest per capita healthcare expenditure during the last 18 years . per capita 
 expenditure for population between age 45 and 60 increased by more than 145% between 1992 and 2010  followed by age 15 - 44 ( 137% )  under age 15 ( 45% )  and age 60 years and above ( 36% ) . 
 the analysis revealed that the per capita healthcare expenditure for the population under age 15 is almost nine times higher ( $ 9244 vs. $ 1048 ) than healthcare expenditures of otherwise similar age group without diabetes . 
 the analysis also revealed that the per capita healthcare expenditure for the population between age 15 and 44 is two times higher ( $ 1255 vs. $ 590 ) than healthcare expenditures of the otherwise similar age group without diabetes . per capita 
 healthcare expenditure for male / female population diagnosed with diabetes is equal ( to some extent ) to the per capita healthcare expenditure of male / female population without diabetes . 
 similarly  per capita for saudi citizens diagnosed with diabetes is to some extent equal to per capita for saudi citizens with undiagnosed diabetes . while  per capita healthcare expenditure for non - saudi population is eight times higher ( $ 8589 vs. $ 1018 ) than healthcare expenditures of non - saudi nationality without diabetes . 
 as mentioned earlier  the rapid increase of socio - economic development in saudi arabia coupled with improved living standards and technological advancements during the last four decades has resulted in dramatic change of saudi lifestyle . over - nutrition  
 increasing obesity and smoking rate  and less physical activity and many other factors reflecting the substantial increase in the size of saudi population diagnosed with diabetes.[4045 ] these factors are likely to remain  and if diabetes prevalence rates remained constant over time  then the number of people diagnosed with diabetes is expected to rise by 4.2 million in 2015 and by another seven million by 2020 . 
 the economic burden of diabetes on saudi arabia is expected to be approximately $ 2.4 billion in 2015 [ table 3 ] . 
 this is an increase of $ 1.5 billion  or nearly three times the level in 2010  this cost is also expected to rise by another $ 6.5 billion in 2020 . 
 given the expected increase in the number of people diagnosed with diabetes in saudi arabia  the proportion of public healthcare spending is expected to escalate from 9.3% in 2010 to 13.1% in 2015 and to 18.3% by 2020 . 
 projection of population with diagnosed diabetes and their healthcare expenditure  ( in usa dollars ) the actual economic burden of diabetes in future years is expected to be higher if the cost of health care outpaces the overall cost of living  or if the growing problem of obesity increases the prevalence rate diabetes . 
 even so  such estimates do not account for the lost productivity and losses attributable to pain and suffering incurred by people diagnosed with diabetes  as well as to families and friends of those with diabetes . 
 diabetes is a personal crisis for people living with the disease  and for their families . 
 treatment of the disease and its related complications are consuming an ever - larger share of healthcare budgets  and will soon force a tremendous increase in those budgets . 
 although the population diagnosed with diabetes comprises more than 9% of the saudi population in 2010  almost 1 in 11 people in saudi arabia having diabetes  and if the present prevalence rate remains unchanged over time  the ratio of people with to without diabetes will increase by almost 1 in 5 people having the disease in 2020 . 
 people diagnosed with diabetes have medical healthcare expenditures that are ten times higher than what expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes . 
 this cost is estimated to be $ 6.5 billion by 2020 reflecting an increase of $ 5.6 billion ( or 7 times higher than the cost in 2010 ) within the next 10 years or so . 
 although  the diabetes cost estimates presented in this research study might be conservative for several reasons : 
 omitted from this analysis due to data limitations is the number of people who reported that they had diabetes in both private and other governmental ( e.g. universities hospitals  armed forces medical services  security forces hospital  national guard medical services  royal commission hospitals  youth welfare hospital  now saudi aramco ) healthcare service providers . at the time of writing in 2012  there are 148 hospitals and about 2360 health clinics not related to moh healthcare system . 
 this research study relied only on data obtained directly from the moh healthcare database on people diagnosed with diabetes and ignored other sources of data due to difficulty in obtaining them . 
 consequently  diabetes prevalence is probably much higher than figures presented in this study because a significant number of cases are not included in the analysis.omitted from the cost estimates is the indirect cost associated with diabetes such as lost productivity due to disease - related absenteeism  unemployment due to disease - related disability  lost productivity due to early mortality by disease as well as the social cost of intangibles such as pain and suffering and care provided by non - paid caregivers . 
 the prevention programs targeted to people with diabetes  research activities  and administration costs associated with diabetes are also omitted for the diabetes cost estimates in this study . 
 if a portion of these costs were attributed to diabetes  the national healthcare cost of diabetes would be billions of dollars higher than what the estimate suggest in this study.sensitivity analysis related diabetic mellitus and its related complications were not carried out in this study .

 sensitivity analysis related diabetic mellitus and its related complications were not carried out in this study . 
 worldwide  resources allocated to diabetes prevention and treatment  are growing  but prevalence is also growing steadily . 
 several international reports on preventing dm indicated that people with diabetes are at greater risk of neurological disease  peripheral vascular disease  cardiovascular disease  renal disease  endocrine / metabolic complications  ophthalmic disease  and other chronic complications compared with individuals without diabetes.[18 ] chronic complications are the main cause of death among diabetic patients and account for the higher costs in hospitalization and drugs  and the costs of drugs for these complications are 2.5 times higher than those for the general population . 
 these international reports suggested that better access to preventive healthcare system  more widespread diagnosis  more intensive disease management  and the advent of new medical technologies could significantly eliminate or reduce the health problems caused by diabetes . 
 these factors could also improve the quality of life for people with diabetes and their families  while at the same time potentially reduce national expenditures for healthcare services and increasing productivity in the national economy . to sum up  
 further research studies are needed to improve our understanding of economic costs of diabetes and its substantial burden to saudi healthcare system . 
 special attention should also be given to the role of diabetic awareness programs  community - based screening campaigns and different health educational programs in reducing health problems caused by diabetes  which in the long run  helps to reduce the national burden of this disease . 
 sha should also be adopted by saudi health providers to deal with these developments of financial health flows related to the consumptions of healthcare goods and services .","

1) Abstract: This study examines the economic burden of diabetes on the Saudi healthcare system using a prevalence-based approach, combining population demographics with and without diagnosed diabetes in 1992 and 2010. Results show a significant impact on healthcare expenditures and suggest that indirect costs are likely underestimated. 

2) Research and Discussion: The economic burden of diabetes is a major concern for individuals, healthcare systems, and countries. Through secondary sources, the study found that persons with diabetes have healthcare expenditures ten times higher than those without. However, the study did not account for indirect costs, such as lost productivity and caregiver costs. 

3) Results and Conclusion: Based on the study, it is estimated that diabetes imposes a cost of $0.87 billion on the Saudi healthcare system. However, this is likely an underestimate due to the exclusion of indirect costs and intangibles. Further research is needed to fully understand the economic impact of diabetes and its complications, and potential strategies to alleviate this burden."
"the prospective study of pravastatin in the elderly at risk ( prosper ) was a prospective multicenter randomized placebo - controlled trial to assess whether treatment with pravastatin diminishes the risk of major cardiovascular events in the elderly ( 1213 ) . between december 1997 and may 1999

 all participants were interviewed at home and visited the research center for further examinations . in prosper  
 fasting glucose levels were assessed at baseline in 5599 of the 5804 participants . of the 5599 participants  580 did not have all cognitive function tests available at baseline . 
 all of the resulting 5019 participants had full data available for other cardiovascular risk factors including bmi  systolic and diastolic blood pressure  and hdl cholesterol levels at baseline . 
 this resulted in a study sample of 5019 participants for prosper . in the rotterdam study  
 fasting glucose levels were assessed at the third survey in 3795 participants . of these participants

 there were 4690 of the 5019 participants in the prosper sample and 2364 of the 3428 participants in the rotterdam sample who underwent at least one additional measurement of fasting glucose level in addition to the initial examination . 
 these data were used to study the variability of the fasting glucose levels over time and to assess the appropriateness of using a single baseline fasting glucose measurement to assess the relationship between fasting glucose and cognitive function and decline . at baseline  history of diabetes was defined by self - reported history of diabetes ( reporting the use of oral antidiabetes medication  the use of insulin  treatment by diet  or registration by a general practitioner as having diabetes ) in both study samples . 
 in addition  a dedicated neuropsychological test battery was used to assess executive function and memory . 
 executive function was assessed with the letter  digit substitution task ( ldst ) ( 16 ) and the abbreviated stroop test part 3 ( 17 ) in both studies  as well as with the word fluency test ( wft ) ( 18 ) in the rotterdam study only .

 table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the total sample and for participants with a history of diabetes at baseline ( prosper ) or at the third survey ( rotterdam study ) . in prosper  the fasting glucose levels 
 sd differed among the three countries from which the participants were enrolled : scotland 5.62  1.27  ireland 5.09  1.34 )  and the netherlands 5.76  1.64 mmol / l . 
 this resulted in a lower mean fasting glucose level for the prosper study sample compared with that of the rotterdam study sample . 
 participants with a history of diabetes had a higher fasting glucose level  bmi  and systolic blood pressure and lower levels of hdl cholesterol compared with participants without a history of diabetes . 
 * fasting insulin levels were available for 3342 participants in the rotterdam study . in prosper  
 fasting glucose levels were assessed during follow - up after 3  6  12  24  and 36 months  in addition to the baseline assessment . in 3491 participants without a history of diabetes  fasting glucose levels were available at baseline and after 36 months of follow - up .

 figure 1a shows the relationship between fasting glucose levels and cognitive function at baseline for the 8447 participants of the merged study sample . 
 study - specific quintiles of the distribution of fasting glucose levels in participants without a history of diabetes were constructed to account for the differences in fasting glucose levels between the studies . 
 cognitive test scores are shown for quintiles of the distribution of fasting glucose levels in participants without a history of diabetes and for participants with a history of diabetes . in participants without a history of diabetes  a rise in fasting glucose levels in the nondiabetes range was not associated with impairment in cognitive function  for any of the cognitive tests . additionally  we compared the cognitive test scores at baseline for participants with and without a history of diabetes ( fig . 
 1a ) and showed that participants with a history of diabetes had worse cognitive function across the majority of tests at baseline when compared with participants without a history of diabetes ( p < 0.05 for all tests except for the wft in the rotterdam study sample ) . 
 z scores ( sem ) for different cognitive test scores are plotted for study - specific quintiles of fasting glucose levels in nondiabetic participants ( from lowest [ quintile 1 ] to the highest [ quintile 5 ] levels of fasting glucose ) and for participants with a history of diabetes ( dm ) . 
 p values reflect the trend over the quintiles of fasting glucose levels  as well as the difference between participants without a history of diabetes ( n = 7592 ) and participants with a history of diabetes ( n = 855 ) . 
 estimates are based on the maximum number of participants available per cognitive test : global cognitive function ( n = 8447 )  wft ( n = 3518 )  and 12-plt ( n = 5223 ) . 
 z scores ( sem ) represent annual change in cognitive test scores for study - specific quintiles of fasting glucose levels in nondiabetic participants ( from lowest [ quintile 1 ] to the highest [ quintile 5 ] levels of fasting glucose ) and for participants with a history of diabetes .

 higher levels of fasting glucose were associated with a decreased rate of decline on the 12-plt ( ptrend = 0.039 )  but this was not seen for any of the other cognitive tests . 
 furthermore  participants with a history of diabetes did not show an increased rate of decline for any of the cognitive tests . additionally  we assessed the relationship between insulin resistance and cognitive function and decline for the 3342 participants of the rotterdam study sample for whom fasting insulin levels were available ( fig . 
 the homa that was calculated for these participants was correlated with the fasting glucose levels ( r = 0.54  p < 0.001 )  although the overlap between quintiles of the homa index and quintiles of fasting glucose levels was limited : only 35% of the participants without a history of diabetes were in the same quintile of the distribution for both fasting glucose and homa index . 
 the relationship between insulin resistance and cognitive function was in accordance with findings on fasting glucose levels and cognitive function : in participants without a history of diabetes  rising insulin resistance was not associated with cognitive function . 
 similarly  there was no clear relationship between levels of insulin resistance and change in cognitive function during follow - up ( fig . 
 when the data from the prosper sample and the rotterdam study sample were analyzed separately  the findings were consistent with the results of the merged sample of 8447 participants . a : insulin resistance ( homa ) and cognitive function in the rotterdam study . z scores ( sem ) for different cognitive test scores are plotted for quintiles of insulin resistance ( homa ) in nondiabetic participants ( from lowest [ quintile 1 ] to the highest [ quintile 5 ] levels of insulin resistance [ homa ] ) and for participants with a history of diabetes ( dm ) . 
 p values reflect the trend over the quintiles of fasting glucose levels  as well as the difference between participants without a history of diabetes ( n = 3039 ) and participants with a history of diabetes ( n = 303 ) . 
 estimates are based on the maximum number of participants available per cognitive test : global cognitive function ( n = 3342 ) and wft ( n = 3424 ) . 
 z scores ( sem ) represent annual change in cognitive test scores for quintiles of insulin resistance ( homa ) in nondiabetic participants ( from lowest [ quintile 1 ] to the highest [ quintile 5 ] levels of insulin resistance [ homa ] ) and for participants with a history of diabetes . 
 p values reflect the trend over the quintiles of fasting glucose levels  as well as the difference between participants without a history of diabetes ( n = 2331 ) and participants with a history of diabetes ( n = 203 ) . 
 estimates are based on the maximum number of participants available per cognitive test : global cognitive function ( n = 2534 ) and wft ( n = 2567 ) . 
 linear mixed models were used  adjusted for age  sex  level of education  bmi  hdl level  systolic blood pressure  and diastolic blood pressure . 
 our study shows that  in an unprecedented large number of individuals from two independent prospective studies  higher levels of fasting glucose in the absence of a history of diabetes are not associated with cognitive function or cognitive decline . 
 furthermore  there was no association between insulin resistance ( homa index ) and cognitive function and decline in people without a history of diabetes . 
 however  participants with a history of diabetes did have worse cognitive function at baseline than those without diabetes  although the magnitude of the observed effects was relatively small . the results of our analyses do not fully correspond with previous findings in the rotterdam study  in which diabetes was found to be related to an increased risk of developing dementia ( 22 ) . although our data show that those with a history of diabetes have worse cognitive function at baseline than those without  one could argue that the effect sizes are lower than expected based on the previous report of an almost twofold increased risk of dementia for people with diabetes ( 22 ) . 
 it is possible that the measurement of cognitive function compared with the assessment of participants with dementia in the rotterdam study underlies this discrepancy . in the rotterdam study 
  we are able to continuously monitor the total cohort for incident dementia through computerized linkage between the study database and digitalized medical records from the general practitioners and the regional institute for outpatient mental health care . 
 in contrast  in the rotterdam sample  cognitive function assessments were performed with a 4.6-year interval  which could have led to selective nonparticipation of those in whom dementia was diagnosed between cognitive examinations ( n = 85 ) and did not visit the research center for the follow - up assessment . 
 furthermore  a previous report from the nurses ' health study showed that higher insulin levels in nondiabetic participants were related to faster cognitive decline ( 23 ) . 
 these results are not in agreement with our results on the relationship between insulin resistance and cognitive decline in the rotterdam study sample . 
 the prolonged length of follow - up ( > 10 years compared with 4.6 years ) in the nurses ' health study could have affected these results  as the effect of insulin resistance on cognitive function might be long - term . 
 on the other hand  results from the ongoing memory in diabetes ( mind ) substudy of the action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes ( accord ) trial showed that higher a1c but not fasting plasma glucose levels was associated with worse cognitive function in a sample of almost 3000 participants ( 24 )  which is in line with our results . in individual participants  diabetes and impaired fasting glucose levels often co - occur with other cardiovascular risk factors . 
 the metabolic syndrome is seen as a clustering of a number of these risk factors ( abdominal obesity  hypertriglyceridemia  low hdl cholesterol  hypertension  and hyperglycemia ) and is the subject of an ongoing discussion on the clinical use of the syndrome and its individual components in establishing the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes ( 25 ) . 
 other studies have suggested a relationship between the metabolic syndrome and the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia ( 2628 ) . in our study  the clustering of these factors of the metabolic syndrome with the fasting glucose levels could have influenced our results . 
 however  adjustment for bmi  systolic and diastolic blood pressure  and hdl cholesterol did not differ from the analyses that were unadjusted for these covariates . 
 furthermore  the participants in prosper were included based on their increased cardiovascular risk profile : having either preexisting vascular disease or increased risk of such disease due to a history of smoking  hypertension  or diabetes . 
 the known association between these cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive function and decline might have interfered with our investigation of the relationship between fasting glucose levels and cognitive function and decline . however  
 when we excluded the 2823 participants in prosper who had a history of vascular disease from the sample of 5019 participants  the relationship between fasting glucose levels and cognitive function at baseline did not markedly differ from our findings in the total sample : there was no clear relationship between fasting glucose levels and cognitive function in participants without a history of vascular disease . 
 moreover  after exclusion of the 2823 participants  there was no significant relationship anymore between history of diabetes and baseline global cognitive function . 
 the relationship between fasting glucose levels and change in cognitive function did not markedly change after exclusion of the participants with a history of vascular disease . 
 the same was seen for the analyses on the relationship between history of diabetes and change in cognitive function . 
 therefore  we do not think that the inclusion of participants with preexisting vascular disease in prosper has masked a possible association between fasting glucose and insulin resistance on cognitive function . 
 we used fasting insulin levels that were available for almost the entire sample of the rotterdam study to calculate the homa index as a measure of insulin resistance to further investigate the relationship between glucose metabolism and cognitive function . 
 however  the relationship between insulin resistance and cognitive function and decline showed similarities with the association between fasting glucose levels and cognitive function and decline : in participants without a history of diabetes  insulin resistance was not associated with cognitive function or decline . 
 previous population - based studies that investigated the relationship between glucose metabolism and cognitive functions suggested a number of possible biological mechanisms that could be involved  ranging from accumulation of advanced glycation end products ( 2 ) and accelerated cerebrovascular disease ( 1 ) to the role of the insulin - degrading enzyme on amyloid  metabolism ( 3 ) . 
 although it is difficult to address the role of these suggested mechanisms  our study of > 8000 participants shows that the effect of increased fasting glucose levels on cognitive function seems to be long - term and independent of other cardiovascular risk factors like bmi  blood pressure  and hdl cholesterol levels . 
 the observed differences in cognitive test scores between people with and without a history of diabetes were relatively moderate and may therefore lack clinical significance for individuals . 
 however  small effect sizes do not automatically imply irrelevance of the observed effect  as small effects on the group level can indeed represent large effects for a number of participants . in the analyses of the annual decline in cognitive function  
 the prosper sample failed to show a clear decline in mmse score over time  although this was seen in the rotterdam sample with participants of comparable age . 
 it is possible that a potential learning effect of the mmse had a higher impact on the prosper sample compared with the rotterdam study sample because of the shorter time span between cognitive measurements ( 19 ) . 
 additionally  the selection criteria for participants in prosper ( baseline mmse score  24 ) may have resulted in a sample of participants with slightly better cognitive function  which is also represented in the difference in mmse scores of both samples at baseline and might have had an effect on the annual decline of mmse score that was measured in prosper . 
 the strengths of this study consist of the prospective design  the large number of participants in both studies  and the dedicated neuropsychological test battery that was used in both samples . 
 furthermore  we had the possibility of studying the variability of fasting glucose levels during follow - up and of examining the appropriateness of using a single measurement of fasting glucose level to assess the association between fasting glucose levels and cognitive function and decline . 
 a large variation in fasting glucose levels over time could have disturbed our analyses through the phenomenon of  regression - to - the - mean . 
 however  the levels of fasting glucose during follow - up did not materially differ from the baseline or third survey in both study samples . 
 therefore  we decided to use the baseline or third survey fasting glucose measurement in our analyses . 
 participants who were present at baseline but did not undergo follow - up examinations were predominantly present in the group with a history of diabetes . 
 they had worse cognitive function at baseline compared with the participants who stayed in the study until the end of follow - up . 
 this selective attrition of participants with relatively high levels of fasting glucose and concurrent low levels of cognitive function could have resulted in an underestimation of our estimates of cognitive decline for participants with a history of diabetes . 
 we also recognize that some individuals with diabetes would have been missed because of lack of oral glucose tolerance testing . 
 more importantly  undiagnosed diabetes would be more prevalent in those in the higher quintiles for fasting glucose and would have biased the study toward an association of higher quintiles and cognitive decline  not the other way around . 
 thus  lack of oral glucose tolerance testing does not negate our findings ; rather it gives us added confidence that our observations are valid . in conclusion  elevations in fasting glucose levels are not clearly associated with impaired cognitive function or with an accelerated rate of cognitive decline in participants without a history of diabetes . 
 furthermore  there was no clear relationship between insulin resistance ( homa index ) and cognitive function and decline in participants without a history of diabetes . 
 these data suggest that cognitive decline accelerates strongly once a person is diabetic but not with lesser degrees of dysglycemia . as a result  
 preventing individuals at risk from developing diabetes through lifestyle changes may also lead to large societal gains by preventing such individuals from undergoing accelerated cognitive decline .

Abstract:
Objective: To investigate the relationship between fasting glucose levels, insulin resistance, and cognitive impairment in old age. 

Research and Discussion:
Diabetes is associated with cognitive impairment in older people, but the link between elevated fasting glucose levels and insulin resistance in nondiabetic individuals and cognitive impairment is unclear. Data from two prospective studies show no significant relationship between fasting glucose levels or insulin resistance and cognitive function or decline in individuals without a history of diabetes.

Results and Conclusion:
Subjects with diabetes had impaired cognitive function at baseline, but no consistent association was found between baseline fasting glucose levels or insulin resistance and cognitive function or decline in individuals without diabetes. These findings suggest that there may be a threshold for the effects of dysglycemia on cognitive function, or that other factors contribute to cognitive impairment in individuals with diabetes. "
"as mentioned in the report of the national eye institute  dry eye is a disorder of the tear film due to tear deficiency or excessive tear evaporation  which causes damage to the interpalpebral ocular surface  and is associated with symptoms of ocular discomfort . since contact lenses disrupt the integrity of the tear film and thin out the lipid layer  thus increasing tear evaporation  they can potentially cause symptoms of eye dryness in wearers . 
 .   found that ocular dryness affects 20% of wearers of new - generation silicone hydrogel contact lenses  as well as 24% of wearers of older - generation  low - oxygen permeable ( phema ) lenses . 
 brennan and efron   found that 75% of low - oxygen permeable lens wearers report a feeling of discomfort at the end of the day related to dry eye . 
 in general  it is believed that more than 50% of contact lens wearers are symptomatic of dry eye . 
 they may also present with clinical signs of dryness  such as damage to the surface of the eye  as well as instability and/or hyperosmolarity of the tear film ; however  the symptoms do not always correlate with the objective signs . in all of these cases 
  the subject develops discomfort in the absence of any ocular pathology that could trigger the dryness . 
 all other factors being discarded  the contact lens wear must therefore be considered as the most likely etiology of the subject 's symptoms .    subjects with induced ocular dryness by contact lens wear usually tend to drop out from this modality when the benefits of the lenses are outweighed by the discomfort they feel  especially during the last hours of wear  day after day . 
 this is the main reason why 20% of low - oxygen permeable lens wearers and 13% of silicone hydrogel lens   wearers stop wearing contact lenses every year . 
 this discontinuation rate represents a continuous loss for the industry and for eyecare professionals  and the quest to find new methods to prevent induced dryness of the ocular surface is an ongoing concern . 
 manufacturers first tried to deal with the materials used for contact lenses . among other things  comfort depends on a given material 's rate of on - eye dehydration [ 711 ]  wettability [ 12  13 ]  and the presence of surface deposits [ 810 ] . 
 silicone hydrogel lenses are currently considered to be the material of choice compared with hydrogels . 
 clinically  while many benefits [ 14  15 ] are recognized  studies have shown that silicone hydrogel lenses have not altered end - of - day discomfort  as described above  at least not as expected  with the exception of senofilcon a  which was found to improve comfort in adverse and challenging environments .    when materials proved not to be a solution to the problem of dry eye  researchers turned their attention to the lens design ( spherical versus aspherical )  the edge profile ( sharp and thin versus rounded and thicker )  the fit of the lens on the eye ( flat or steep )  and the replacement rate ( 2 weeks versus 1 month ) . on many of these aspects  
 care products were also considered as triggering ocular dryness symptoms because they are chemical products that are known to cause short- and medium - term toxic and allergic reactions  leading to patient discomfort . 
 preservatives have been identified as the main components of these products that can trigger these reactions among contact lens wearers [ 1822 ] . 
 it is also known that specific biocides found in contact lens solutions can be related to toxic and allergic reactions that produce more severe symptoms in wearers . 
 accordingly  solutions containing polyhexanides  specifically polyaminopropyl biguanide ( papb ) and polyhexamethylene biguanide ( phmb )  are known to increase the potential for adverse reactions . 
 polyhexanides are polycationic agents with a relatively high molecular weight  which  in theory  should limit their absorption by the contact lens . 
 however  studies have shown that certain materials can easily absorb a large quantity of polycationic agents during the lens soaking phase ( at night ) . 
 other factors that can explain this absorption are the number and the nature of buffers in the solution and the presence of sodium chloride which determines the ionic strength of the lens - solution interaction . 
 on insertion  the lens balances out with the surrounding ocular environment  and the biocides absorbed by the lens matrix are released into the eye  possibly contributing to a temporary alteration of the ocular surface  especially during the first four hours of wear . 
 absorption and release rates vary depending on the agents and materials used  and not their surface treatment  which determines compatibility between certain solutions and certain materials . 
 for example  aldox penetrates more than phmb and is released more rapidly ( between 0 and 60  min ) into the eye after insertion of the contact lens . 
 this has prompted certain authors to suggest that wearers neutralize the polycationic agents ( such as phmb ) absorbed during soaking by adding a drop of anionic   solution to the lenses before insertion . 
 the anionic - cationic reaction creates a chemically neutral environment  sparing the cornea from temporary structural changes during wear . 
 this has been proven to contribute to increased patient comfort  even at the end of the day . 
 the simple use of a lubricant in the morning would therefore significantly improve end - of - day symptoms by creating a chemically neutral environment in the cornea from the outset  thus eliminating the potential for toxic or allergic reactions . 
 the only agent that has been tested in this regard and that has confirmed this hypothesis is carboxymethyl cellulose ( cmc )  an anionic polymer found in certain lubricants ( refresh  allergan  irivne  ca ) . 
 cmc is a water - soluble synthetic cellulose derivative with marked hydrophilic and bioadhesive properties that promote faster repair of the eye surface . 
 this study aims to evaluate the performance of sodium hyaluronate ( sh ) in the same way . 
 in fact  it is believed that the use of this product  instilled in the lens  before insertion  would chemically neutralize the biocide effects on the ocular surface  helping to alleviate initial and long - term discomfort associated to contact lens wear . 
 sh is a viscoelastic agent used in several eye care products  both topically and in surgery  to protect and maintain the integrity of ocular tissues . 
 sixty - four patients were recruited among 4 optometric offices in the greater montreal area  each of them being selected as representative of an average optometric practice in north america  based on the number and type of patients seen . 
 one optometrist per office was designated and appropriately trained to conduct the study  in order to maximize the interobserver agreement rate . 
 training and coordination of the study were the responsibility of l'cole d'optomtrie de l'universit de montral . 
 regular contacts by email or phone were maintained during the study between the university coordinator ( lm ) and the associate researchers . 
 this study received approval from the ethics committee for health sciences of universit de montral . 
 inclusion and exclusion criteria of subjects are listed in table 1 . after being enrolled  
 subjects were asked to observe a wash - out period of 72 hours without contact lenses before the beginning of the study . 
 subjects had to be established wearers  for at least 3 months  of the silicone hydrogel lenses ( comfilcon a - coopervision  fairport  ny ) . 
 subjects were then randomly assigned to four groups ( a  d )  based on the care regimen to be used for the length of the study a : complete ( amo - abbott  irvine  ca ) ; b  opti - free replenish ( alcon  forth worth  tx ) ; c : renu fresh ( b&lomb  rochester  ny ) ; d : clear care ( ciba vision  duluth  ga ) . 
 once recruited  the subject was provided with a new pair of contact lens and the care regimen steps were reviewed  according to the manufacturer 's recommendations . 
 there was only one base curve available for the lens  limiting the customization of the fit . however  every lens fitted had to be centered  to offer a movement of 0.2  mm maximum upon blinking  and did not expose the limbus in any manner  in any gaze . for half of the subjects  they were told to wear the lens for a month  on a daily wear basis  and to not use any drops prior to insertion of the lenses . 
 for the other half  they were told to instill a sodium hyaluronate based comfort drop ( blink contacts  abbott - amo  irvine  ca ) in the lens ( not in the eye )  before insertion . 
 nothing was said to subjects about potential clinical effects of this product not to justify its use before insertion . 
  subjects were seen back for a control exam and assessed .   at the 1-month visit 
  a case history was performed to identify subjects ' level of compliance with the protocol and to answer any questions that might be raised by them . 
 visual acuity was measured using an etdrs high - contrast chart under dim standard illumination . 
 a slit lamp exam was performed to evaluate conjunctival and corneal staining  conjunctival hyperemia  and tear break - up time ( tbut ) . 
 efron 's grading scale was used to evaluate the presence and severity of clinical signs  with grades varying from 0 ( absence ) to 4 ( severe ) . 
 fluorescein was observed using a cobalt blue filter and a yellow filter ( kodak wratten filter number 12 ) to reveal any contrasts . 
 the same filters were also used to evaluate tbut  which is measured 2 times and averaged . 
 the first questionnaire used in this study is the contact lens dry eye questionnaire ( cldeq ) . 
 it consists of 36 questions specific to symptoms of ocular dryness related to contact lens wear . 
 there are nine symptom subscales : discomfort  dryness  visual changes  soreness and irritation  grittiness and scratchiness  foreign body sensation  burning  photophobia  and finally itching . for each of these subscales  any occurrence of the symptom 
 was also evaluated in term of intensity at different times ( 2 hours after insertion  middle and end of the wearing period ) . this questionnaire had already been validated and is sensitive and specific at predicting a diagnosis of dry eye associated with the wearing of contact lenses . 
 in addition to the cldeq questionnaire  subjects were asked to complete a brief survey about their contact lens experience over the last month . 
 this is made through a forced - choice questionnaire where the subject had to click a box to select the best answer . 
 questions of this questionnaire are related to the subjective evaluation of comfort  with the lenses on  at different times of the day ( morning  afternoon  evening ) . 
 subjects have to select from 5 options  from very comfortable ( score of 5 ) to very uncomfortable ( score of 1 ) . 
 the 1-month visit ended with a review of the care regimen procedures with instructions to the subject to wear the lenses for at least 8 hours / day  5 days / week  and not to sleep or take a nap while wearing contact lenses .    a new pair of lenses 
 was then provided and subjects were asked to observe a 48  h00 wash - out period of time  without lenses worn . for the next month  the subjects that did not use sh were asked to put a drop of a sodium - hyaluronate- ( sh- ) based product ( blink contacts  amo - abbott  irvine  ca ) on the lens before insertion . 
 the other ones had to cease to use such a drop . subjects were seen a month later for the final visit  and the same clinical procedures were repeated . 
 the results provided with and without the use of sh drops were considered for comparison .    at the end of the second visit  
 the second questionnaire was slightly different from the first one  with an additional question about which care regimen they would prefer to use in the future ( with or without sh drops ) . 
 one file was rejected due to missing clinical data at one visit ; another one was discarded because the subject admitted to have worn his lenses on an extended - wear basis most of the month . 
 a total of 61 patients completed the study successfully ( 18 males ( 30% ) and 43 females ( 70% ) ) . 
 the mean subject age was 25.0 ( 73 ) years old ( range 1835 ) . at the beginning of the study  subjects reported spending 5 hours / day  on average ( 3 hours at work and 2 hours outside ) on computer work . 
 only 5/61 ( 8.1% ) had received a positive diagnosis of dry eye in the past  while 19 of them ( 31.1% ) self - reported suffering from ocular dryness periodically . some others ( 37 subjects60.6% ) were uncertain on this issue  having had some symptoms in the past . 
 fifteen subjects were assigned to group a  thirteen to group b  seventeen to group c  and sixteen to group d. based on the population sample  characteristics of each group were found to be similar .   for the following  visit 1 ( v1 ) 
 is related to the clinical results obtained when the subject was free of sh drops while visit 2 ( v2 ) represents the results obtained after its usage .   on average  a total of 76 ( 22.00 ) hours of wear / week was estimated at v1 which is slightly less than 81 ( 29.50 ) hours / week for v2 . 
 however  this difference is not considered statistically significant ( t - test  p = 0.12 ) .  
 table 2 shows the results for corneal and conjunctival staining  conjunctival hyperemia  and tear break - up time ( tbut ) . 
 more subjects ( 41 versus 38 ) showed no staining with the use of drops . also  50% fewer subjects showed clinically significant staining ( grades 2 - 3 ) with this usage . 
 the differences on the presence of the corneal staining show a tendency for statistical significance ( f(2122 ) = 0.6323 ; p = 0.05 ) . no care regimen was associated with a significant increase in corneal staining . 
 conjunctival staining ( grade 1 ) was noticed in both temporal and nasal quadrants for 24% of the subjects on visit 1 and 17% on visit 2 . 
 this ocular sign was markedly reduced with the use of sh drop before insertion of the lens . 
 there was an increase of 50% of subjects ( 23 versus 14 ) showing no hyperemia at v2 compared to v1 . 
 clinically significant hyperemia ( grade 2 and over ) was also markedly reduced ( 10 subjects at v1 versus 3 at v2 ) . moreover  a 2/3 reduction in the severity of the hyperemia is observed . 
 this difference is statistically significant ( pearson  f(2122 ) = 3.1217 ; p = 0.04 ; r = 0.0281 ) . 
 overall  the average tear break - up time increased slightly at the second visit from 5.8 ( 3.1 ) sec to 6.3 ( 3.3 ) sec od and from 5.8 ( 3.2 ) sec to 6.5 ( 3.5 ) sec os . 
 this difference is not considered statistically significant ( od p = 02372 ; os p = 01598 ) . on the other hand  when we paired results for the same individual ( subject compared to himself from v1 to v2 )  there was an increase in the tbut value that is considered statistically significant ( tukey - kramer  q = 19801  p = 005 od and q = 19765  p = 005 os ) . 
 finally  visual acuity remained stable during the study ( v1/v2 : od 1.1  ( 0.2)/1.0  ( 0.2 ) ; os 1.1  ( 0.1)/1.0  ( 0.2 ) ) .   from this questionnaire 
  we kept for analysis each symptom that was reported by at least 10% of the subjects  at one visit  intensity of the symptoms was analyzed ( subquestions ) . 
 accordingly  discomfort ( q4 )  dryness ( q5 )  visual changes ( q6 )  soreness and irritation ( q7 )  grittiness and scratchiness ( q8 )  foreign body sensation ( q9 )  burning ( q10 )  photophobia ( q11 )  and itching ( q12 ) were analyzed . 
 grittiness and scratchiness ( q8 )  foreign body sensation ( q9 )  burning ( q10 )  photophobia ( q11 )  and itching ( q12 ) were not reported sufficiently to be considered for further analysis . 
 table 3 shows the results . on average  there was a 10% increase in subjects reporting comfortable or very comfortable wear at the second visit . 
 this difference is considered significant ( chi square  f(461 ) = 5.16 ; p = 0.0353 ; r  =  0.118 ) . 
 this result applies regardless of the care regimen used ( f(661 ) = 4.675 ; p = 0.15 ) . 
 looking at the intensity of this symptom ( table 4 )  a greater difference is found at the beginning of the day  after 2 hours of wear ( p = 0.00 ) . 
 this difference decreases by midday ( p = 0.01 ) and at the end of the day ( p = 0.03 ) but remains statistically significant at every time point . 
 the difference is highly significant ( chi square  f(461 ) = 20.2312  p < 0.00 ) with a strong correlation ( r = 0.3191 )  showing a positive effect from the use of the sh drop  reducing the presence or the intensity of this symptom . 
 in fact  there is a decrease of 20% of subjects reporting this symptom as constant at visit 2 compared to visit 1 . 
 the severity of the symptoms was also analyzed ( cldeq questions 5b  c  and d ) . 
 overall  there is a marked difference in the reduction of the severity of eye dryness felt by the patient ( q5b - chi square f461 :  9.538 ; p = 0.0008 ; r = 0.1847 )  after 2 hours of wear ( q5c - f261 :  2.8366 ; p = 005 ; r = 0.1439 )  and at the end of the wearing time ( q5d - f461 :  11.6696 ; p = 0.00 ; r = 0.1999 ) . 
 there is a respective increase of 13% at 2 hours  8% ( mid - day ) and 14% ( end of the day ) in subjects reporting reduced symptoms on v2 compared to v1 . with the use of sh drop  
 8 out of 10 patients report this symptom as not intense at all .   considering that astigmatism is not in play among study 's subjects ( exclusion criteria )  
 blurry vision is considered to be related to tear film instability and contact lens dehydration . 
 the use of sh drop helps to reduce almost by half the number of subjects experiencing blurry vision during their contact lens wear . 
 sixty percent of subjects in this study reported not feeling that symptom at all  after using sh drop before insertion ( chi square f461 :  13.964 ; p < 0.00 ) . 
 this result shows a strong correlation ( r = 0.2154 ) and is verified the same way in all care system groups . 
 questions 6 b  c  and d provide more details on this issue by asking how noticeable the blurry vision was at different times : after 2 hours ( q6b )  in the middle of the day ( q6c )  and at the end of the wearing period ( q6d ) . 
 there is no statistical difference between subjects at the first two time points ( 6d ) . at the end of the day  
 15% more patients report no symptom with the use of sh drop ( v2 ) ( f461 = 5.4858 ; p = 0.03 )  even after many hours of wear . again  this result is the same with all the care system used  with no significant differences among groups .   at visit 1  
 84.7% of the wearers report this symptom as never or infrequently present while 15.3% report it as frequent or constant . at visit 2  only 5.1% of the wearers still experienced this symptom . 
 this is considered a significant difference in favor of the use of the sh drop ( chi square f161 = 2.1899 ; p = 0.04 ; r = 0.0869 ) . 
 in other words  10% of the subjects experiencing eye soreness and irritation became asymptomatic with the use of a comfort drop on the lens before insertion . 
 this difference was not present after 2 hours of wear ( q7b  p = 0.90 ) but significant in the middle of the day ( q7c  p = 0.00 ) and highly significant at the end of the wearing time ( q7d  p = 0.00 ) . 
 this was again validated across all groups ( a  b  c  d ) . 
 a highly significant difference exists between visit 1 and 2 ( chi square f461 = 14.0198  p < 0.00 )  with a strong correlation ( r = 02463 ) . at v1  21% of the subjects admit removing their lenses many times / week because of discomfort  while only 11% report the same at v2 . 
 this is a 50% reduction of symptomatic patients with the use of a sh - based drop on the lens before insertion . 
 ocular discomfort and ocular dryness were  respectively  the number one and two reasons identified by subjects to explain this need to withdraw their lenses . looking at intensity of these two symptoms  a positive effect of the comfort drop applied before insertion is found . 
 in fact  there is a highly significant difference in the grading of the severity of ocular discomfort and ocular dryness ( q13b  item ( a ) and ( b ) ) between v1 and v2 ( p < 0.00 for each symptom ) . 
 table 9 shows the results . there is a significant difference at every time point  but the most obvious difference is during the evening ( f461 = 10.943 ; p = 000 ; r = 0.1817 ) . 
 we find again here the 10% positive difference in favor of the use of sh drops  confirming the cldeq results . over 
 60% of subjects reported a very comfortable / comfortable lens during the evening  after more than 10 hours of wear  compared with 52% without the use of the drops . 
 this positive effect is already measured in the afternoon with a 7% increase in the number of wearers reporting comfortable instead of average wear . 
 these results indicate that the subjective positive effect from the use of sh drops starts early during the wear and increases over time .   at the last visit  subjects rated the ease of use of the 2 care regimens they used in the past 2 months ( with and without sh drops ) . 
 ninety percent ( 90% ) of the subjects rated as very easy or easy both care regimen  without statistically significant differences . 
 the care regimen used at v1 was rated as easy ( 20% ) or very easy ( 70% )  while the second one  including drops before insertion  was rated easy ( 25% ) or very easy ( 65% ) . 
 when asked  near 9 out of 10 subjects would recommend the care regimen with sh drops ( 58.3% strongly and 30% certainly ) . 
 none of the subjects would not recommend the system ( item 4 and 5 ) . 
 finally  75% of subjects would definitely opt for the system with sh drops in the future ( see figures 2 and 3 ) . 
 this study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcome from the instillation of sh drop  as an additional step in the wearing regimen of contact lens wearers  on contact lens related comfort and visual performance over the day . 
 the cross - over design of the study was established to alleviate hawthorne - like effects as well as sequencing effects . 
 one could argue that the lack of a control group  using another type of lubricating drop  would have been beneficial . even if this is true  we believe that the cross - over design eliminates any bias that can be raised and helps to determine the real effect from the usage of sh drop instilled in the lens before insertion . 
 the results of the present study prove that sodium - hyaluronate - based drops can be added to the list of products that can help symptomatic contact lens wearers to reduce their overall discomfort ( cldeq - q4 )  but especially at the end of the day ( q4 subquestions )  when it matters most . even if the symptoms remain  symptom severity is greatly reduced with the use of sh drops ( cldeq - q5 ) . 
 sh drops also have a positive impact on the subjective visual acuity ( cldeq - q6 ) . 
 there is a significant reduction of blurry vision reported by the subjects on visit 2  which means that the use of sh drops probably helps to maintain tear film stability and also contributes to reduce lens dehydration . 
 we have to consider that blurry vision represents the number 2 reason ( and the first one for astigmatic patients ) to drop out from contact lens wear .    in this study  
 the use of a sh drop initiated a switch for a significant percentage of the wearers from symptomatic to asymptomatic ( eye soreness and irritation ( cldeq - q7 ) ) . 
 for these subjects  discomfort was no longer a reason to remove their contact lenses prematurely ( cldeq - q13 ) . 
 more than 60% of wearers reported remaining comfortable in their lenses during the evening  compared with 50% when they did not use the sh drop before insertion ( comfort questionnaire ) . 
 clinical findings observed through slit lamp were also improved with the use of sh drops on the lens before insertion . it was observed a reduction in the level of corneal staining  whereas clinically significant hyperemia levels were reduced by more than 50% . 
 pairing of the results indicates an improvement of tbut  when subjects are compared to themselves  after the use of the sh drop . 
 these objective findings correlate with subjective reports of increased comfort with the use of sh drops as part of the regular care regimen . 
 they are not surprising considering the nature of the sodium hyaluronate and its known beneficial effects on the ocular surface restoration  namely  on dry eye patients . 
 consequently  we can say that the use of sh drops before insertion helps to address the two major reasons why patients cease to wear contact lens wear ( discomfort and vision ) and contributes to a reduction in the physiological impact from contact lens wear . 
 this is not anecdotal and should represent a significant step forward to keep patients in the contact lens market . 
 it is easy to realize the impact on wearers  practitioners  and the contact lens industry if  with just one easy additional step before lens insertion  it is possible to keep 10% more of the wearers in contact lenses on an ongoing basis and to improve symptoms of others by 50 to 60% . 
 a single drop put on the lens before insertion can considerably change the contact lens experience for subjects who report ocular dryness . 
 noncompliance to this new step is certainly not a big issue : instilling one drop before lens insertion was rated easy by a large majority of subjects and 3 out of 4 of them would recommend this to other wearers or their relatives . 
 it is a well - accepted and easy way to improve contact lens wear . 
 another important aspect of this study is that the positive outcome from the use of sh drops before insertion was verified with multiple types of care systems habitually recommended to wearers . even subjects using a hydrogen peroxide system found a positive effect from the use of sh drop before lens insertion . 
 practitioners  therefore  should not hesitate to recommend this step to their symptomatic wearers in order to improve their overall contact lens experience . 
 a sodium hyaluronate drop before insertion of contact lenses improves the overall comfort but its clinical effect is highly significant at the end of the wearing period  during the evening . 
 its use helps to eliminate or to significantly reduce discomfort symptoms related to contact lens wear and to improve contact lens experience . 
 sh drops also help to maintain more stable vision throughout the day .   because of that  it is possible to say that the use of sh - based drops ( blink contacts ) before insertion addresses the two major reasons why contact lens wearers drop out from the market . 
 the use of sh drops before insertion should be considered to improve overall contact lens performance for symptomatic contact lens wearers .","

Abstract: This study evaluated the effectiveness of sodium hyaluronate-based comfort drops in improving outcomes for symptomatic contact lens wearers. A cross-over, open-label, multi-site study was conducted, with subjects wearing silicone hydrogel lenses for two months. Half of the group instilled sh drops before lens insertion while the other half did the same during the second month. Objective and subjective outcomes were measured and compared before and after using sh drops.

Research and Discussion: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of sh drops on contact lens wearers. Results showed a significant improvement in both objective and subjective outcomes after using sh drops. This suggests that sh drops may provide relief for uncomfortable contact lens wearers and could potentially improve overall satisfaction with lens wear.

Results and Conclusion: The use of sh drops before contact lens insertion was found to have a positive effect on outcomes for symptomatic wearers. However, there was no significant difference between using the drops before insertion versus during the second month. This suggests that sh drops may be effective in providing comfort for contact lens wearers, but further research is needed to determine the most effective timing for use. Overall, sh drops may be a valuable addition to the management of contact lens discomfort. "

Abstract:
Bacterial volatiles play a critical role in protecting plants from fungal pathogens. They can directly inhibit fungal growth or enhance the defense capabilities of plants by triggering induced resistance. Our study found that induced resistance was the primary mechanism for plant protection, accounting for over 90% of the effect. 

Research and Discussion:
The effects of bacterial volatiles on fungal growth were found to be dose-dependent. Low dosages did not inhibit Botrytis cinerea, but were sufficient for inducing resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Bacterial volatiles also inhibited biofilm formation and in planta leaf colonization of B. cinerea. These results highlight the potential of bacterial volatiles as a natural and effective method for plant protection.

Results and Conclusion:
Our study provides valuable insights into the role of bacterial volatiles in protecting plants from fungal pathogens. Induced resistance was found to be the major mechanism responsible for plant protection against B. cinerea. These findings highlight the potential of using bacterial volatiles as a natural and environmentally-friendly alternative to chemical fungicides for plant disease management. "
"surgical intervention for corneal perforation is indicated when the anterior chamber does not reform within a short period of time . 
 herein  we report the successful management of a small paracentral corneal perforation using autologous iris incarceration and tissue adhesive . 
 a 41-year - old man developed a small paracentral corneal perforation ( 0.5 mm in size ) in the right eye  while the treating physician attempted to remove the residual rust ring after removal of a piece of metallic foreign body . 
 the eye was initially managed with a bandage soft contact lens to ameliorate the aqueous leakage ; however  without success . iatrogenic iris incarceration of the wound was first induced  followed by application of cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive to the perforated site . as a result  the anterior chamber was immediately reformed and maintained . 
 cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive with iatrogenic incarceration of the autologous iris was effective in treating this type of small corneal perforation . 
 this technique is simple and potentially useful for small paracentral corneal perforations outside the visual axis and without good apposition . 
 corneal perforation caused by small corneal punctures can sometimes be managed with a bandage soft contact lens  patching  and/or tissue adhesive [ 2  3  4 ] . 
 however  surgical intervention is usually indicated when the anterior chamber does not reform within a short period of time . 
 herein  we report the successful experience of managing a small paracentral corneal perforation without good apposition  which could not be tamponaded by a soft bandage lens only  with iatrogenic iris incarceration followed by cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive . 
 a 41-year - old man noted irritation in the right eye and was diagnosed to have a piece of metallic foreign body in his right cornea . 
 iatrogenic corneal perforation was encountered  while the attending physician attempted to remove the residual rust ring with a corneal burr . 
 slit - lamp examination revealed a paracentral corneal penetration with a diameter of approximately 0.5 mm ( fig . 
 the anterior chamber was flat  and active aqueous leakage was confirmed by a positive seidel test with fluorescein . 
 intravenous antibiotics with cefozopran hydrochloride were initiated  in conjunction with prophylactic topical antibiotic with 0.5% levofloxacin three times daily . 
 after 48 h of treatment  there was no significant improvement in the right eye . 
 concerns were raised about possible complications such as secondary angle closure glaucoma and prolonged hypotony . 
 since the puncture was located paracentrally near the visual axis  simple primary closure of the wound or corneal patch graft was deemed undesirable . 
 as the wound was completely  punched out  injected viscoelastic materials in the anterior chamber came out from the wound  which made it quite difficult to dry the surface of the cornea for application of tissue adhesive . therefore  to provide a necessary support for the gluing  
 amniotic membrane plugging was tried  but it was too slippery to be fixed on the wound . 
 a paracentesis port was created . a blunt 27-gauge needle ( with a 2-mm bent tip ) attached to a viscoelastic injecter 
 was gently inserted into the anterior chamber through the paracentesis . using the bent tip  a small tug of iris 
 care was taken not to touch or injure the corneal endothelium or anterior capsule of the lens . 
 meticulous drying of the wound and incarcerated iris was performed and a tiny amount of ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate adhesive ( aron alpha a ; sankyo co. ltd .  
 attention was paid to ensure that the glue did not spread on to the surrounding cornea . 
 the corneal puncture was thus successfully closed without any sutures  and the anterior chamber remained well formed . 
 postoperatively  the patient was treated with topical 0.1% fluorometholone and 0.5% levofloxacin three times daily . 
 pupillary distortion was observed when the iris was dilated ; however  the patient felt no visual disturbance . 
 herein  we reported a case of iatrogenic paracentral corneal perforation without good apposition successfully treated with autologous iris incarceration and cyanoacrylate adhesive . 
 conventionally  small corneal perforations were treated with stitches with or without corneal patch graft  tissue adhesives [ 2  3  4 ]  and recently with amniotic membrane and fibrin glue . 
 the indications for the use of a bandage soft contact lens to treat a corneal laceration include small wounds with good apposition  good alignment of the wound edges  and no incarceration or prolapse of the uvea or lens . 
 corneal puncture wounds of less than 2.0 mm in size can usually heal without being sutured . in this case  the wound was relatively small ( less than 1 mm )  but the apposition of the wound was not optimal due to a sharply demarcated punch  which made restoring the anterior chamber extremely difficult using a bandage soft contact lens only . in cases with good apposition  
 a small amount of viscoelastic materials through the perforation site is often enough to allow safe application of tissue adhesive without gluing intraocular contents . 
 the technique described in this case appears useful secondary to the minimal residual scarring and related astigmatism . 
 a second advantage of this technique is that the iris is introduced to the perforation site from inside the eye in a controlled manner to prevent excessive iris prolapse and provide a stable support for the tissue adhesive . 
 this is more adequate than the use of an amniotic membrane  which is very slippery and difficult to be fixed on the wound . 
 furthermore  this technique requires no foreign tissue  thereby eliminating the risk of immunological tissue reactions . 
 the tissue adhesive may also theoretically circumvent the potential risks of epithelial down - growth by preventing corneal epithelium from growing directly over the iris . 
 this technique is safe and effective for paracentrally located corneal perforation ; however  significant synechiae involving the angle could prove to be problematic when the perforation is more peripheral . 
 very small descemet 's membrane transplantation instead of iris incarceration may be the other option for this situation . in conclusion  
 application of cyanoacrylate adhesive following iatrogenic incarceration of the iris seems to be simple and effective in managing small paracentral corneal perforations without good apposition .

Abstract: Surgical intervention was successfully used to manage a small paracentral corneal perforation using autologous iris incarceration and tissue adhesive. The anterior chamber was immediately reformed and complete corneal epithelialization was achieved in 2 months. This technique is simple and potentially useful for small corneal perforations outside the visual axis.

Research and Discussion: The 41-year-old man developed a small paracentral corneal perforation while removing a piece of metallic foreign body. The eye was initially managed with a bandage soft contact lens, but ultimately required surgical intervention due to failure to ameliorate the aqueous leakage. Using iatrogenic iris incarceration and cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive, the anterior chamber was successfully reformed and maintained.

Results and Conclusion: In this case, the use of cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive and iatrogenic iris incarceration was effective in treating a small paracentral corneal perforation. Complete corneal epithelialization was achieved in 2 months without any visual compromises. This simple technique has potential use for similar perforations away from the visual axis and without good apposition. "
"it has long been recognized that psychiatric disorders and symptoms aggregate in families and the evidence for a substantial role for genetic factors is incontrovertible . 
 genetic epidemiological studies of autism  bipolar disorder and schizophrenia show that the risk of developing one of these specific psychiatric illnesses is proportional to the amount of genetic material shared with an affected individual . 
 heritability has been estimated as being at least 80% for all these disorders [ 2 - 4 ]  which  to put it in context  is equivalent to that for type 
 i diabetes ( about 80% )   but greater than that for breast cancer   or parkinson 's disease . 
 the majority of psychiatric disorders  like other common conditions  are genetically complex . in psychiatry  genetic complexity has been compounded by phenotypic complexity . 
 psychiatric diagnosis can not be made on the basis of biological investigation or validated against a common pathogenesis . 
 psychiatric ' disorders ' such as autism  schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are therefore effectively groups of symptoms making up syndromes that define groups of patients who show broadly similar outcomes and who respond similarly to treatment . 
 such diagnostic categories are therefore likely to be heterogeneous and the boundaries between them somewhat arbitrary . 
 autism  schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have traditionally been considered as separate disease entities  although they do share some common behavioral characteristics and cognitive deficits . 
 the distinction between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder has been justified for many years by reference to family studies showing that these disorders seem to ' breed true ' . however 
  this view has been challenged  and a recent large - scale study has shown that relatives of individuals affected with schizophrenia have increased risks of bipolar disorder  and vice versa . 
 definitive genetic epidemiological studies of the genetic relationship between autism and these disorders are lacking  although there is some evidence for shared genetic factors . in recent years new molecular genetic findings  particularly from the application of genome - wide association studies 
 ( gwass ) and other genomic technologies [ 11 - 14 ]  have implicated risk factors for these disorders  and this has allowed the possibility of a genetic relationship between them to be explored directly and current orthodoxies to be challenged [ 8 - 10 ] . 
 autism spectrum disorders ( asds ) such as autism  asperger 's syndrome and rett 's syndrome  are developmental psychiatric disorders with high heritability . over the past few years 
  genetic studies of asds have consistently identified rare and de novo point mutations and large structural variants present in genes encoding interacting synaptic proteins . 
 such studies have reported co - segregation of putative high - risk alleles ( such as deletions or point mutations ) with asds or performed so - called ' burden analysis '  in which different alleles of a particular gene are aggregated and the frequency in cases compared with that in controls . 
 initial studies of asds using small samples found rare missense point and structural mutations ( such as copy number variants  cnvs ) in the x - linked neuroligin-3 and neuroligin-4 ( nlgn4 ) genes [ 17 - 19 ] . 
 neuroligins are a family of post - synaptic proteins that bind trans - synaptically to a family of pre - synaptic proteins called neurexins . 
 although these findings were interesting  incomplete penetrance of the mutations and lack of power made the results equivocal . 
 however  missense mutations were subsequently identified in the neurexin-1 ( nrxn1 ) gene at a high frequency in individuals with autism . 
 these suggestive findings have been augmented by the results of recent genomic studies discussed below . 
 traditional karyotyping  gwass and comparative genome hybridization ( cgh ) analyses have been used to identify large chromosomal structural losses ( deletions ) and gains ( duplications ) in individuals with asds [ 21 - 24 ] . a burden analysis study of approximately 200 affected individuals identified two translocation events at nrxn1 in separate samples  one disrupting the coding sequence and the other lying 5 ' to the gene 
 . a further study of over 1000 pedigrees using approximately 10000 single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) identified a 300 kb deletion of coding exons of nrxn1 co - segregating with autism . 
 genome - wide analyses have also implicated further related and interacting synaptic protein - coding genes in the etiology of asds . 
 first  a study of 427 asd cases using approximately 500000 snps identified a 6 mb de novo deletion encompassing nlgn4   and a 270 kb deletion at shank3 . 
 second  burden analyses revealed a high frequency of point mutations of shank3 in asd cases . 
 third  cntnap2  which encodes a member of the neurexin family that resides in the juxtaparanodal region of myelinated neurons  shows evidence for common - allele association with asds   as well as an increased burden of rare protein - coding mutations   and large de novo deletions . 
 the evidence implicating synaptic cell adhesion molecules and their related proteins in asds is strong . 
 data implicating them in schizophrenia is now arguably even stronger . a whole - genome screen for large chromosomal abnormalities using array - cgh performed in 93 individuals with schizophrenia identified a hemizygous loss at nrxn1 in one case . 
 the deletion of exon 1 was also present in an affected sibling and no deletions of nrxn1 were observed in 372 controls  suggesting that the allele may be pathogenic . 
 the same study also found a large ( 1.4 mb ) de novo duplication event in an individual with an asd that spanned apba2 ; this is an intriguing result given that the gene encodes a protein ( mint2 ) that binds to intracellular domains of neurexins . 
 further to this  an independent cgh study identified rare deletions of nrxn1 in monozygotic twins both diagnosed with early - onset schizophrenia . 
 higher - density  lower - cost genome - wide screens using gwas technologies have made it feasible to screen many thousands of individuals for smaller copy number variations . using over 300000 probes across the genome assayed in approximately 3000 european cases and 10 times as many european controls  burden analysis revealed many deletions at the nrxn1 locus . 
 the authors   reported a significant excess of protein - coding deletions present in cases  a finding that is replicated in a similar analysis performed on an independent sample of approximately 3000 cases of european descent and 3000 controls   and also in two further studies using smaller sample sizes . 
 so far  no data implicating neuroligins and shanks in schizophrenia have been reported . however  hemizygosity of the cntnap2 gene  which encodes a member of the neurexin family  contactin - associated protein - like 2 ( caspr2 )  has been reported in schizophrenia   and also in individuals with mental retardation . 
 although the available data provide relatively strong evidence that disruption of the neurexin-1 locus ( nrxn1 ) is a risk factor for schizophrenia   and asds  evidence in relation to bipolar disorder is lacking . 
 this might reflect the relative paucity of studies addressing this hypothesis  but it could be the result of a discontinuity between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relation to the role of cnvs ( see below ) . 
 the recent application of genome - wide technologies has shown that the burden of large  rare cnvs is increased in schizophrenia when compared with controls  and that this implicates specific loci . 
 studies of such magnitude have not yet been performed for asds  although there is evidence for the involvement of specific cnvs . 
 in contrast  there is evidence that the global burden of duplications or deletions in bipolar disorder is substantially less than for schizophrenia and asds . 
 specific deletions associated with schizophrenia include those at 22q11.2  1q21.1 and 15q13.3  and these have also been found in association with mental retardation  autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ 364146 - 50 ] while that at 15q13.3 has also been implicated in idiopathic generalized epilepsy . 
 therefore  just as for nrxn1 deletions  it is apparent that these large cnvs confer risk of a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes  including autism  mental retardation and schizophrenia . 
 however  similar evidence is lacking for bipolar disorder and there is a suggestion that cnvs might have a less prominent role in this phenotype . 
 the advent of the gwas has allowed most of the common snp variation in the human genome to be tested for association   and the first wave of such studies has been reported for schizophrenia  bipolar disorder [ 54 - 56 ] and autism . 
 several loci have been implicated at genome - wide levels of statistical significance for schizophrenia  including znf804a ( encoding a protein with zinc finger and nucleic acid binding domains )   and the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) region . 
 these studies have also provided strong evidence for genetic overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . 
 however  these associations implicate common alleles with small effects  and findings from gwass do not yet clearly suggest a specific biological process . 
 so far there have been no systematic comparisons of gwas data for asds with those from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder . 
 however  intriguing associations have been reported at voltage - gated calcium channel genes across all these phenotypes [ 5658 - 60 ] . 
 furthermore  there have been recent reports of association for common alleles at several gaba receptor genes in a subtype of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia  which implicate loci also reported as associated with asds [ 2363 - 65 ] . 
 the evidence for involvement of neurexins ( nrxn1 )  neuroligins ( nlgn4 ) and related proteins such as shanks ( shank3 )  mint2 ( a2bp1 ) and caspr2 ( cntnap2 ) in asds is substantial and growing . 
 there is also strong evidence implicating some of these genes in schizophrenia  although not all of them have been examined . 
 given this overlap  it is possible that the genes may be exerting their effects through a biological pathway common to both disorders . 
 the neurexins are a family of transmembrane proteins that have extracellular  membranous and intracellular domains . 
 neurexins can be divided into two groups   and  neurexins ; both are encoded by three genes . 
 the neurexins are primarily expressed in neurons  where they are known as pre - synaptic heterophilic adhesion molecules  and they typically bind across the synapse to neuroligins . 
 the neuroligins represent a similar class of proteins to neurexins and the binding of the two types of molecule to each other is controlled by alternative splicing . 
 the intracellular domains of neurexins ( and neuroligins ) bind scaffolding proteins and assemble large molecular complexes that are known to link to synaptic systems such as receptors  ion channels and vesicle release machinery . 
 neurexins are best known for their ability to promote cell adhesion and synaptogenesis when neuroligins are present on the neighboring cell . even in non - neuronal cell lines  
 it seems that neurexins and neuroligins are necessary for both excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis  and possibly in functional synapse maturation . 
 it has been hypothesized that neurexins and neuroligins are involved in the promiscuous generation of many synapses  before their activity - dependent pruning . 
 however  multiple neurexin gene knockout studies in mice seem to contradict this and suggest that the neurexin - neuroligin complex is not essential for synapse formation but for synapse function . deletions of -neurexin result in increased lethality  normal synapse number and gross anatomy but severely impaired synaptic functioning  a pattern strikingly similar to neuroligin gene knockouts . 
 such biological roles fit with hypotheses of the etiology of autism and schizophrenia in which a neurodevelopmental insult and adult imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission occur in the absence of overt macro - pathology . 
 shank3 is implicated in autism by several lines of evidence [ 23252668 - 70 ] and functions as a post - synaptic scaffolding protein that binds indirectly to neuroligins  forming a potentially functional circuit of neurexin - neuroligin - shank that is dysregulated in asds . 
 the involvement of -neurexins in pre - synaptic neurotransmission suggests a functional link with voltage - gated calcium channels  which are integral to pre - synaptic function and plasticity and have been implicated to be involved in autism  schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [ 5658 - 6073 ] . 
 therefore  the evidence from asds  schizophrenia and bipolar disorder suggests a convergence on specific processes involved in the development and regulation of synaptic transmission . 
 further work on the biology of neurexins  neuroligins and related proteins is certainly required and it seems likely that the pathogenic roles of these proteins will be illuminated by further human genetic studies . 
 whole - genome studies of many thousands of affected individuals are uncovering evidence for genetic overlap between autism  schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . 
 studies of cnvs and other rare alleles have found overlap between autism and schizophrenia  whereas those of common snp variants have shown overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . 
 these findings suggest that schizophrenia  autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders may share underlying pathogenic mechanisms and challenges the view that these are completely unrelated diagnostic entities . 
 the findings also support the view that schizophrenia has a stronger neurodevelopmental component than bipolar disorder and suggest that it lies on a gradient of decreasing neurodevelopmental impairment between syndromes such as mental retardation and autism  on one hand  and bipolar disorder on the other . 
 the identification of rare and common alleles predisposing to prototypically distinct psychiatric disorders provides challenges for the ways in which such disorders are diagnosed and researched . 
 we have argued on the basis of recent genetic data that these findings point to common pathophysiological mechanisms  and this is now an important area for future research . 
 we have based this conclusion on the fact that several rare cnvs  including deletions of nrxn1  are associated with mental retardation  autism and schizophrenia  and on the overlap in common risk alleles seen between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [ 11 - 13 ] . 
 we do not propose that the disorders are the same phenomenologically  and we accept that there may be many genetic and environmental risk factors not shared between the phenotypes . 
 it is clear that much future work is required and equally clear that this should not be constrained by current categorical diagnostic systems . 
 such studies should explore the relationship of genes and other biological variables to dimensional measures of key domains of psychopathology across current diagnostic categories . 
 we have previously argued the need to undertake such endeavors across the functional psychoses of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . 
 however  recent data point to the need to consider a broader clinical spectrum that includes also autism and mental retardation / cognitive impairment . 
 asd : autism spectrum disorder ; cnv : copy number variant ; cgh : comparative genome hybridization ; gwas : genome - wide association study ; nlgn4 : neuroligin-4 ; nrxn1 : neurexin-1 ; snp : single - nucleotide polymorphism .

"fever is a common reason for seeking medical attention and accounts for more than 20% of emergency department visits.1 many mothers and caregivers have perceived phobia associated with their child 's fever for reasons that include serious infection  seizure  brain damage and death.2 paediatricians have regularly advised parents to seek immediate medical attention if their children developed a fever because fever is of great diagnostic importance especially in developing countries where infectious diseases such as malaria and pneumonia are very prevalent.3 in developing countries  because of the relatively low level of literacy and financial constraint of procuring reliable thermometers  many parents rely on palpation to assess if their children have fever.4 the objective use of the thermometer to detect the presence of fever is often limited to health care settings in most resource - poor settings . 
 an accurate determination of the absence of fever in a child assures parents and saves cost by preventing unnecessary investigations and medication . 
 ownership of thermometer seems poor  although no study in our environment was found to support that . in a study in new york  usa  of the 78% of caregivers that owned thermometers  nearly half ( 48% ) still utilised tactile method to assess fever.4 in another study  in india in contrast  only 15% owned thermometer with 23.8% of them not knowing how to use it.5 this underscores the fact that the use of palpation as a means of assessing fever by mothers is common and universal . 
 majority of mothers and care givers in our environment still utilise tactile assessment to determine if their children have fever . 
 controversies over the reliability of tactile assessment of fever have been variously reported ; while a study found it accurate enough  at least in younger infants4 others reported that it overestimates the presence of fever.67 the reliability of the use of palpation to detect fever still remains uncertain . 
 this study was carried out to determine the reliability of tactile assessment of fever by nigerian mothers in under-5 children and also to determine if the surface of the hand used influence the accuracy . 
 the study further ascertained if palpation of a single or multiple anatomical sites influence the accuracy of tactile assessment of fever . 
 children under the age of 5 years presenting for care with their mothers were recruited for the study . 
 ethical approval was obtained from the research and ethics committee of federal medical centre owerri  imo state nigeria before commencement of the study . 
 the subjects were recruited from the children outpatient clinic and children emergency room of the hospital . 
 information such as age and sex of the child  mother 's age and highest educational qualification ( heq ) were captured using a profoma . thereafter  each eligible child had a tactile assessment of fever by the mother . 
 the response of the mother as regard presence or absence of fever was documented following which the child 's axillary temperature was measured and documented . the axillary temperature was measured using mercury in glass thermometer  which was left in the axilla for 5 minutes before reading . 
 frequencies  percentages and mean were analysed where appropriate . the sensitivity  specificity  positive predictive values ( ppvs ) and negative predictive values ( npvs ) of tactile assessment was calculated using axillary temperature of 37.5c as cut - off for fever . 
 the different hand surfaces used for palpation  as well single versus multiple sites of palpation were also compared . 
 there were 60 males and 53 females giving a male : female ratio of 1.1:1 . 
 seven ( 6.2% ) of the mothers had only primary school education  while 38 ( 33.6% ) and 68 ( 60.2% ) had secondary and tertiary education  respectively . 
 fever detected by touch was reported in 81 ( 71.6% ) children by mothers while  only 65 ( 57.5% ) mothers were able to correctly predict the presence of fever in their children . 
 there was no statistical significant difference in the ability of the mothers to correctly predict fever with respect to their heq (  = 2.66  p = 0.265 ) . 
 comparison of fever detection by palpation with the mothers highest educational qualification ( heq ) irrespective of the part of hand used for palpation  the sensitivity of detection of fever by palpation was 82.4%  while the specificity was 37.1% . 
 the use of the palmer surface of the hand had a better sensitivity ( 95.2% ) than the dorsum of the hand ( 69.2% ) . 
 table 2 shows the sensitivity  specificity  ppv and npv of the part of hand used for palpation . 
 sensitivity  specificity  positive predictive value ( ppv ) and negative predictive value ( npv ) of the part of hand used for palpation a total of 71 ( 62.8% ) of the mothers palpated at more than one site while the remaining 42 ( 37.2% ) used only single site . 
 table 3 shows the different sites used by the mothers in palpation  while table 4 compares the sensitivity  specificity  ppv and npv of use of single site versus multiple sites in palpation . 
 the use of multiple sites had better sensitivity ( 86.7% ) than the use of single site ( 76.2% ) . 
 sites used by the mothers to palpate for fever palpation of single site versus multiple sites 
 the present study shows that mothers can be trusted to a good extent to assess for the presence of fever in children by palpation . 
 a sensitivity of 82.4% obtained in this study is similar to those reported by okposio and abhulimhen - iyoha in benin  nigeria as well as graneto and soglin in chicago  usa  who documented sensitivity of 89.2% and 84%  respectively.89 some studies in nigeria have reported a higher sensitivity value of 96.3% and 94.6%  respectively.610 a specificity of 37.1% obtained in the present study is quite poor and is lower than the specificities reported by other workers ranging from 64.3% to 82%.489 it is  however  higher than 23% reported by akinbami et al.6 the heterogeneity in the methodology of these studies may have been responsible for the differences obtained between the present study and some of the earlier studies . 
 for instance  akinbami et al.6 used rectal temperature of 38c as the cut - off of fever  wammanda and onazi10 adopted axillary temperature of 37.2c as the cut - off for fever  while the present study and that of okposio and abhulimhen - iyoha8 used axillary temperature of 37.5c as the definition of fever . 
 although the specificity in the present study was poor  the relatively high sensitivities obtained in all the studies still make maternal palpation for the presence of fever a considerably useful method of assessment of childhood fever . 
 although  palpation overestimates fever  the elicitation of fever by mothers would encourage early presentation as it has been documented that the concern for fever is a strong motivational factor for seeking medical care.2 the educational qualification of a mother did not influence the accuracy of palpation for the presence of fever . 
 it is therefore expected that any mother  irrespective of her educational background should be able to appreciate fever by palpation . with a npv of 71.9%  
 if a mother says her child does not have fever  her history of subjective assessment of fever without the use of a thermometer is about 72% reliable . 
 the likelihood of a child adjudged to be febrile by a mother to be truly febrile measured by the ppv in the present study is 51.9% . 
 this is higher than 39% reported by wheybrew and co - workers.7 this higher ppv reported in this study may have been influenced by the prevalence of fever in the present study . in the present study  
 57.5% of the study subjects had fever  while in the study of wheybrew et al.7 27% of children had fever . 
 the palmer surface of the hand was the most commonly used hand surface by mothers to palpate for fever . 
 the sensitivity  specificity  npv and ppv of palmer surface was higher than that of the dorsal surface or the use of both surfaces . 
 this may be attributed to the fact that receptors for detection of heat and temperature are more concentrated on the palmer surface and finger tips.11 the use of both surfaces may confuse the mother as the sensation obtained from both are likely to vary  hence the reduced sensitivity obtained in this study when compared with palmer surface alone . 
 the forehead was the most common site used for tactile assessment of fever in this study . 
 this corroborates reports from previous studies  which also found the forehead to be the most common anatomical site used for tactile assessment of fever.4 this may possibly be explained by the fact that the head is easily accessible compared with the other parts of the body . 
 it was observed that palpation of multiple sites was more sensitive than use of single site . 
 this is in agreement with an earlier report by okposio and abhulimhen - iyoha as well as singhi and sood.812 this implies that if fever is to be assessed by palpation without the use of a thermometer  palpation of multiple body sites should be utilised . 
 palpation with the palmer surface of the hand using multiple sites improves the reliability of tactile assessment of fever . 
 clinicians should not discountenance mothers complaint of fever in their children detected by palpation without the use of a thermometer . 
 mothers should be taught to palpate at multiple sites with the palmer surface when palpating for the presence of fever in their children to improve the accuracy .","

1) Abstract
This study aimed to determine the accuracy of subjective assessment of fever by Nigerian mothers in children under the age of 5. The results showed that palpation overestimates fever by 24.6%. Using the palmer surface of the hand and multiple sites improved sensitivity and reliability.

2) Research and Discussion
A total of 113 mother-child pairs participated in the study, with palpation being the primary method used by mothers to detect fever in their children. The results showed that palpation has a sensitivity of 82.4% and a specificity of 37.1%, indicating that it is not always accurate. However, using the palmer surface of the hand and multiple sites showed better results.

3) Results and Conclusion
The study concluded that tactile assessment of childhood fevers by mothers is still a relevant screening tool, with the use of the palmer surface of the hand and multiple sites improving its accuracy. This method can help mothers decide when to seek medical attention or administer self-medications for their children. The importance of educating mothers on using the correct technique for palpation should also be emphasized."
"pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( pdac ) represents the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide  with an incidence of approximately 217000 new cases each year nearly matched by 213000 deaths ( parkin et  al .  2001 ) . 
 several of the most frequent genetic events underlying the initiation and progression of human pancreatic cancer have been identified ( hezel et  al .  2006 ; maitra and hruban  2008 ) . 
 these include activating mutations in the kras proto - oncogene  which occur in > 90% of pdac ( caldas and kern  1995 ) and are considered as a key driver for pancreatic carcinogenesis  and mutations inactivating the tp53 gene  which occur in 5075% of patients ( redston et  al .  1994 ) . 
 moreover  several lines of evidence implicate mutations inactivating the brca2 tumour suppressor in an estimated 520% of familial pdac ( hahn et  al .  2003 ; couch et  al .  2007 ) . 
 germline carriers of deleterious brca2 mutations that commonly truncate the encoded protein exhibit an increased lifetime risk of developing pdac  in addition to their well - known predisposition to cancers of the breast and ovary ( breast cancer linkage consortium  1999 ) . within high - risk pancreatic cancer kindreds  inherited mutations in brca2 represent the most frequently encountered germline genetic alteration ( hahn et  al .  2003 ) . 
 the incidence of germline brca2 mutations in apparently sporadic pancreatic cancers may be as high as in breast or ovarian cancer ( goggins et  al .  1996 ) . 
 more recently  palb2  which encodes a brca2-interacting protein also essential for homology - directed dna repair  has emerged as a pancreatic cancer susceptibility allele ( jones et  al .  2009 ) . 
 three new transgenic models for pancreatic adenocarcinoma associated with brca2 inactivation have recently been described ( skoulidis et  al . 
 one of these models does not incorporate activation of the kras oncogene ( feldmann et  al .  2011 ) . 
 in contrast  the other two models ( skoulidis et  al .  2010 ; rowley et  al .  2011 ) use a conditional gene - targeted allele developed by tuveson  jacks and colleagues ( jackson et  al .  2001 ; 
 johnson et  al .  2001 )  in which tissue - specific activation of oncogenic krasg12d is driven on a single allele by loxp - cre mediated recombination  mimicking a genetic event that frequently triggers kras activation in human cancers . 
 cre recombinase expression is controlled by the pdx1 promoter  which is expressed at e8.5 and required for organogenesis of the pancreas  whereby loss of the gene is associated with an absence of pancreatic formation ( jonsson et  al .  1994 ; offield et  al .  
 the expression of the pdx1-cre transgene therefore occurs throughout the pancreatic cellular compartment  albeit in a stochastic manner  to trigger kras activation ( hingorani et  al .  
 patients who carry germline mutations affecting brca2 harbour the germline mutant allele in all somatic tissues  whereas the second brca2 allele is wildtype ( wooster et  al .  1994 ) . 
 it has been widely believed that loss of the second  wild - type brca2 allele in nascent cancer cells ( termed  loss of heterozygosity or loh ) is necessary for the emergence of tumours in germline mutation carriers . the pancreatic cancer model developed in our laboratory ( skoulidis et  al .  2010 ) 
 it carries in all somatic tissues a truncated allele of murine brca2 ( brca2 )  which truncates the gene in an evolutionarily conserved and functionally critical region encoded by exon 11  resembling deleterious germline mutations found in human carriers ( friedman et  al .  1998 ) . 
 the second brca2 allele  brca2 ( jonkers et  al .  2001 ) can be conditionally disrupted to remove exon 11 by loxp - cre recombination in the pancreas . 
 this event is driven by pdx1-cre  and therefore occurs in the same tissues which undergo kras activation . 
 there is evidence that both the brca2 and brca2 alleles can express a truncated protein product ( patel et  al .  1998 ; 
 notably  the models developed by rowley et  al . and feldmann et  al . 
 both exclusively use a strain homozygous for the conditional brca2 allele ; thus  germline heterozygosity for brca2 is not modelled in their experiments . 
 all three of the new pancreatic cancer models incorporate conditional alleles that inactivate tp53 in the pancreas  to mimic the frequent loss of this tumour suppressor in human pancreatic cancers . 
 somewhat different tp53 alleles are used by each group  an important distinction given that the nature of tp53 mutations is thought to affect pancreatic cancer development ( olive et  al .  2004 ) . 
 two of the studies employ gain - of - function mutants affecting a single allele . 
 these are either the structural mutant tp53 ( feldmann et  al .  2011 ) or the contact mutant tp53 ( skoulidis et  al .  2010 ) . 
 both these tp53 mutants are associated with the development of carcinomas ( olive et  al .  2004 ) . 
 in contrast  the third study uses a null allele of tp53  wherein exons 210 are deleted by pdx1-cre activation ( rowley et  al .  2011 )  in a manner that less faithfully represents human cancer - associated mutations . 
 thus  it should be clear from the foregoing that these three recently - published models for pancreatic carcinogenesis associated with brca2 inactivation harbour important differences not only in the tissue - specificity  nature and timing of mutant tp53 and brca2 alleles  but also in the presence of mutant kras . 
 we believe that these distinctions are vital to understanding the marked differences in pancreatic carcinogenesis observed in the studies  the key findings from which are highlighted in table 1 . 
 brca2 has been believed to follow the classical  two - hit paradigm for tumour suppression ( smith et  al .  1992 ; collins et  al . 
 initial studies soon after the discovery of brca2 reported consistent inactivation of the wild - type brca2 allele through loss - of - heterozygosity ( loh ) in breast or ovarian cancer cells from mutation carriers ( collins et  al .  1995 ; gudmundsson et  al .  
 1995 )  engendering the widely accepted view that brca2 loh is an essential event in carcinogenesis . 
 a few notes of dissent have emerged in later studies ( king et  al . 
  2007 ; willems et  al .  2008 )  but they have not gained widespread attention . in this context 
 unexpectedly reveal that brca2 heterozygosity promotes pancreatic cancer development in mice and men . in both the tp53 wildtype and tp53 cohorts from the murine model  
 heterozygosity for brca2 ( through the brca2 genotype ) acts with kras to accelerate the progression and development of pdac . 
 a similar conclusion is reached from studies on a small number of human pancreatic cancer samples from carriers of the icelandic founder mutation in brca2  the allele brca2  which is 5 bp deletion in exon 9 that causes a frame - shift leading to the expression of a very short and unstable protein product ( mikaelsdottir et  al .  2004 ) . 
 one possibility is that this genotype causes a mutator phenotype  owing to defects in dna repair arising from a known role of brca2 in homologous dna recombination ( patel et  al .  1998 ; 
 however  previous studies on murine embryo fibroblasts ( mefs ) heterozygous for brca2 reveal no statistically significant effects on sensitivity to genotoxic agents ( patel et  al . 
 neither brca2 mice ( friedman et  al .  1998 )  nor strains heterozygous for other brca2 truncation mutants ( connor et  al . 
  2001 ; yan et  al .  2004 )  exhibit cancer predisposition . 
 notably  a lacz mutation reporter gene ( boerrigter et  al .  1995 ) incorporated into the germline of mice heterozygous for a brca2 truncation similar but not identical to brca2 ( tutt et  al .  
 2002 ) reveals no evident mutator phenotype . on the other hand  mefs from this strain showed a mild alteration in dna repair kinetics during recovery from 4gy of ionizing radiation . 
 thus  there is little convincing evidence that heterozygosity for these brca2 mutant alleles creates a dna repair defect that could explain heightened cancer predisposition  although the possibility has not yet been conclusively excluded . in this connection  it is important to note that these cellular approaches do not yet account for the cooperative effect of mutant kras on pancreatic carcinogenesis associated with brca2 heterozygosity  as suggested by the murine model developed by skoulidis et  al . 
 even a subtle increase in mutational load induced by brca2 heterozygosity in mutant kras expressing cells  which might be undetectable in cellular experiments  but significant in  vivo  could plausibly accelerate the progression of pre - malignant pancreatic intra - epithelial ( panin ) lesions ( which occur frequently even in apparently normal pancreatic parenchyma ( hruban et  al .  2008 ) ) to overt malignancy . 
 whether different brca2 alleles behave in a manner similar to brca2 is not clear . like brca2  
 however  the instability of the truncated protein encoded by brca2 ( mikaelsdottir et  al .  2004 ) suggests that haploinsufficiency for brca2 ( as opposed to any trans - dominant effect of a mutant brca2 protein ) accounts for the phenotypic effects of heterozygosity in patients who carry this icelandic founder mutation . 
 describe no heterozygous effect in any of their brca2 cohorts despite the presence of mutant kras . 
 interpretation of this difference is not straightforward  since the brca2 allele engenders brca2 loss only in the cells expressing pdx1-cre  unlike brca2  which is expressed in all somatic cells . 
 this raises the possibility that non - cell autonomous effects of brca2 heterozygosity  for example on stromal cells rather than the nascent cancer cells  may account for the cancer - predisposing effect of the brca2 allele . 
 mitotic functions have also been ascribed to brca2  and interestingly  defects in g2 checkpoint function ( menzel et  al .  2011 )  mitotic checkpoint enforcement ( choi et  al .  2012 ) and the completion of cell division by cytokinesis ( daniels et  al .  2004 ; 
 whether or not these roles for brca2 may explain the effect of heterozygosity in tumour development is yet to be explored . 
 heterozygosity for the brca2 allele is enough to trigger cytokinetic defects in mefs ( daniels et  al .  2004 )  but it is unclear whether the other mitotic functions are perturbed by brca2 heterozygosity . 
 importantly  recent data from human studies further support that brca2 heterozygosity is enough to promote carcinogenesis . in breast cancers  
 incomplete loss of the remaining wild - type allele has been observed using techniques more sensitive than those applied in the original studies ( king et  al .  2007 ) . 
 importantly large - scale  unbiased genomic sequencing of high - grade serous ovarian carcinomas highlighted the retention of the wild - type allele in end stage disease from 25% of germline brca2 carriers ( atlas  2011 ) . 
 furthermore  a detailed study of prostate tumour progression in brca2 germline mutation carriers uncovered no loh in high - grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias  considered precursor lesions to the development of prostate adenocarcinoma  and up to 55% of the malignant tumours analysed ( willems - jones et  al .  2012 ) . 
 collectively  these data suggest that cancers arising in germline brca2 mutation carriers frequently fail to exhibit loss of the wildtype allele  and that failure to exhibit loh occurs in brca2-mutant cancers from several different tissues . 
 interestingly  these conclusions can be set against the emerging backdrop of ongoing studies on tissue samples from patients with familial forms of pancreatic cancer 
 . a study of 58 pancreatic intra - epithelial neoplasms and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms reveals that somatic losses in brca2 copy number are infrequent ( hong et  al .  2012 ) . 
 however  definitive evidence addressing the extent to which the lessons from gemms of brca2-deficient pancreatic cancers can be applied to human neoplasia awaits the results of more extensive genome sequencing studies on pancreatic cancer samples from patients harbouring germline brca2 mutations . 
 murine pancreatic cancers emerging in brca2 strains in which both brca2 alleles are inactivated in pdx1-cre expressing cells exhibit a preponderance of acinar cell carcinoma histology . correspondingly  3 of the four human pancreatic cancers from brca2 mutation carriers that exhibited loh were also of the acinar type ( skoulidis et  al .  2010 )  which normally accounts for only 12%% of human pancreatic cancers ( hruban  2007 ) . 
 this raises the possibility that these genotypes promote the evolution of acinar cell carcinomas rather than pdac . 
 ( 2011 ) also observe differences in the histopathological spectrum of pancreatic malignancies from mice in which brca2 as well as tp53 had been inactivated  when compared to tp53 deficiency alone . 
 these observations raise the possibility that the nature of brca2 mutations  their timing  or their coincidence with alterations with tp53 may alter the histopathological evolution of pancreatic cancers in mice . however  these observations remain too limited to allow firm conclusions to be drawn  and we draw attention to them here simply to emphasize the need for further studies . 
 we and others have shown ( patel et  al .  1998 ; lee et  al .  1999 ; tutt et  al .  1999 ) that the genome - wide dna damage that follows homozygous inactivation of brca2 leads to checkpoint activation and cell cycle arrest  rather than the unrestrained cellular proliferation typical of cancer . 
 we have previously proposed ( venkitaraman  2009 ) that checkpoint inactivation may therefore be an essential pre - requisite for homozygous brca2 inactivation through loh during carcinogenesis . 
 the work of skoulidis et  al . provides strong in  vivo evidence for this hypothesis  supported by the observations of rowley et  al . in both murine models  
 bi - allelic brca2 inactivation by itself leads to a loss of exocrine pancreatic parenchyma  a concomitant increase in adipose tissue  and progressive loss of organ functionality . 
 further demonstrate that pancreatic insufficiency is preceded by the widespread occurrence of dna double - strand breakage marked by h2ax staining in cells lacking both copies of brca2 . 
 moreover  both skoulidis et  al . and rowley et  al . find that the concomitant inactivation of tp53 function prevents pancreatic insufficiency  and allows rapid pdac development  in the pancreas of mice carrying bi - allelic mutations inactivating brca2 . 
 when the observations from these studies are synthesized  a picture emerges wherein brca2 heterozygosity in germline mutation carriers may suffice to allow the development of kras - driven pdac . 
 later inactivation of tp53 or other checkpoint genes may then allow eventual loss of the second brca2 allele : although loh is not an obligate step  it may promote the emergence of advanced cancers . 
 indeed  inferences from a very small study of just 5 samples from human pancreatic cancer patients support such a scenario  although it remains to be firmly established . 
  our results suggest that brca2 heterozygosity suffices for pdac formation driven by mutant kras in mice and men . 
 however  the rationale for the use of targeted agents such as parp1 inhibitors ( parp1i ) in brca2-deficient cancers is contingent upon bi - allelic brca2 inactivation in the tumour cells ( bryant et  al .  
 therefore  as confirmed in our work ( skoulidis et  al .  2010 )  pdac cells that retain a functional brca2 allele are resistant to parpi such as the astrazeneca compound olaparib . 
 thus  parp1 inhibitors should be reserved for clinical use when brca2 loh can be verified in the tumour  assessment of which emerges as a critical requirement in the design of human clinical trials for the treatment of brca2-deficient cancers . 
 these findings exemplify how the new generation of gemms for pdac may represent valuable surrogate models for preclinical tests of therapeutic efficacy in patients . 
 importantly  such models not only allow in  vivo proof of new therapeutic concepts  but may also provide a platform to assess the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of new agents  although species - specific differences may limit such interpretations . 
 the models also provide a flexible method to assess the impact of therapy on tumour progression using adapted multimodal imaging and drug bioavailability ( including tissue drug penetrance ) analyses . 
 an important feature that determines if a particular gemm is useful as a preclinical platform is if the model recapitulates a similar clinical response to standard therapy agents in clinical use in human . 
 for instance  the kpc mouse model is relatively unaffected by gemcitabine similar to the small clinical benefit from this agent in the advanced pancreatic cancer setting in humans ( olive et  al .  2009 ) . 
 each gemm can be likened to a patient with a particular tumour type  and hence  can be enrolled into preclinical trial of novel agents ( eklund et  al .  2013 ; guerra and barbacid  2013 ) . 
 such trials are facilitated by the use of adapted imaging techniques to monitor for tumour development and progression . 
 such utility is beginning to have an impact in the clinical setting . in humans  
 early phase clinical trials have shown promise for the combination of nanoparticle albumin - linked paclitaxel ( nab - paclitaxel ) and gemcitabine in advanced pdac . 
 frese and colleagues have used the kpc mouse model of pancreatic cancer to provide a mechanistic understanding of the synergistic effect of this combination . 
 paclitaxel appears to inhibit the breakdown of gemcitabine through modulation of a degradative enzyme  cytidine deaminase through a reactive oxygen species - dependent pathway ( frese et  al .  2012 ) . 
 such mechanistic analyses may help to rationalize our clinical strategy of using such drug combination . 
 for instance  the nab - paclitaxel can be used as an inducting agent followed by gemcitabine to enhance the tumouricidal effect of the latter . 
 rational clinical trials in man are likely to benefit from the incorporation of an in  vivo component that provides relatively rapid feedback of the predicted response to new agents . the preclinical assessment using gemms can either be used to screen potentially useful therapeutic agents before progressing to clinical trials  or alternatively  to critically assess the mechanisms of action in  vivo once an agent has been found to be effective in a small - scale trial  before progressing to larger phase iii clinical trial . 
 one potential advantage of such gemms is that unlike human trials  they will allow sequential sampling of appropriate tumour tissues to assess the pharmacodynamic impact of a particular agent . in pancreatic cancer 
  several novel agents targeting a diverse range of molecular pathways have been tested in gemms to complement early phase clinical trials ( olive et  al . 
  2009 ; plentz et  al .  2009 ; cook et  al . 
 the results of these trials will in due course affirm or refute the value of pdac gemms as a predictive tool for clinical efficacy in human cancers . 
 the potential value of pdac gemms as surrogates for the preclinical testing of new therapies is critically dependent on how closely these models mimic human pdac . 
 several studies ( hingorani et  al .  2003 ; tuveson and hingorani  2005 ; olive et  al .  2009 ; plentz et  al .  2009 ; cook et  al . 
  2012 ) have emphasized the similarities in histopathology  cancer progression  clinical behaviour and even drug pharmacodynamics between pdac gemms and human pdacs . 
 initial observations suggest that murine kpc pdacs bear resemblance to the human disease insofar as they exhibit a high degree of genomic instability  evident from multiple non - reciprocal chromosomal translocations ( hingorani et  al .  2005 ) . however  with emerging data from large - scale sequencing of human pdac tumours ( biankin et  al .  2012 )  it is now imperative that we further validate the gemms at the genomic level to compare the genomic landscapes of murine and human tumours . because pdac gemms incorporate high - penetrance genetic events such as initiating oncogenes or inactivated tumour suppressor genes from an early stage in a large number of susceptible cells  the resulting stereotypy of the malignancies arising therein may not reflect the heterogeneity likely to be present in human cancers . 
 importantly  the genetic heterogeneity of human cancers may give rise to differing therapeutic responses to any particular agent due to the differing genetic and epigenetic signatures of the constituent cells . 
 it is conceivable that individual tumours can take differing genetic  routes to achieve tumoural progression  depending on the type of initiating genetic lesions and secondary genetic hits that occur stochastically . 
 it is presumed that through inactivation of genes involved in maintaining genomic stability ( e.g. brca2 in models of pancreatic cancer ) may promote the stochastic acquisition of genetic and consequent morphologic heterogeneity due to the expected increase in mutation rate . 
 however  this point remains to be established in future studies  and also has important implications for the potential value of gemm models in testing new therapeutic approaches against pdac .",".


1) Abstract: This study focuses on the role of chromosomal instability in the development of human cancer cells, particularly through inactivation of the tumour suppressor gene BRCA2. Studies on BRCA2-deficient mouse models reveal novel insights into cancer evolution and provide preclinical settings for testing pancreatic cancer therapy.

2) Research and Discussion: Through the loss of essential functions of the BRCA2 protein in DNA replication, repair and segregation during cell division, chromosomal instability is a driving force in carcinogenesis. Mouse models genetically engineered with BRCA2 mutations provide valuable insights into the interaction between TP53 inactivation and cancer development, as well as potential therapeutic approaches for pancreatic cancer.

3) Results and Conclusion: Recent studies utilizing BRCA2-deficient mouse models have challenged the traditional Knudson two-hit paradigm for tumour suppression and shed light on the tumour suppressive role of BRCA2. These findings have important implications for individuals with germline BRCA2 mutations, who are highly predisposed to multiple types of cancer. The use of genetically engineered mouse models in cancer research continues to provide valuable insights and opportunities for understanding and treating human cancers."
"central venous catheters ( cvc ) are often used in the intensive care unit ( icu ) for monitoring and treatment of critically ill patients to provide long - term venous access . however 
  their use may result in nosocomial catheter - related bloodstream infection ( crbsi ) . 
 the estimated number of crbsi is approximately 250000 annually in the united states [ 24 ]  with an incidence of approximately 1.65 infections per 1000 central line days  and it was reported to be of 6.8 infections per 1000 central line days in asia . 
 indeed  crbsi is associated with a 2.27-fold increased risk of mortality in the icu . 
 host factors such as chronic illness  bone marrow transplantation  immune deficiency  malnutrition  total parenteral nutrition  previous history of crbsi  old age  and skin trauma increase the risk of crbsi . in addition 
  catheter factors also play a role in crbsi onset  such as duration of catheterization  type of catheter  conditions of insertion  insertion site care  and skill of the person who inserted the catheter [ 1013 ] . in cases of crbsi 
  empiric antibiotic therapy must be started as soon as possible  and must be based on the clinical characteristics of the patients . 
 catheter removal is necessary in cases of severe sepsis  hemodynamic instability  endocarditis  erythema  or bacteremia persisting after 72 hours of antibiotic therapy . 
 once the responsible organism is identified  tailored antibiotic therapy may be started  and usually lead to better outcomes . 
 however  little is known about the risk factors for early crbsi onset  and few data are available about the clinical manifestations and mortality of crbsi in china . 
 therefore  the aim of the present study was to assess the risk factors and catheter characteristics of 73 cases of nosocomial crbsi in the icu between january 2010 and december 2012 . 
 we analyzed the clinical features and treatment outcomes  and provide evidence for early diagnosis and treatment of crbsi  as well as risk factors for early crbsi onset . 
 this study was performed at the taizhou hospital of integrated traditional chinese and western medicine in zhejiang ( zhejiang wenlin  china ) in patients hospitalized in the icu between january 2010 and december 2012 . 
 the ethics committee of the hospital approved the study  and waived the requirement for individual consent . 
 patients were included if : 1 ) they developed bacteremia or fungemia while having a cvc or within 48 h of cvc removal ; 2 ) fever ( > 38c )  shivering or hypotension ; and 3 ) no other apparent source of infection . 
 in addition  at least one of the following criteria had to be met : 1 ) the same pathogenic agent was isolated from the catheter tip and from the peripheral venous blood ( at least once )  detected with a semi - quantitative method ( each catheter fragment contained > 15 bacteria / cfu ) or quantitative method ( each catheter fragment contained > 10 bacteria / cfu ) ; 2 ) intra - catheter and peripheral blood culture was positive  and the bacterial colony count in the intra - catheter blood was at least 3 times greater compared with the peripheral blood ; or 3 ) the time to report the positive intra - catheter blood culture was at least 2 h earlier than that of the positive peripheral blood culture . 
 patients were excluded if : 1 ) there was no clinical manifestation of bloodstream infection ; or 2 ) other causes of bloodstream infection could not be excluded . 
 the clinical data of patients with nosocomial crbsi were collected and analyzed in accordance with the 2009 clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of intravascular catheter - related infection from the infectious diseases society of america ( idsa ) . 
 patients age  sex  reason of icu admission  underlying diseases  time and position of indwelling cvc  type of cvc  pathogenic identification  treatment  prognosis  and mortality attributable to crbsi were reviewed . 
 timely removal of the catheter was defined as cvc removal within 12 h of fever onset . 
 appropriate antibiotic use was defined as the empirical use of antibiotics  which were confirmed to have covered the pathogenic bacteria in the drug sensitive test later . 
 patients with timely cvc removal and appropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group a. patients with timely cvc removal and inappropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group b. patients with untimely cvc removal and appropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group c. finally  patients with untimely cvc removal and inappropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group d. all continuous data are expressed as means  standard deviation ( sd ) . 
 inter - group comparison of the measured data was performed using analysis of variance ( anova )  and t - tests were used for post hoc analysis . 
 categorical data are presented as proportions  and were compared using chi - square tests  using a segmentation approach to compare group pairs . 
 the risk factors of early crbsi were evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses .

 patients with timely cvc removal and appropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group a. patients with timely cvc removal and inappropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group b. patients with untimely cvc removal and appropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group c. finally  patients with untimely cvc removal and inappropriate antibiotic use were assigned to group d. 
 inter - group comparison of the measured data was performed using analysis of variance ( anova )  and t - tests were used for post hoc analysis . 
 categorical data are presented as proportions  and were compared using chi - square tests  using a segmentation approach to compare group pairs .

 redness and swelling at the site of indwelling catheter was found in 14 cases ( 19.1% )  including 7 cases ( 9.7% ) with local purulent secretions . 
 the major treatment for patients with crbsi was cvc removal and the use of effective antibiotics . 
 we observed 47 cases with cvc being removed within 12 h after blood sampling  and all of them showed a rapid drop in body temperature following cvc removal . 
 seventeen cases had their cvc removed after a report of positive blood culture  while cvc was not removed in 9 cases . 
 empirical antibiotic therapy was administered to all subjects before confirmation of a positive blood culture  and was continued after positive blood culture was confirmed  or replaced by another antibiotic .

 the aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics  treatment  and prognosis of crbsi in the intensive care unit ( icu ) in a chinese center  as well as the risk factors for early crbsi . among the 73 crbsi patients enrolled in the present study  the major risk factors included advanced age  long - term catheter indwelling  parenteral nutrition  diabetes  and apache ii score > 23  and > 3 types of underlying diseases . 
 multivariate analysis showed that an acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii ( apache ii ) score > 20 and > 3 types of underlying diseases were independent factors associated with crbsi occurring within 14 days of cvc indwelling . 
 advanced age  long - term catheter indwelling  parenteral nutrition  diabetes  apache ii score > 23  and > 3 types of underlying diseases are well known risk factors of crbsi . 
 patients with advanced age and multiple underlying diseases and diabetes usually show decreased immune function . 
 our findings showed that significantly more subjects had catheter indwelling for 14 days compared with catheters indwelling for < 14 days . 
 the prolongation of catheterization by one day was reported to be associated with a 1.8-fold increased risk of crbsi . 
 early crbsi may have serious implications for the patients since it can interfere with patient treatment . 
 the results of the present study showed that poor patient condition  indicated by the apache ii score  and high number of disease types were independently associated with an early crbsi onset . 
 therefore  the prevention of crbsi should be for a priority in critically ill patients with complicated diseases . 
 indeed  the mortality rate from crbsi is reported to be 8.8% in subjects aged > 65 years  but only 3.8% in those aged < 65 years . 
 indeed  a large proportion of our patients had high apache ii scores and a large number of concomitant diseases . 
 accordingly  a previous study showed that the mortality rate due to crbsi in the icu was 28.1% in critically ill patients . 
 the present study demonstrated that the position of cvc indwelling was closely associated with the time of crbsi onset . 
 the longest mean duration of catheterization was found in the subclavian vein at crbsi onset  followed by the internal jugular vein . 
 the shortest duration was observed in the femoral vein  as observed by previous studies . 
 the skin at the subclavian vein is flat  which is easier to clean and disinfect  resulting in late crbsi onset . 
 accordingly  the subclavian vein is recommended as the first choice of the site for catheterization in the idsa guidelines  followed by the internal jugular vein and the femoral vein . 
 in addition  crbsi occurred later when using the single - lumen catheter than with double - lumen catheter . 
 indeed  a significantly higher occurrence of crbsi was observed with double - lumen catheters compared with single - lumen catheters . in the present study  the most common pathogens causing crbsi were gram - positive bacteria  followed by gram - negative bacteria and fungi . 
 cons were predominant in the gram - positive bacteria  followed by mrsa  with 85.7% of the staphylococci resistant to methicillin  and 41.7% of the enterococci resistant to vancomycin . 
 the most common gram - negative bacteria were acinetobacter baumannii  followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa  in which esbls - producing bacteria were 80.0% and 68.4%  respectively  resistant to carbapenem antibiotics . 
 the high prevalence of antibiotic - resistant bacteria may be associated with the wide use of broad - spectrum antibiotics in the icu . 
 candida albicans constituted only 42.9% of candida infections . in a systematic review of eligible studies related to crbsi associated with parenteral nutrition published between 1970 and march 2012  the major pathogens were staphylococcus spp .  followed by gram - negative bacillus and candida spp .  which was consistent with the current study findings 
 . however  the distribution of the causal agents in the present study was slightly different from that observed in the united states . therefore  the choice of empiric treatment should be made according to these possible geographical differences . 
 empirical selection of antibiotics should be based on patient clinical profile  such as recent history of antibiotic use  drug resistance or allergy  underlying diseases  clinical epidemiology  and health facility . 
 in addition  adequate anti - infective therapy for crbsi should be administered to prevent complications such as inflammatory deep venous thrombosis and infectious endocarditis . 
 the number of patients was small  and they all were from a single center . 
 no control group was included  preventing us from studying the risk factors for crbsi in china . however  the present study is the first to identify some risk factors for early crbsi onset . 
 apache ii score > 20 and the presence of > 3 types of diseases were associated with earlier crbsi onset . in this chinese center  
 critically ill patients in the icu should be particularly monitored for the appearance of crbsi .","

Abstract: The study examines crbsi in an intensive care unit in a Chinese center, focusing on clinical characteristics, treatment, and risk factors for early onset. Results showed gram-positive cocci as the predominant pathogen and identified high Apache II scores and multiple underlying diseases as independent factors for early onset.
 
Research and Discussion: The study found a high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and non-Candida albicans spp. in crbsi patients. Multivariate analysis revealed a correlation between an Apache II score >20 and the presence of >3 underlying diseases with earlier onset. Timely cvc removal and appropriate antibiotic use resulted in better outcomes.
 
Results and Conclusion: The study highlighted the predominance of gram-positive bacteria in crbsi cases and identified risk factors for early onset. Furthermore, timely cvc removal and proper antibiotic use were found to improve outcomes. The study underscores the importance of early identification and management of crbsi to prevent life-threatening complications."
"there is a critical need to develop potent 
 and selective therapeutic 
 agents capable of targeting malignant tissue without compromising 
 normal cell viability . 
 while chemotherapeutic agents ( e.g.  doxorubicin 
 and docetaxel ) remain widely used in the clinic  they lack inherent 
 selectivity desired to limit toxicity to normal cells . in addition  administration of chemotherapeutic agents 
 can induce drug resistance  resulting in disease progression . 
 thus  the development of more targeted therapies 
 could circumvent nonspecific interactions and potentially overcome 
 drug resistance in cancer therapy . 
 intriguing studies are currently 
 exploring new methods to engage 
 biomolecular targets with high affinity and specificity  including 
 the generation of multivalent and heterobifunctional constructs . 
 advances 
 in chemical synthesis techniques  such as cross - coupling and conjugation 
 strategies  have enabled chemists to decorate a plethora of molecular 
 species with targeting moieties  providing access to elaborate molecular 
 architectures that can be tailored to occupy distinct binding sites 
 within one or multiple biomacromolecules . 
 although these types of 
 compounds fall outside the molecular weight range of typical drug 
 compounds ( 5003000 da )  increasing interest in developing 
 new chemical entities that can modulate biomolecular targets in novel 
 ways and address selectivity requirements are emerging . to date 
  
 there have been only limited examples evaluating the potential 
 for targeting the androgen receptor ( ar ) with steroidal conjugates . 
 the ar is an important drug target for treatment of prostate cancer 
 and has been the subject of research for several decades . 
 a large 
 number of bioactive compounds targeting ar have been identified via 
 screening efforts . in this review  
 we 
 begin by providing a rationale for continued studies in prostate cancer 
 pharmacology targeting the ar . 
 particular focus is placed on examining 
 current approaches to specifically engage and modulate ar activity 
 with steroid conjugates utilizing rational design principles . 
 androgens are a class of steroid 
 hormones that consist of 19-carbon 
 derivatives of cholesterol and are synthesized by the testis and adrenal 
 glands . 
 they are also precursors for estrogens  
 the female sex hormones  produced by hydroxylation  elimination  and 
 aromatization of androgens through the enzyme aromatase . 
 functioning 
 primarily through the ar  which is a ligand - dependent transcription 
 factor  androgens play a fundamental role in the development and survival 
 of male reproductive tissues  such as the prostate  by influencing 
 gene expression levels . 
 the body 
 maintains control of testosterone ( the most abundant androgen 
 in men ) levels within a normal reference range of 240800 
 ng / dl . 
 low 
 levels of testosterone resulting from zinc deficiency or aging can 
 lead to fatigue and erectile dysfunction . 
 by contrast  high levels of testosterone have been linked to a variety 
 of diseases  including prostate cancer . 
 prostate cancer remains the most common cancer among men and 
 is 
 globally estimated to affect 900  000 patients every year . as the second leading cause of cancer - related 
 deaths in men ( 258  000/year )  approximately one out of every 
 six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in the u.s . 
 if detected 
 early  an arsenal of therapeutic options currently provide a promising 
 chance for long - term survival . 
 however  40% of patients will 
 develop castration - resistant prostate cancer ( crpc )  arising from 
 drug resistance ( vida infra )  which is associated with poor survival 
 rates . 
 the ar is a 110 kda protein that shares sequence 
 homology with 
 other nuclear hormone receptors in the superfamily  including the 
 progesterone receptor ( pr )  glucocorticoid receptor ( gr )  and estrogen 
 receptor ( er ) . 
 the ar consists of four 
 basic elements : n - terminal domain  dna binding domain  hinge region  
 and the ligand binding domain ( lbd ) . 
 the 
 first domain is the 559 amino acid long intrinsically disordered n - terminal 
 domain  which contains the ligand - independent activation function 
 1 ( af-1 ) . 
 activation function sites encode signature motifs containing 
 lxxll or fxxlf sequences to recruit co - regulatory proteins that are 
 essential for transcription . 
 the most highly conserved region within 
 all nuclear hormone receptors  including ar  is the centrally located 
 dna binding domain  consisting of two zinc finger domains that recognize 
 specific dna consensus sequences known as the androgen response elements 
 ( figure 1a ) . 
 the third domain  dubbed the hinge 
 region  connects the dna binding domain to the ligand - binding domain 
 ( figure 1b ) . the ligand - binding domain ( lbd ) 
 contains ligand - dependent activation function 2 ( af-2 )  forms the 
 ligand - binding pocket  and mediates interactions between the ar and 
 heat shock proteins ( figure 1b ) . 
 importantly  af-2 can interact with an fxxlf 
 binding motif located within the n - terminal domain  a feature unique 
 to ar .

 receptor ( ar ) dna binding 
 domain ( ribbon  red ) in complex with the androgen response elements 
 ( sticks  pdb code 1r4i ) and ( b ) ar ligand binding domain ( ribbon  gray ) and portion of 
 hinge region ( ribbon  blue ) in complex with native ligand ( sticks  
 green  pdb code 1i37 ) . 
 ( c ) amino acids residues that establish high affinity binding 
 with native ligand dht ( pdb code 2ama ) . 
 the crystal structure of the ar lbd bound to native ligand 
 ( dht ) 
 reveals the amino acid residues critical for maintaining high binding 
 affinity ( figure 1c ) . 
 although van der waals forces contribute to binding affinity  hydrogen 
 bonds establish stronger interactions with the native ligand . 
 arg752 forms a hydrogen bond with the o3 atom 
 ( ketone ) of the steroid ligand . 
 mutagenesis of arg752 has been shown 
 to compromise binding affinity  suggesting the importance of this 
 interaction for achieving high affinity . 
 in addition  asn705 and thr877 form hydrogen bonds with the 17- 
 hydroxyl group of the steroid ligand . 
 mutagenesis of asn705 and thr877 
 have also resulted in reduced binding affinity and specificity  establishing 
 their importance to maintaining high affinity . 
 it is important to note that modifications to the 17- hydroxyl 
 group can result in diminished binding affinity  while even large 
 substituent modifications at the 17- position often retain 
 strong binding interactions . 
 the ar is a ligand - dependent 
 transcription factor that is stabilized 
 in the cytoplasm by chaperone proteins ( figure 2 ) . 
 competitive displacement of the chaperones 
 by dihydrotestosterone ( dht )  an androgen biosynthesized from testosterone 
 through the enzyme 5-reductase  activates the ar . upon activation 
  a conformational change brings 
 the n- and c - termini into proximity and facilitates ar dimerization . upon translocation into the nucleus  ar binds to palindromic 5-tgttct-3 
 consensus sequences ( androgen response elements ) in the promoter regions 
 of target genes . 
 this event stimulates the recruitment 
 of necessary cofactors  including lxxll or fxxlf motif - containing 
 proteins  and other components of the transcriptional machinery to 
 regulate gene expression .

 dht  dihydrotestosterone ; hsp  heat shock protein ; p  phosphorylation 
 site ; fxxlf  coactivator protein . 
 the 
 ar mediates a variety of androgen - dependent diseases including 
 benign prostatic hypertrophy ( bph )  prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia 
 ( pin )  and prostate cancer . 
 it has been 
 proposed that prostate cancer often originates from high - grade prostatic 
 intraepithelial neoplasia ( hgpin )  a process in which subtle alterations 
 in the shape and size of prostate cells occur . 
 more importantly  progression 
 of prostate cancer has been linked to elevated expression of ar in 
 malignant tissue  suggesting that ar plays a central role in prostate 
 cancer cell biology . 
 although many hypotheses 
 regarding the involvement of ar in prostate cancer progression have 
 been postulated  the precise molecular mechanisms are not fully understood . 
 patients diagnosed with localized or metastatic prostate cancer 
 usually undergo androgen deprivation therapy ( reduction of circulating 
 androgen levels )  through chemical castration ( gonadotropin - releasing 
 hormone agonists ) or surgical castration . unfortunately  these methods do not completely eliminate circulating 
 levels of androgens  as the tumor itself is capable of local androgen 
 synthesis  due to the expression of androgen biosynthetic enzymes . 
 this has led to numerous research efforts focusing 
 on the development of inhibitors that interfere with key enzymes  
 such as cytochrome p450 17a1 ( cyp17a1 )  in androgen biosynthesis as 
 exemplified by the recent fda approval of abiraterone ( zytiga ) . 
 the standard treatment approach for prostate 
 cancer involves androgen 
 deprivation therapy in conjunction with small molecule anti - androgens 
 that block ar signaling ( figure 3a ) . 
 anti - androgens compete with dht for binding 
 to ar  thus inhibiting ar transactivation through a variety of mechanisms  
 including disruption of nuclear localization  interruption of dna 
 binding  and interference with coactivator recruitment . 
 unfortunately  most patients receiving anti - androgen therapy eventually 
 develop drug resistance as indicated by rising levels of serum prostate - specific 
 antigen ( psa )  a gene regulated by ar  leading to the lethal disease 
 state termed castration - resistant prostate cancer or crpc . 
 small molecule inhibitors targeting the ar : ( a ) anti - androgens ; 
 ( b ) activation function 2 inhibitors ; ( c ) allosteric ( bf3 site ) regulators ; 
 ( d ) n - terminal domain inhibitors . 
 purple denotes approved therapies 
 for androgen - dependent prostate cancer  and orange represents approved 
 therapies for castration - resistant prostate cancer . 
 current mechanisms proposed for advancement to 
 crpc include the 
 following:(1)alterations in ar co - regulatory protein 
 balance;(2)somatic gain 
 of function mutations 
 within ar  with the majority in the lbd  resulting in activation by 
 other steroid hormones and anti - androgens;(3)generation of new fusion gene products;(4)ar  ligand - independent 
 activation via cross - talk with other signaling pathways.these mechanisms have garnered significant attention because 
 of their ability to  reactivate  ar and disease progression  
 and provide a conceptual underpinning to guide development of new 
 therapeutic interventions . 
 nevertheless  currently crpc is primarily 
 treated with chemotherapeutic agents  immunotherapy  or abiraterone 
 ( vida supra ) . 
 alterations in ar co - regulatory protein 
 balance ; somatic gain 
 of function mutations 
 within ar  with the majority in the lbd  resulting in activation by 
 other steroid hormones and anti - androgens ; generation of new fusion gene products ; ar  ligand - independent  
 activation via cross - talk with other signaling pathways . 
 ar have been identified via chemical screening efforts and include 
 compounds that act on the af-2 ( figure 3b ) 
 or bf3 site ( figure 3c ) on ar to regulate its 
 activity . 
 the bf3 site is a hydrophobic binding pocket located adjacent to 
 af-2 on the surface of ar that can allosterically regulate binding 
 interactions between ar and coactivator proteins . 
 the development 
 of noncompetitive modulators ( that do not compete against dht for 
 ligand binding ) could circumvent drug resistance in ar pharmacology . 
 while promising  these noncompetitive approaches have yet to yield 
 candidates for clinical implementation  likely because of the high 
 concentrations required to suppress ar activity . in the future  it may be important to utilize structure - based 
 design to generate more potent af-2 or bf3 inhibitors . 
 in contrast  
 continuing interest in anti - androgen drug development 
 has led to the fda approval of enzalutamide  which targets the ar 
 ligand binding domain for the treatment of crpc ( figure 3a ) . 
 unfortunately  recent evidence 
 suggests that drug resistance to enzalutamide can emerge from point 
 mutations within the ar lbd  such as f876l . 
 additionally  drug resistance has been proposed to arise from constitutively 
 active ar splice variants lacking the ar ligand binding domain . 
 this has led researchers to focus on innovative 
 ways to antagonize ar splice variants and the development of n - terminal 
 domain inhibitors ( figure 3d ) . 
 it is important to note  however  that no structural information 
 exists for the ar n - terminal domain  complicating the design of n - terminal 
 domain antagonists . although it 
 is tempting to speculate that ar splice variants are 
 mainly responsible for drug resistance to enzalutamide  the precise 
 molecular mechanisms remain unknown . 
 evidence suggests that full - length 
 ar is required for signaling  although different sets of studies demonstrate 
 that er splice variants can be constitutively active in the absence 
 of ligand . 
 also  an intriguing report 
 has similarly suggested that the gr can become constitutively active 
 in the absence of its lbd . 
 future research 
 may illuminate whether other nuclear hormone receptors can exhibit 
 similar modes of action . 
 bioactive  hit  compounds  typically identified from 
 screening efforts  often lack the potency and selectivity required 
 for translation to a clinical setting . for this reason 
 compounds through 
 iterative rounds of synthesis and rigorous bioassays . while this strategy 
 remains widely utilized in both academic and industrial research programs  
 rational design of therapeutic agents aims to streamline these issues 
 by initially identifying more potent and selective compounds . 
 below  
 we describe different strategies that have been used to target ar 
 with steroid conjugates  along with preliminary evaluation of their 
 potential applications in ar pharmacology . 
 the 
 atp - dependent ubiquitin - proteasome pathway is a quality control mechanism 
 that conducts the programmed metabolic degradation of proteins . 
 ubiquitin - protein ligase ( e3 ) associates with 
 ubiquitin - conjugating enzyme ( e2 )  providing subsequent tagging of 
 ubiquitin chains to protein substrates that results in degradation 
 by the proteasome . 
 rational design strategies aimed toward selectively 
 targeting proteins for degradation through e3 could establish an approach 
 to diminish the levels of aberrantly functioning proteins . the 
 crews lab has pioneered a general strategy to modulate levels of selective 
 proteins by engagement of the ubiquitin system . by use of conjugates dubbed proteolysis targeting chimeric 
 molecules ( protacs )  the first steroid conjugate to selectively induce 
 ar degradation was developed . 
 protacs 
 consist of three components : a targeting moiety ( dht )  a linker  and 
 a recognition element for e3 . 
 the modular synthesis of protacs establishes 
 a significant pharmacological advantage because protacs are particularly 
 amenable to chemical modification  permitting control over the physicochemical 
 features of the products . 
 initial ex vivo studies aimed toward 
 degrading ar yielded protac-5 ( figure 4a ) . 
 protac-5 was outfitted with a peptide sequence 
 ( alapyip ) as an e3 recognition domain and to induce ubiquitination 
 upon hydroxylation of the central proline residue . to assess biological activity  
 protac-5 was administered 
 to human embryonic kidney cells ( hek293 ) that stably expressed an 
 ar fluorescent fusion protein . 
 protein degradation was quantified 
 by a reduction in the fluorescence signal . at a concentration of 25 
 m  protac-5 successfully degraded ar without compromising normal 
 cell viability . in control studies  
 vehicle treated cells maintain 
 fluorescence  suggesting that protac-5 engages ar in the cell and 
 induces degradation . 
 to confirm these results  cells were treated 
 with protac-5 and immunoblotted for ar . a significant decrease in 
 ar protein level

 more recently  a derivative of protac-5  dubbed protac - aa 
 ( figure 4b )  was administered to an ar - expressing 
 prostate 
 cancer cell line ( lncap ) to evaluate effects on cell proliferation . 
 protac - aa contains a shorter hydroxylated recognition 
 element for e3 and a slightly modified arginine tail to enhance cell 
 permeability . 
 the arginine tail enhances cell permeability through 
 an uptake mechanism mimicking the antennapedia and hiv tat proteins . 
 protac - aa inhibited cell growth with an inhibitory concentration 
 ( ic50 ) value of 3.8 m at 72 h and 0.217 m 
 at 144 h. a control protac lacking the arginine tail displayed ic50 values 12.5 m at 72 h and 1.5 m at 144 h. 
 western blot analysis was performed to establish that ar protein levels 
 were reduced . taken together  these results suggest that the arginine 
 tail enhances biological activity while maintaining specificity . 
 importantly  
 in prostate cancer cell lines that do not express ar ( pc-3 and du-145 
 cells )  protac - aa had no significant effect on cell viability  establishing 
 selective activity . while protacs remain promising candidates 
 for applications in ar 
 pharmacology  difficulties in large - scale production may impede rapid 
 translation into the clinic . 
 current efforts have focused on developing 
 more  druglike  protac molecules and the recent discovery 
 of the first small molecule targeting e3 ( figure 4c ) with an ic50 value of 4.1 m . 
 competitive fluorescence polarization data indicated 
 that the small molecule binds to e3  which was confirmed by a cocrystal 
 structure . 
 subsequent optimization led to the first submicromolar 
 small molecule targeting e3 ( ic50 = 0.90 m ) . in the future  we may begin to see small molecule 
 protacs targeting ar  which may include  for example  enzalutamide 
 tethered to similar small molecules that are capable of recruiting 
 e3 . 
 apoptosis  or programmed cell death  is a physiological 
 cell suicide mechanism critical to cellular homeostasis . 
 inadequate activation of the apoptotic pathway 
 can play a role in the development of cancer and autoimmune diseases . 
 inhibitors of apoptosis proteins ( iaps ) play 
 a fundamental role in regulating apoptosis and other cellular processes . 
 iaps contain a ring domain that possesses e3 activity  establishing 
 the ability to induce proteasomal degradation by tagging proteins 
 with ubiquitin chains . 
 the hashimoto 
 lab has developed specific and nongenetic iaps - dependent protein erasers 
 ( snipers ) . 
 relative to protacs  snipers 
 consist of a targeting moiety ( dht )  linker  and a recognition element 
 for iaps . 
 the targeted ubiquitination of proteins by snipers relies 
 on small molecule iap recognition elements ( figure 5 ) . 
 the biological activity of an ar targeting compound  sniper-13  
 was evaluated by western blot . in human mammary tumor ( mcf-7 ) 
 cells 
 that express ar  sniper-13 decreased ar protein levels at a concentration 
 of 30 m . the high concentration required to induce degradation 
 may be attributed to the hydrolytically unstable ester and oxime linkages . 
 chemical structure of specific and nongenetic 
 iaps dependent protein 
 eraser 13 ( sniper-13 ) . 
 the modular assembly of snipers allows for the incorporation 
 of 
 virtually any  targeting moiety  . 
 this characteristic  
 and the ability to recruit e3 with a small molecule  establishes a 
 versatile molecular platform to address many protein targets . in the 
 future 
  research efforts may focus on generating stable linkages between 
 the targeting moiety and the iap recognition element or altering linker 
 lengths to optimize activity of sniper conjugates against various 
 protein targets . 
 metallo - based 
 cytotoxic agents  
 such as cisplatin  remain a viable option for the treatment of cancer . from a mechanistic standpoint  
 these compounds 
 exert their biological activities by binding to nucleobases in dna 
 and inducing damage to dna that ultimately triggers apoptosis . 
 although widely used in the clinic  these agents 
 are generally nonspecific and exhibit shortcomings that include severe 
 side effects resulting from compromised normal cell viability and 
 drug resistance . 
 this has led to the exploration of metallo - based 
 chemotherapeutic agents that target specific organs or tumors to minimize 
 adverse side effects . 
 conjugation of a  targeting moiety  
 to metallo - based cytotoxic agents could potentially circumvent nonspecific 
 interactions by selectivity targeting cells that overexpress particular 
 proteins  establishing a delivery vector to localize the effects of 
 new therapeutic agents . 
 recent studies 
 from the hannon group have discovered the first metallo - based chemotherapeutic 
 conjugates to target ar . 
 the authors 
 developed an efficient protocol to readily synthesize an array of 
 steroid conjugates to act as delivery vehicles . 
 ethisterone  the 17-ethynyl 
 homologue of testosterone  was conjugated to pyridines  quinolines  
 and isoquinolines utilizing sonogashira cross - coupling conditions . 
 subsequent coordination to platinum(ii ) complexes yielded metallo - based 
 bifunctional agents ( figure 6 ) . 
 initial evaluation of the cytotoxic effects for the two most 
 promising 
 metallo - based bifunctional agents in cell lines that express ar ( t47d 
 cells ) revealed promising biological activity for a cis conjugate 
 ( ic50 = 15.9 m ) but not the trans conjugate ( ic50 = 63 m )  suggesting that the geometry of the platinum(ii ) 
 complexes plays a critical role . additionally  the cis conjugate exhibited 
 greater potency than cisplatin itself ( ic50 = 32 m ) . 
 cell uptake studies reveal that the  targeting moiety  
 enhances drug delivery  suggesting that the hydrophobic character 
 of ethisterone facilitates molecular transport across the cellular 
 membrane . 
 importantly  the presence of the  targeting moiety  
 in the cis conjugate ( relative to control compounds lacking steroid 
 moieties ) led to significant structural effects on dna . 
 the distortion of dna upon binding the cis conjugate 
 was greater than that observed for cisplatin  suggesting that the 
 steric bulk of ethisterone promotes greater unwinding of dna to accommodate 
 binding of the complex . 
 metallo - based conjugates have 
 significant utility as a platform 
 for targeted drug delivery . 
 the work outlined above suggests that 
 metallo - based conjugates can be crafted to exert toxic effects preferentially 
 on cell types that overexpress ar . 
  demonstration that 
 coadministration of a competitive ligand  such as dht  abrogates the 
 activity of the metallo - conjugate would further support the hypothesis 
 that targeting is mediated specifically through binding to ar . 
 ultimately  
 similar strategies could potentially be elaborated for targeting additional 
 metallo - conjugates to a range of malignant cell types  while mitigating 
 cytotoxic effects on other tissues . 
 alkylating agents act through 
 dna damaging mechanisms and are commonly used in cancer therapy . 
 crafting alkylating therapies to specifically target malignant 
 cells could minimize cytotoxic effects to normal cells and lead to 
 the development of potent anticancer agents . in an effort to 
 block dna repair enzymes  
 the essigmann group has developed heterobifunctional 
 dna - damaging agents to specifically target prostate cancer cells ( figure 7 ) . 
 the alkylating agent n  n - bis-2-chloroethylaniline was linked 
 to a steroid hormone that targets ar  allowing the conjugate to simultaneously 
 bind ar and dna . 
 this strategy results in the blockade of dna repair 
 enzymes in prostate cancer cells that overexpress ar  subsequently 
 leading to the disruption of ar - mediated transcription and signaling . 
 using radiometric competitive binding assays  the relative binding 
 affinity of n 
  n - bis-2-chloroethylaniline 
 was determined to be 20% for ar and 4.2% for pr . 
 this result 
 establishes that the conjugate is more selective for ar than pr . in 
 addition  only n  n - bis-2-chloroethylaniline  
 and not the negative control ( n  n - bis-2-methoxyethylaniline )  covalently modified dna . 
 administration 
 of the alkylating agent at a concentration of 10 m induced 
 apoptosis  as determined by flow cytometry and cleavage of poly adp - ribose 
 polymerase ( parp ) in western blot analysis . 
 as expected  the negative 
 control did not induce apoptosis at an equivalent concentration . 
 more 
 importantly  xenograft studies in immunocompromised mice revealed 
 90% inhibition of tumor growth through intraperitoneal injection ( daily 
 dose of 30 mg / kg ) . 
 these results demonstrate the effectiveness of 
 using targeted alkylating agents to selectively suppress prostate 
 cancer tumor growth . 
 an emerging avenue in molecular 
 pharmacology is the development of multivalent therapeutic agents . 
 multivalency can be used to establish enhanced binding affinity  termed 
 avidity  and specificity for corresponding biomolecular targets through 
 multisite binding contacts . displaying 
 ligands or 
 targeting moieties  on modular oligomer 
 frameworks allows chemists to precisely craft architectures capable 
 of inhibiting highly specific protein 
 in addition  the ability to create monodisperse 
 molecular scaffolds enables control over important physicochemical 
 features of the products  including solubility and cellular uptake . 
 peptoids are a class of peptidomimetics 
 composed of n - substituted glycine units joined through tertiary amide 
 linkages . 
 peptoids have recently been exploited as multivalent platforms 
 to design conjugates capable of targeting different nucleic acids 
 and protein receptors . 
 peptoids are stable against proteases and display 
 enhanced cell permeability profiles . the incorporation 
 of over 200 different peptoid side chains has enabled numerous applications 
 in chemistry and biology  including enantioselective catalysis  molecular 
 recognition  antimicrobial activity  intracellular delivery  and antitumor 
 activity in vivo . 
 peptoids are compatible with solid - phase synthesis techniques and 
 can be assembled in a sequence - specific manner to afford monodisperse 
 products . 
 additionally  the conformation 
 of peptoid oligomers can be controlled though macrocyclic constraints 
 and side chain interactions . utilizing peptoids 
 as a versatile chemical platform  the kirshenbaum 
 lab designed multivalent ethisterone conjugates to specifically target 
 the ar ldb and modulate ar activity via different mechanisms of action . 
 ethisterone was conjugated at the 17- 
 position to the peptoid scaffold via highly stable triazole linakges . 
 initial efforts evaluated effects of valency  spacing  and conformational 
 ordering on ar activity ( figure 8) . 
 fluorescence 
 polarization assays were conducted to determine if the conjugates 
 compete against dht for binding to the ar ligand binding domain . 
 results 
 from these studies revealed that hexavalent ( 4 ) and spaced 
 divalent conjugates ( 5 and 6 ) compete for 
 binding . 
 mono-  di-  and trivalent conjugates ( 13 ) and a cyclic divalent conjugate ( 7 ) did not 
 compete for ar binding . a control peptoid conjugate outfitted with 
 pr ligands did not activate ar in a luciferase reporter assay  suggesting 
 the ethisterone conjugates are selective for ar . in cell proliferation 
 studies that model castration - resistant prostate cancer ( lncap - abl 
 cells )  conjugates 6 and 7 exhibited potent 
 antiproliferative properties . 
 as expected  the anti - androgen bicalutamide 
 ( vide supra ) failed to suppress proliferation in this resistant cell 
 line . 
 importantly  cytotoxic effects of conjugates 6 and 7 were not observed in cell lines that do not express ar ( pc-3 
 and hek293 cells )  establishing that conjugates selectively target 
 ar . 
 figure 
 is adapted from ref ( 90 ) . in a follow - up investigation 
  
 the authors used confocal microscopy  
 time - resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer  chromatin immunoprecipitation  
 flow cytometry  and microarray analysis to gain insight into the mechanism 
 of action for conjugates 6 and 7 . 
 upon administration of conjugates 6 and 7 to hek293 cells transfected with an ar fluorescent 
 fusion protein  conjugate 6 did not promote ar nuclear 
 localization while conjugate 7 did  suggesting competitive 
 and noncompetitive mechanisms of action  respectively . 
 ar coactivator 
 recruitment assays revealed that conjugate 6 did not 
 promote binding between ar and coactivator proteins while conjugate 7 partially recruited coactivator proteins . in dna binding 
 experiments  both conjugates 6 and 7 reduced 
 the occupancy of ar to the psa enhancer ( vida supra ) . 
 conjugate 7  but not conjugate 6  induced arrest in the 
 g0/g1 phase of the cell - cycle and displayed 
 contrasting patterns in global gene expression . 
 intriguingly  conjugate 6 and 7 share extensive chemical similarities  
 indicating that the disposition of the ligand presentation on the 
 scaffolds can exert a significant influence on the mechanism of action . 
 conjugate 6 did not promote ar nuclear localization or 
 coactivator binding and inhibited dna binding . 
 in contrast  conjugate 7 promoted ar nuclear localization and induced cell - cycle 
 arrest through a noncompetitive mode of action . 
 the modularity 
 of peptoid synthesis establishes a versatile chemical 
 platform to generate an array of three - dimensional architectures to 
 target and modulate the activity of different biomolecular targets . 
 generation of peptidomimetic conjugates capable of antagonizing ar 
 via distinct mechanisms of action could circumvent drug resistance 
 in ar pharmacology . 
 peptoids offer a chemical platform that can be 
 utilized to optimize biological activity and hold significant promise 
 as next generation therapeutics for prostate cancer . 
 the estrogen receptor ( er ) has 
 a well - characterized mechanism of 
 action . 
 it is known that native ligand ( estradiol ) binding to the 
 er ligand binding domain induces a conformational rearrangement that 
 promotes dimerization  as determined by site - specific mutational analysis . 
 additionally  x - ray crystal structures of er 
 dimers in the presence of ligand and other er modulators have been 
 reported  establishing a template for molecular design by elucidating 
 the structural parameters of the er dimer complex . 
 pioneering work from the katzenellenbogen lab has probed er 
 function 
 with various bivalent conjugates tethered by different linkers . using high - resolution structural information  
 the first steroidal constructs aimed toward targeting the er dimer 
 initial studies 
 focused on developing a correlation between linker length and binding 
 affinity . 
 the authors concluded that bivalent conjugates incorporating 
 a 35  linker were most suitable for enhancing er binding 
 affinity . 
 steroidal bivalent conjugates modulate estrogen receptor ( er ) activity 
 through bivalent binding interactions . 
 crystal structure of the er 
 ligand binding domain ( gray ribbon  pdb code 1ere ) is bound to native 
 ligand ( estradiol  red spheres ) . 
 nonsteroidal bivalent conjugates 
 that induce 
 agonistic and antagonistic er conformations ( figure 10 ) were designed and synthesized in order to distinguish intra- 
 from intermolecular binding events . 
 bivalent 
 agonist conjugates displayed weak binding affinity  presumably due 
 to burial of the hydrophilic linker within the protein interior . 
 in 
 contrast  it was determined that antagonist conjugates incorporating 
 a 14.4  linker induced an intramolecular binding event ( i.e.  
 one targeting moiety optimized for competitive binding and the other 
 for binding to additional hydrophobic pockets such as activation function 
 2  figure 11 ) . 
 additionally  a 29  linker 
 was found to induce an intermolecular binding event . 
 increases in 
 linker length above 29  resulted in reducing binding affinities  
 presumably due to unfavorable entropic effects . 
 importantly  most 
 antagonistic nonsteroidal bivalent conjugates were more potent at 
 inhibiting cell proliferation in breast cancer cells ( mcf7 ) than a 
 monovalent pharmacophore control . 
 er conformation is dependent upon ligand 
 binding : ( a ) er bound 
 in an agonist conformation ( gray ribbon ; diethylstilbestrol  colored 
 spheres ; helix-12 in orange ; coactivator peptide in red ; pdb code 3erd ) ; ( b ) er bound in 
 an antagonist conformation ( gray ribbon ; hydroxytamoxifen  colored 
 spheres ; helix-12 in orange ; pdb code 3ert ) . 
 diagram depicting intra- and intermolecular er binding events that 
 are dependent on linker length . 
 a critical objective from a molecular design approach is 
 the ability 
 to induce different er conformations that are dependent upon ligand 
 binding . 
 as discussed above  the conformation induced upon agonist 
 or antagonist ligand binding to er ( figure 10 ) plays a critical role in the biological outcome . in an antagonist 
 conformation  an intra- or intermolecular binding event can occur 
 between two distinct  targeting moieties  . 
 an open question 
 is whether structure - based design can be utilized to generate heterobifunctional 
 conjugates that target two distinct binding sites on ar ( i.e.  one 
 targeting moiety optimized for competitive binding at the ligand binding 
 domain and the other for binding to an additional hydrophobic pocket  
 such as af-2 or bf3 ) . 
 over the past decade  targeting canonical or membrane - associated 
 ar with heterobifunctional or multivalent constructs displaying anti - androgen 
 drug ligands has emerged as a potential family of therapeutics . 
 these 
 compound classes hold great promise as effective therapeutic agents 
 due to their ability to modulate ar activity through unique mechanisms 
 of action . because of the large number of reports  
 we highlight only 
 a few representative examples of promising strategies that have been 
 used to target ar with nonsteroidal conjugates . 
 recently  the 
 oyelere lab reported a nonsteroidal heterobifunctional 
 conjugate outfitted with histone deacetylase inhibitors ( figure 12a ) . 
 histone deacetylase 
 inhibitors show great promise in preclinical cancer models  but their 
 inability to selectively target malignant tissue has restricted therapeutic 
 development . by conjugating histone deacetylase inhibitors to nonsteroidal 
 anti - androgen ligands  selective modulation of ar activity at concentrations 
 lower than clinical anti - androgens was achieved . 
 these results introduce 
 a novel method to antagonize the ar and pave the way for next generation 
 therapeutics . 
 nonsteroidal conjugates targeting ar : ( a ) chemical structure 
 of 
 heterobifunctional conjugate displaying histone deacetylase inhibitor 
 linked to a nonsteroidal antiandrogen ligand ; ( b ) chemical structure 
 of heterobifunctional conjugate displaying doxorubicin linked to a 
 nonsteroidal antiandrogen ligand ; ( c ) schematic depiction of a multivalent 
 gold nanoparticle displaying nonsteroidal antiandrogen ligands that 
 target membrane - associated ar 
 . figure is obtained from refs ( 98 )  ( 99 )  and ( 101 ) . in similar studies  the koch lab reported a nonsteroidal 
 heterobifunctional 
 conjugate containing doxorubicin  a nonselective cytotoxic therapeutic 
 dna intercalator used in the clinic ( figure 12b ) . to enhance selectivity  
 doxorubicin was 
 conjugated to a nonsteroidal anti - androgen ligand through a salicylamide 
 linker that can be hydrolyzed ( t1/2 = 
 57 min under physiological conditions ) to yield a doxorubicin  formaldehyde 
 schiff base . 
 the anti - androgen conjugate successfully delivered the 
 doxorubicin - formaldehyde schiff base to cells overexpressing ar  highlighting 
 the ability of this approach to enhance selectivity by releasing the 
 pharmacophore in prostate cancer cells . 
 lastly  the el - sayed 
 lab introduced the first nonsteroidal multivalent 
 conjugates that selectively target membrane - associated ar ( figure 12c ) . 
 bicalutamide 
 was conjugated to gold nanoparticles  generating architectures that 
 display approximately ( 2.25  0.02 )  10 ligands / particle . 
 the multivalent compounds enhanced potency by 1 order of magnitude  
 in comparison to the monovalent ligand  in prostate cancer cells . 
 these results establish that conjugation of numerous copies of a known 
 pharmacophore to a molecular scaffold can significantly increase antiproliferative 
 effects and may overcome resistance that arises from monovalent treatment . 
 there is a growing appreciation for the design of potent and selective 
 therapeutic agents targeting the ar for prostate cancer patients . 
 targeted drug therapy is beginning to play a pivitol role in new drug 
 discovery efforts . 
 classically  small molecules identified via chemical 
 screening efforts have been considered to offer a relatively straightforward 
 path for clinical implementation . in certain cases  
 extensive high - resolution 
 structural information enables structure  activity relationship 
 profiles that can be utilized for optimization  facilitating translation 
 into the clinic . 
 unfortunately  their therapeutic responses can be 
 short - lived because of acquired resistance . 
 the studies highlighted 
 in this review indicate how new chemical 
 entities are being designed to engage ar with high potency . 
 additional preclinical 
 studies will be required to validate their potential for clinical 
 translation . in many cases 
  it will be necessary to evaluate critical 
 parameters such as selectivity  in vivo potency  and binding affinity . 
 as discussed  chemical modifications at certain positions on the steroid 
 core can result in diminished binding affinities  potentially limiting 
 their utility in ar pharmacology . 
 these molecular architectures 
 have been demonstrated to elicit 
 potent biological responses and more importantly target the ar in 
 novel ways . in the future  we may begin to see examples of monodisperse 
 homo- and heterogeneous bivalent or multivalent displays in which 
 high - resolution structural data enable evaluation of structure  activity 
 relationships that have propelled many small molecule drug discovery 
 efforts . 
 more importantly  heterobifunctional displays will likely 
 be designed to target two distinct binding sites on ar  enhancing 
 potency and establishing new modes of ar antagonism . 
 these constructs 
 could potentially address the challenge of overcoming resistance in 
 prostate cancer patients .","


Abstract:
The androgen receptor (AR) is a key target for prostate cancer therapy due to its role in cancer progression. This review summarizes strategies for creating potent, selective AR-targeted drugs, including nonsteroidal conjugates. The potential applications and future prospects of these drugs are also discussed.

Research and Discussion:
Elevated AR expression in prostate cancer has led to a focus on developing drugs that specifically target this receptor. Nonsteroidal conjugates show promise in this regard, with several strategies currently under investigation. These drugs have the potential to effectively treat prostate cancer with minimal systemic toxicity.

Results and Conclusion:
The development of potent, selective AR-targeted drugs has the potential to revolutionize prostate cancer treatment. Nonsteroidal conjugates show promise in precisely targeting AR, potentially avoiding the side effects associated with non-specific chemotherapies. Further research and development in this area will pave the way for more effective and targeted therapies for prostate cancer."
"for patients with acute coronary syndrome ( acs )  the key to increased survival and the preservation of myocardial function is rapid diagnosis followed by appropriate early intervention  which will enable timely management strategies and intervention to be carried out . 
 delays at any level of management  from the prehospital setting to the emergency department ( ed ) and  subsequently  to the cardiac catheterisation laboratory  must be minimised . 
 the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction requires the combination of a good and prompt clinical history  a 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ecg ) and also appropriate cardiac markers ( in cases of st - elevation ami [ stemi ]  the results of cardiac markers will not be required for decisions on management and intervention ) [ 15 ] . 
 prehospital 12-lead ecgs are now being performed and transmitted to eds to save precious time in diagnosis . 
 institutions set targets where the door - to - ecg time should not exceed 10 min  the door - to - needle time must be within 30 min and the door - to - intervention time should be within 90 min of arrival [ 611 ] . 
 the acquisition of a 12-lead ecg is an important step to assess the cardiac status in routine and emergency situations . in a cardiac emergency  
 the time and accuracy of information are important elements that have a critical effect on patient outcomes . 
 accurate ecg measurements are essential for diagnostic purposes  as well as serial comparison to evaluate changes in cardiac status and help in the prediction of future events . in clinical practice  the relevance of the ecg depends upon its reproducibility in an individual . with all of these points in mind 
 the application of single - lead electrodes to the torso for standard 12-lead ecg acquisition takes time . 
 a relatively new praecordial v1v6  v - quick patch  has been developed and it provides a one - piece template for the placement of all six praecordial leads  which makes application easy . 
 the person performing the 12-lead ecg need only to reach out for one single item to be applied to the patient s torso  instead of six separate pieces of items  as in the traditional case . 
 the patch has characteristics that enable it to conform to variations in thoracic dimensions while retaining the ability of providing accurate electrode placement . 
 training in the use of this new patch requires a minimal amount of time  as the template provides cues to the user on placement as it is being performed . 
 the v - quick patch has the potential to be used anywhere and in any setting where a 12-lead ecg is carried out . 
 this study will assess : 
 the time required to obtain a 12-lead ecg using the v - quick patch system versus the standard single - electrode systemthe agreement between the 12-lead ecgs acquired by both techniques as assessed by two assessors the time required to obtain a 12-lead ecg using the v - quick patch system versus the standard single - electrode system the agreement between the 12-lead ecgs acquired by both techniques as assessed by two assessors the null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between the times taken and the level of agreement or quality of the ecgs acquired by the two different techniques . 
 one hundred and fifty each of healthy male and female volunteers  at least 18  years of age  with various body builds and weights were enrolled . 
 any volunteer who was incidentally found to have significant ecg changes were given an appointment with a cardiologist for the necessary evaluation . 
 preparation consisted of cleaning the skin with alcohol wipes at the site for lead placement . 
 electrodes were placed in the routine standard positions for the single - electrode 12-lead ecg . 
 following the removal of the standard electrodes  the v - quick template was attached to the praecordium for the acquisition of the next 12-lead ecg . 
 this was done using their unique identification number ( in ) and if this number ended with an even digit  they would have the v - quick technique ecg performed first . 
 the volunteers may experience some minor dermatological effects from the applications and removal of the electrodes 
 the time was measured with a stopwatch from the instance the lead application commenced for both techniques . for the v - quick technique  this would be from the moment the staff tears the pack open and for the standard method  it would be from the time the staff picks up the card of the single - electrode adhesive . 
 the stopwatch was stopped once the last electrode had been applied satisfactorily and the ecg printout was complete . 
 the two ecgs acquired by the different techniques  on the same volunteer  was performed by the same staff . 
 the two ecgs were then compared in a blinded fashion by two senior emergency physicians . 
 both the inter - assessor ( consistency between the two readers of the ecgs ) and intra - assessor ( same interpretation for both ecgs in the same volunteer ) agreement were analysed . 
 the following cases were excluded :

 in the next phase  we plan to include all patients requiring ecg presenting to the ed . 
 an agilent pagewriter 300pi and hewlett packard pagewriter xli was used to obtain all of the ecgs . 
 these machines utilise a computerised analysis system and were the ones used in the ed . 
 the v - quick patch system is packaged with one guide template with the four replaceable limb lead electrodes . 
 the electrodes were pre - gelled for a simple peel - and - stick application . 
 the guide template has the flexibility to accommodate different body sizes and geometries by allowing the movement of each ( praecordial ) electrode along the guide to attain the best suit for the recommended position ( figs .  1 and 2 ) .

 in the next phase  we plan to include all patients requiring ecg presenting to the ed . 
 an agilent pagewriter 300pi and hewlett packard pagewriter xli was used to obtain all of the ecgs . 
 these machines utilise a computerised analysis system and were the ones used in the ed . 
 the v - quick patch system is packaged with one guide template with the four replaceable limb lead electrodes . 
 the electrodes were pre - gelled for a simple peel - and - stick application . 
 the guide template has the flexibility to accommodate different body sizes and geometries by allowing the movement of each ( praecordial ) electrode along the guide to attain the best suit for the recommended position ( figs .  1 and 2 ) .

 the ecg continues to be a critical component of the evaluation of patients with emergency cardiac symptoms . 
 this tool is now more than a hundred years old and has been a standard in clinical practice for more than half a century . 
 the applications of new signal processing techniques and the expansion of the use of additional leads and innovative techniques have offered more information on cardiac electrical activity . 
 even though it is one of the most common tests being performed today  there are hardly any published studies on the time taken to acquire it . 
 often  ecgs are acquired by ecg technicians or nurses who  over the years  have become very versatile and familiar with the importance of accurate lead placement according to the thoracic landmarks . 
 there has also been developments with the aim of making praecordial lead placement easier and faster . 
 the v - quick technique showed a favourable result from this study in terms of timing  as well as agreement with the standard 12-lead ecg in 300 normal volunteers . 
 the technique is simple and the skill relatively easy to acquire when one already knows the concept of the 12-lead ecg . 
 the fact that the template is manufactured to fit the average standard size adult torso will make adjustment rarely necessary . 
 however  having said that  the onus will still lie with the operator carrying out the ecg to strive for the most accurate placement . 
 besides accuracy  timing is the other important factor  as we all try to meet the targets of door - to - ecg time at our institutions . 
 it is important to highlight that there are multiple factors that affect this timing : how busy the department is at any particular point in time  the first contact time or triage time  manpower and staffing issues  as well as the availability of ecg machines throughout the ed  among other factors . 
 it is  thus  crucial for each institution to look at the wider picture when trying to address timing issues to meet key performance indicators ( kpis ) . in female volunteers  the longer time required can be explained by the presence of breast tissue  which requires more attention to be paid to the standard landmarks and whether the leads should be placed over or under the breast tissue . 
 comparatively  with one template to deal with  it is still faster to apply the v - quick system rather than to apply the leads singly over the praecordium  as shown in this study . in this study  
 the v - quick system gave a stable baseline on ecg recordings  unlike some techniques such as the ecg belt  where this was a common problem . 
 praecordial electrode position is important  as the variability in placement may result in ecg changes . here  the nurses performing the ecgs on every individual marked the points of application with a skin marker to reduce the variability in placement between the two techniques . 
 . there has been increasing practice to place the limb leads on the torso itself  as this has been thought to reduce the application time . 
 however  it has been shown to have significant amplitude and waveform changes when compared to the ecg acquired with the limb leads placed in the usual recommended limb positions [ 19  20 ] . 
 this trial was a first of its kind conducted in singapore using the v - quick patch system . 
 looking at the results and also from past experience of the utilisation of the system  it appears to be very useful for consideration for use in the prehospital environment  where conditions are more unpredictable and stressful . as it is relatively easy to apply  
 using it whilst in a moving ambulance will also be less of a challenge when compared to the application of the small  single adhesives that the paramedics would have to apply at six different sites over the praecordium . 
 many prehospital patients are also cold  clammy and sweaty and  very often  the adhesives from these small electrodes do not work well . 
 this is where the one  single  larger template of the v - quick system would be a plus point . 
 we will  in future  consider a trial using the v - quick system in all patients who present to the ed and also the prehospital group of patients requiring a 12-lead ecg . 
 the v - quick patch was manufactured by a us - based company and it is likely the standardisation of the template was for the average american torso size . in this study  
 the template system was applied to asian volunteers . in the application  adjustments had to be made to the template  thus  creating more 
 this may have been due to the slightly smaller chest expanse of the average asian compared to their caucasian counterpart . in the data collection  the distances between v2v4 and v4v6 
 were noted  as these were thought to be useful as a simple measure of chest or thoracic expanse . 
 the shirt size may too be a reflection of this  but may be less constant or objective  as it would be very much affected by personal choice . 
 the same goes for female volunteers  where the bra cup size may reflect breast tissue size and volume . 
 if such similar studies were to be conducted in the caucasian population  it would be interesting to see the results and compare them to ours . in this trial  
 the nurses performing the ecgs were not blinded  as this would have been impossible to achieve . 
 it would have been optimal to do so  except for the fact that  logistically  it was rather challenging and would have incurred the extra cost of videotaping . 
 in this study of 300 male and female volunteers  the v - quick patch system was proved to be significantly faster than the single - electrode standard 12-lead system for the acquisition of electrocardiograms ( ecgs ) . 
 the time taken was also faster in male compared to female volunteers for the reasons discussed .","


Abstract: This paper compares the V-Quick Patch template system with the standard 12-lead ECG acquisition technique. The study looks at the time taken to produce a printed ECG and the level of agreement between two independent assessors. 

Research and Discussion: The study involved 150 male and 150 female volunteers who were trained in the V-Quick Patch system. The results showed that this system was significantly faster than the standard technique. Additionally, there was a 100% agreement between assessors when comparing ECGs obtained through both techniques. 

Results and Conclusion: The V-Quick Patch system was found to be faster than the standard 12-lead technique in both male and female volunteers. The level of agreement between assessors was also high. This suggests that the V-Quick Patch system is a feasible and reliable option for ECG acquisition."
"phrynoderma  meaning toad skin  is a type of follicular keratosis coined and described by nocholls in 1933 . 
 various nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin ( vit ) a  vit b - complex  vit e and essential fatty acid ( efa ) deficiency  as well as protein - calorie malnutrition have been suggested as possible etiological factors . 
 most of the studies on phrynoderma were conducted in the early and middle of the last century . 
 therefore  clinical features of phrynoderma and its association with nutritional deficiency signs were studied to elucidate the relationship between phrynoderma and nutritional status of patients . 
 a cross - sectional descriptive study of 125 consecutive phrynoderma patients attending the outpatient department ( opd ) of dermatology was conducted in a tertiary care hospital during a period of two years . in all patients  a detailed history with particular reference to age  gender  seasonal variations  socioeconomic status  and family history of disease and 
 cutaneous examination findings such as distribution  sites of involvement  morphology of the lesions  and signs of nutritional deficiencies were noted . 
 phrynoderma was diagnosed clinically if a patient presents with discrete  brown or skin colored  acuminate  keratotic papules with central keratin plug predominantly distributed over elbows  knees  extensor extremities  and/or buttocks . 
 all patients with phrynoderma examined by the investigator  irrespective of age and gender  were included in the study . 
 the proportion of patients with phrynoderma attending opd was 0.51% . among 125 patients  79 ( 63.2% ) were male and 46 ( 36.8% )  female . 
 the age of the patients was in the range of 3 - 26 years  with a mean of 10  4.3 years [ table 1 ] . 
 a majority of the patients ( 88% ) were from low socioeconomic group and the remaining ( 12% ) were from middle socioeconomic group . 
 phrynoderma was common in students ( 94.4% )  followed by lactating mothers ( 4.8% ) and laborers ( 0.8% ) . 
 the disease was recurrent in 17 ( 13.6% ) patients . during a calendar year  8.33% of the patients presented during summer  46.7% in the rainy  and 45% in winter season . 
 age distribution of phrynoderma cases the lesions were asymptomatic in 114 ( 91.2% ) patients and mild itching was present in 11 ( 8.8% ) patients . 
 the disease was localized ( elbows  knees  extensor extremities  and/or buttocks ) in 106 ( 84.8% ) patients and generalized ( trunk and/or face ) in 19 ( 15.2% ) patients . 
 elbows and buttocks alone were affected in 16 ( 12.8% ) and 2 ( 1.6% ) patients  respectively [ table 2 ] . 
 the site of onset was elbows in 106 ( 84.8% ) patients  followed by knees ( 8% )  buttocks ( 4% )  and extensor extremities ( 4% ) . 
 in all ( 100% ) patients  the lesions were discrete  keratotic  acuminate  and brown to skin colored papules with central keratinous plug [ figure 1 ] . 
 the surrounding skin was dry and scaly in 44 ( 35.2% ) patients and pigmented in 72 ( 57.6% ) patients . various diseases or conditions 
 sites of involvement in phrynoderma discrete brown to skin colored keratotic  follicular  acuminate papules with central keratinous plug localized to elbows associated diseases or conditions in phrynoderma histopathological changes in phrynoderma 
 phrynoderma is a disease occurring in children and adolescents aged between 5 and 15 years . 
 the disease is uncommon ( < 5% ) in children below 5 years of age . in the present study  
 thus  increased nutritional demand during childhood and lactation  and the lack of good nutrition due to low socioeconomic status may be responsible for occurrence of phrynoderma in these patients . 
 the proportion of phrynoderma cases in the present study is less compared to other studies where it was found to be 1.3%  3%  and 5% . 
 these studies were conducted in the middle of last century . the decline in the proportion of phrynoderma patients over the past few decades 
 therefore  nutrition seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of phrynoderma . in many studies including the present one  the family history of phrynoderma was very low ( 0%  3.57%  and 5% ) . 
 the absence of the disease in siblings who are also taking the same diet suggests the role of other factors in the manifestation of phrynoderma . 
 the distribution and site of onset of lesions indicate importance of pressure and friction in the development of lesions . 
 the incidence of phrynoderma is higher in the cooler months of the year  as is documented in the present study . 
 the flare up of the disease duirng winter may be due to follicular prominence  which generally occurs in otherwise normal children during cold weather . 
 the typical case of phrynoderma presents with bilaterally symmetrical discrete  keratotic  follicular  brown or skin colored  acuminate papules with central keratinous plug localized to elbows  knees  buttocks  and extensor extremities . in generalized disease 
 these distinct clinical features help in differentiating phrynoderma from other common follicular keratotic disorders such as keratosis pilaris  lichen spinulosis  pityriasis rubra pilaris  and follicular lichen planus . although the occurrence of phrynoderma has been related to nutritional status of the patient  in the present study  the signs and symptoms of nutritional deficiency 
 the ocular manifestations of vit a deficiency in patients with phrynoderma have been reported to be 5% . 
 it has also been demonstrated that the incidence of phrynoderma is less where the prevalence of signs of vit a deficiency is high and vice versa . 
 extremely low levels of serum vit a  0.1 mol / l ( normal  1.4 - 4 mol / l ) has been reported secondary to vit a malabsorption  following small bowel bypass surgery for obesity  colectomy  and in pancreatic insufficiency . 
 diet survey and serum vit a levels in apparently healthy phrynoderma patients and normal controls revealed no statistically significant difference between the two groups . 
 the vit a deficiency as a cause of phrynoderma was largely based on the therapeutic response to cod liver oil  which was considered to be a source of vit a. however  later it has also been demonstrated as a source of efa . 
 the patients presenting with signs of vit b - complex deficiency were less in number when compared to other studies ( 47.6%  50%  65%  92%  and 25% ) . 
 none of the patients in the present study presented with nutritional deficiency signs of efa  vit e  and vit c or protein calorie malnutrition . regarding efa intake in india 
  the computation based on revised figures of fat content in cereals and pulses has shown that the invisible fat present even in the poorest of indian diet provides minimum amount of linoleic acid needed  ie  3% of total energy . 
 the ratio of eicosatrienoic acid and arachidonic acid > 0.4 is considered as an accurate indicator of efa deficiency . 
 the studies showing efa deficiency in phrynoderma patients used alkaline isomerization ( ai ) method for estimation of fatty acid levels . in ai  
 the fatty acids are estimated according to the number of double bonds and their chain length is not taken into consideration  thereby overestimating the dienoic and trienoic acids  and underestimating the tetraenoic and pentaenoic acids . 
 this results in high trienoic to tetraenoic acid ratio . in gas exchange chromatography ( gc ) method  fatty acids are estimated according to both double bonds and chain length . thus  the ratio obtained by gc method reflects efa deficiency . in phrynoderma patients  
 the levels of linoleic acid and phospholipids ( sensitive indicators of efa deficiency )  and ratio of linoleic to arachidonic acid ( indicator of efficient conversion of linoleic acid to arachidonic acid ) were also normal in phrynoderma patients . 
 the cutaneous manifestations of riboflavin  pyridoxine  niacin  and efa deficiency states have a number of similarities . 
 riboflavin is required for pyridoxine metabolism  which  in turn  is required for tryptophan - niacin metabolism  and niacin is necessary for fatty acid synthesis . 
 the combination therapy of vit b - complex and efa or vit b - complex and vit e have shown better results when compared to single drug therapy . 
 the serum levels of linoleic acid and vit e also increased significantly during the combination therapy . 
 vitamins of b - complex group when used alone failed to show any therapeutic response . 
 in addition  deficiency of a single vitamin of b - complex group is rare because poor nutritional diets or malabsorption are more often associated with multiple nutritional deficiencies . 
 impaired balance or threshold levels of these nutrients with or without a deficiency state seem to alter the intersecting biochemical pathways and the local milieu of these nutrients resulting in phrynoderma . 
 this can be compared with the formation of comedones in acne where a low level of linoleic acid in sebum has been attributed in the pathogenesis of follicular hyperkeratinization . 
 follicular hyperkeratosis with keratin plugging along with epidermal hyperkertosis and acanthosis are the characteristic features of phrynoderma . 
 the clinical and histopathological skin changes closely resembling those of phrynoderma have been noted in rats  which were fed with fat - deficient diet . 
 hence  an abnormality in the efa metabolism in the pilosebaceous unit caused by vit b - complex appears to be the important step in the pathogenesis of phrynoderma . 
 the main drawback of the present study is lack of biochemical evidence of nutritional status ( serum levels of nutrients ) of patients . 
 these investigations were not done because of their non - availability in a resource poor set - up . 
 normal serum levels of nutrients ( vit a  vit b - complex  efa ) have been reported in phrynoderma patients . however  with the available literature and our findings  it can be hypothesized that phrynoderma may be a multifactorial disease involving multiple nutrients  local factors like pressure and friction  and environmental factors manifesting in the setting of increased nutritional demand . 
 further prospective case - control studies investigating the levels of vit b - complex  vit a  vit e  and efa in the blood and skin  and also in relation to the treatment are required to delineate the exact pathogenesis of phrynoderma .","

1) Abstract: Phrynoderma, a type of follicular hyperkeratosis, is often associated with various nutritional deficiencies and can present with discrete, keratotic lesions. In a study of 125 patients, the majority had asymptomatic lesions on bilateral and symmetrical sites, with signs of vitamin A and B-complex deficiencies present in a small percentage. 

2) Research and Discussion: In a cross-sectional study, the clinical features of phrynoderma were examined in 125 patients, with a majority of asymptomatic, bilateral lesions. The disease is believed to be multifactorial, involving nutritional deficiencies, local factors, and increased nutritional demand. These findings suggest the need to address both nutrient deficiencies and external factors when treating phrynoderma. 

3) Results and Conclusion: Of the 125 patients with phrynoderma, 91.2% had asymptomatic lesions and 84.8% had localized lesions on elbows, knees, and other extensor extremities. Signs of vitamin A and B-complex deficiencies were present in small percentages, along with epidermal and follicular hyperkeratosis. Based on these results, phrynoderma can be considered a multifactorial disorder that requires attention to both nutrition and external factors in its treatment."
"dieulafoy lesion is an aberrant submucosal vessel that lies in close contact with the mucous membrane  which may lead to its exposure  causing massive gastrointestinal ( gi ) bleeding.1 it is the cause of approximately 6% of upper gi bleeding.2 it is most commonly found in the proximal stomach and especially within 6 cm of the gastroesophageal junction  predominantly on the lesser curvature . 
 however  it can occur anywhere in the gi tract  such as the small bowel.3 due to difficult access  diagnosis of small bowel bleeding is often delayed ; therefore  a multidisciplinary approach is needed to obtain its proper diagnosis and treatment . 
 we experienced two cases of ileal dieulafoy lesion bleeding that presented with massive hematochezia and instability of vitals . 
 the two cases were diagnosed and treated successfully using single balloon enteroscopy ( sbe ) with hemoclips . 
 we discuss the clinical features as well as useful diagnostic and therapeutic modalities of ileal dieulafoy lesion through a computer - assisted search of the english language literature . 
 a 47-year - old man was admitted to our hospital for hematochezia of 8 hours . 
 he denied previous medical history as well as taking any medication such as non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs . on initial physical examination  
 initial blood hemoglobin level was 10.2 g / dl  but all other values were within normal limits . 
 we tried to perform colonoscopy but failed due to poor bowel preparation and fresh blood . on the second day of admission 
  he developed hypovolemic shock due to massive hematochezia  and blood hemoglobin level dropped to 6.2 g / dl . 
 he underwent abdominal computed tomography ( ct )  which showed contrast media that filled the bowel lumen at the terminal ileum . 
 the contrast media had leaked out of the vessel supplied by a branch of the right ileocolic artery of the superior mesenteric artery  and the bowel lumen around the terminal ileum was filled with contrast media ( fig . 
 1 ) . however  we failed to control the bleeding  because the artery was too small for embolization treatment . 
 he received transfusions of 10 units of packed red blood cells . while he was prepared for emergency surgery  his vital signs became stabilized  so he underwent colonoscopy . 
 we found fresh blood throughout the entire colon and terminal ileum but could not find the bleeding focus . for small bowel evaluation  we performed sbe with a retrograde approach and found the dieulafoy lesion on the distal ileum  approximately 20 cm from the ileocecal valve ( fig . 
 for evaluation of other small bowel lesions  we performed capsule endoscopy but could not find any abnormal lesion except the previously placed hemoclips ( fig . 
 she had obstructive coronary artery disease and took aspirin and an antiplatelet agent . on admission  
 blood hemoglobin level was 8.7 g / dl . on the day of admission  she underwent egd and colonoscopy  but we could not find the bleeding focus . 
 she then underwent abdominal ct  but there was no specific lesion in the gi tract suspicious for bleeding . 
 we recommended enteroscopy for evaluation of the obscure bleeding focus  but she refused because her melena ceased . 
 vital signs were stabilized  and she was discharged home on the ninth admission day . 
 six days after discharge  she revisited our hospital due to recurrent fresh hematochezia . at that time 
  blood pressure dropped to 88/56 mm hg  and pulse was 107 beats / min . 
 as she had underwent egd and colonoscopy  we performed sbe with a retrograde approach . 
 we found a fresh blood clot adherent on the mucosa of proximal ileum and  after saline irrigation  we detected the active bleeding focus at a narrow point of normal - appearing mucosa ( fig . 
 she was discharged home and had no evidence of recurrent gi bleeding at her 2 month follow - up visit .

 dieulafoy lesion can be associated with massive  life - threatening hemorrhage and accounts for between 1% and 2% of cases of major gi bleeding.4 dieulafoy lesion is used to describe the finding of a large submucosal artery  which is otherwise histologically normal  lying in close contact with the mucous membrane . 
 the etiology of this abnormally tortuous submucosal artery is unknown.5 the incidence varies from 0.5% to 14%  depending upon selection criteria.2 as documented above  the diagnosis of dieulafoy lesion is based upon classical histologic features . however  histologic evaluation is usually unavailable in most case  because recently most vascular lesions have been treated by nonsurgical modalities.6 endoscopists rely entirely on endoscopic features to make their diagnosis from a critical review of many published articles . 
 endoscopic criteria for the diagnosis of dieulafoy lesion are : 1 ) active arterial spurting or micropulsatile streaming from a minute ( less than 3 mm ) mucosal defect or through normal - surrounding mucosa ; 2 ) visualization of a protruding vessel with or without active bleeding within a minute mucosal defect or through normal - surrounding mucosa ; or 3 ) a fresh  densely adherent clot with a narrow point of attachment to a minute mucosal defect or to normal - appearing mucosa.7 although endoscopic features could not be proven to be a true dieulafoy lesion by the historical criteria mentioned above  the endoscopic finding remains convincing for dieulafoy lesion . in one study  the authors classified vascular lesions in the small bowel into the following six groups : 1 ) type 1a  punctulate erythema ( < 1 mm )  regardless of oozing ; 2 ) type 1b  patchy erythema ( a few mm )  regardless of oozing ; 3 ) type 2a  punctulate lesions ( < 1 mm ) with pulsatile bleeding ; 4 ) type 2b  pulsatile red protrusion without surrounding venous dilatation ; 5 ) type 3  pulsatile red protrusion with surrounding venous dilatation ; and 6 ) type 4  unclassified lesions . 
 being different in size from one another  types 1a and 1b were considered angioectasia . 
 type 2a and 2b were considered dieulafoy lesion  and type 3 represented an arteriovenous malformation.6 according to that classification  our first case is considered to be type 2b  and the second case is 2a . 
 angioectasia is a venous / capillary lesion and thus is likely to be treated by endoscopic cauterization . 
 however  dieulafoy lesion and an arteriovenous malformation may cause arterial bleeding  which require endoscopic treatment with a clip or with laparotomy for large lesions . 
 the authors concluded that this classification would be useful for selecting the hemostatic procedure.68 small bowel bleeding continues to be difficult to visualize directly on routine endoscopy . 
 therefore  diagnosis of bleeding in the small bowel is often delayed . to localize a source of small bowel bleeding  multidisciplinary approaches such as abdominal ct  angiography  radionuclide scan  and capsule endoscopy is needed . with the development of endoscopy  push enteroscopy is performed to diagnose and treat a bleeding source . 
 push enteroscopy has two types  sbe and double - balloon enteroscopy ( dbe )  and two approaches  anterograde ( per oral ) and retrograde ( per anal ) . in some studies  sbe is as effective as dbe for the appropriate diagnosis and management of obscure gi bleeding cases by identifying a bleeding source and providing a means of treatment in a high percentage of patients.910 however  in some studies  dbe had a higher total enteroscopy rate than sbe accompanied by a higher diagnostic yield.1112 enteroscopy has a low risk of complications . 
 however  acute pancreatitis after enteroscopy is the most frequent complication and has to be taken into consideration in the written informed consent.13 several cases of ileal dieulafoy lesion bleeding have been reported . 
 most of them were treated surgically and diagnosed with histology.14 - 16 however  endoscopic treatment will replace surgery in a significant portion of small bowel dieulafoy lesion cases . 
 since the widespread availability of endoscopic or angiographic treatment  surgery will play a minor role and often be left as the last therapeutic option for rebleeding lesions or after failed nonsurgical treatment.16 in summary  for the appropriate evaluation of small bowel bleeding  an aggressive multidisciplinary approach  such as radiologic intervention  enteroscopy  and surgery  should be performed . with advances in endoscopic techniques  enteroscopy could play a major role in the diagnosis and treatment of ileal dieulafoy lesion bleeding .","

1) Abstract: Ileal dieulafoy lesion is an uncommon cause of gastrointestinal bleeding that can be life-threatening. Advances in enteroscopy have allowed for successful diagnosis and treatment in previously inaccessible cases.

2) Research and Discussion: In two cases of massive ileal dieulafoy lesion bleeding, single balloon enteroscopy was used for successful identification and intervention. This highlights the importance of aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for small bowel bleeding.

3) Results and Conclusion: This report demonstrates the successful use of single balloon enteroscopy in diagnosing and treating ileal dieulafoy lesion bleeding. Early recognition and intervention are crucial in preventing potentially life-threatening hemorrhage. "
"obesity stigma and negative stereotypes of obese people are widespread and damaging to the health  dignity  human rights  and quality of life of obese individuals . 
 standard media and biomedical depictions of obese individuals contribute to this stigmatization by positing that obesity incidence is nearly entirely dependent on individualistic actions . 
 furthermore  obese individuals ' may occupy numerous intersecting social roles and identities based on their gender  class  race  and other social positions . 
 biomedical and media depictions invariably refer to obesity as a crisis or epidemic . obesity 's multifactorial and multilevel etiology is reduced to an  energy balance  model of causation  which inadequately explains weight trajectories . despite the oft - reported inefficacy of weight loss dieting  public health 
 interventions may be unsuccessful due to a narrow focus on weight loss  an overly simplistic notion of how obese individuals live ; experience their bodies ; the contexts they inhabit ; and the opportunities available to them in seeking wellness  happiness  and a full life . 
 furthermore  while health is posited as the ultimate goal  these projects frequently focus on weight and deem fatness or higher weights as necessarily pathological . 
 this is especially important given that the populations often targeted by such campaigns may differ culturally and socioeconomically from dominant groups . 
 these diverse factors may affect their lifeways  priorities  and health conceptualizations in manners which may require in - depth exploration to produce truly beneficial and sensitive programming . 
 qualitative social scientists  such as anthropologists or sociologists  trained in methods such as ethnography  may be uniquely suited to explore the lived experiences of obese individuals . 
 they may aid in developing a public health strategy that is suited to the priorities and lifestyles of all individuals and is implemented in a manner consistent with a salutogenic  positive  and holistic understanding of health promotion . 
 this paper discusses the potential for in - depth  qualitative social science research to concretely contribute to program delivery . even within the expanding fields of critical obesity research  as warin and gunson note 
  the compiling of actual obese people 's experiences and perspectives has been limited . through actual collaboration between disciplines  rather than public health researchers and programmers and qualitative social scientists operating in separate silos 
 importantly  rather than reliance on stereotypes  such an approach would facilitate compassionate and evidence - based policy and programming . 
 understanding how both patients and providers view health - related topics and how these actors must negotiate these views in a care - setting context is critical to planning effective and respectful public health care delivery . 
 biomedical research nearly invariably posits obesity as a health crisis  despite evidence that obese individuals may be metabolically healthy ; overweight people live longer than  normal  weight persons  as do obese individuals in chronic disease populations and fit obese persons compared to unfit  normal weight  persons [ 2  6 ] . 
 weight bias is moderate to high among healthcare professionals and trainees  including those specializing in obesity or nutrition - related practice [ 711 ] . 
 a recent systematic review of physicians ' views on treating adult obesity found that physicians believed it was important to treat obesity . 
 they were confident in their skills respecting obesity treatment  although obesity knowledge was actually limited . 
 physicians believed they were largely unsuccessful in treating obesity but attributed this to patient noncompliance and lack of motivation  which coincides with their general view of overweight and obese individuals as lazy . 
 similar results were attained by foster and colleagues in 2 nationally representative american surveys ( n = 5000 ) . 
 physicians felt treatment for obesity was ineffective ; held negative views of obese patients ' appearance and compliance ; attributed obesity causation to lifestyle factors ; and sought greater compensation in delivering obesity treatment . 
 similar to other studies  physicians in new york state expressed frustration in attempting to treat obesity . 
 this frustration was based on the extent to which obesity - contributing factors were outside their control  low sense of self - efficacy in treating obesity  and a perceived lack of reimbursement . 
 however  they also feel they are unsuccessful in treating obesity  largely as a result of noncompliance and lack of motivation of patients . 
 reimbursement appeared to be less of an issue regarding physicians ' views of childhood obesity . 
 studies have also presented more nuanced views of clinicians ' attitudes relating to obesity treatment . 
 for example  physician 's bmi may mediate physicians ' likelihood of counseling obese patients . among primary care physicians  
 weight loss discussions were more likely to be initiated by physicians who believed clients had a higher bmi than themselves . 
 normal weight physicians were also more likely to feel confident administering said advice  to feel physicians were responsible for serving as normal weight role models and to doubt patients would trust weight - related advice from overweight or obese clinicians . 
 another study conducted in new york city involved a chart review and patient survey  and its results suggest little focus on obesity in practice . 
 it was found that physicians were relatively unlikely to enter an official diagnosis of overweight or obesity on a patient 's chart  to advice weight loss or refer to a dietitian . 
 patients generally wanted to lose weight and receive physician advice and referral to a dietitian . a qualitative study on german physicians ' and patients ' views on obesity management found that doctors were concerned with a potential overemphasis on obesity . 
 both physicians and patients emphasized the need for multidisciplinary approaches to obesity management  the excess burden on primary care centres  and emphasized respectful trusting relationships between practitioners and patients . 
 the need for more services and professional involvement  delivered by physicians or other providers  either separate from or within a primary care setting  was also referred to by both groups . 
 a recent debate in the canadian family physician journal has highlighted that practitioners may be developing a more critical view on the orthodoxy of advocating weight loss for every obese patient . 
 bosomworth presents a review on possible negative mortality  morbidity  and quality - of - life outcomes of weight loss . 
 it is suggested that metabolically healthy obese individuals should strive to remain weight stable  not to gain or lose weight . 
 an accompanying editorial encourages promoting self - acceptance and healthy lifestyles for obese patients  as weight loss is nearly impossible . 
 havrankova presents the argument that weight loss as a public health goal is futile and contends that the focus should be on preventing obesity [ 21  22 ] . 
 garrel posits that obesity prevention is largely outside the practitioner 's purview and argues instead for obesity treatment [ 23  24 ] . 
 based on these guidelines  garrel supports urging weight loss only in obese individuals who have comorbid conditions ; physicians should work with obese individuals without comorbid conditions to prevent weight gain [ 23  24 ] . 
 treatment of obese individuals with comorbid conditions would involve treating these comorbidities  setting realistic weight goals with patients  and warning them of unsafe weight loss methods . 
 it allows for the possibility that some obese patients may be healthy and not benefit from treatment . 
 physicians are more likely to refer to dietitians than to gastric bypass surgeons or to prescribe medication . 
 dietitians agree on their primacy in obesity treatment . in a sample of 514 canadian dietitians  
 about 90% felt obesity contributed to ill - health and a large majority felt obese individuals should be encouraged to lose weight . 
 however  they also emphasized the importance of health measures other than weight in obesity treatment  and the majority advised their clients against weighing themselves . 
 indeed  many dietitians were positively disposed toward a weight - neutral  health - at - every - size ( haes ) approach ; however  there was variation in plans to adopt more structured eating plans and abandoning weight loss as a goal . 
 some also argued that certain ( larger ) sizes exceeded healthy limits . in examining clinician perspectives on obesity  what appears to be essential  therefore  
 is the establishment of trusting and respectful relationships between clinicians and their obese patients in designing interventions for obese persons . 
 these relationships must be sustained in light of obesity 's likely intractability and potential nonpathological nature 
 . a greater understanding of clinicians ' and obese patients ' health perspectives  perceptions  and priorities over the life course is paramount for achieving these aims . 
 better understanding of the experience of visiting healthcare providers as a larger patient may also provide valuable insight into sensitive care delivery and health ( not weight)-centric treatment approaches 
 . a greater awareness of the stigma obese individuals encounter in day - to - day life  as well as in the healthcare system  is of particular importance to improve health and quality of life . 
 examining these issues in depth is essential to rectify a social justice issue that has immense health and quality - of - life implications for a significant population . 
 ethnographers and other applied social science researchers may be especially adept at exploring this issue and learning from obese persons about the oppression they may endure . 
 this discrimination occurs in both interpersonal encounters and in institutional settings such as social situations  places of employment  and health care settings . 
 this discrimination is particularly notable among heavier individuals ( bmi > 35  kg / m )  40% of whom reported experiencing discrimination in the american 1995 - 96 national midlife development survey . 
 women and younger adults were also at considerably higher relative risk of experiencing weight stigma . 
 these findings coincide well with reports of high levels internationally of stigmatizing attitudes toward obese persons . 
 the public emphasizes the presumed causal role of the individual in developing obesity  and this was the single strongest predictor of possessing a stigmatizing attitude . 
 the pervasiveness of obesity stigma in health care settings is of particular importance for obese individuals ' health and public health planning [ 7  8 ] . 
 awareness of these sentiments may make it especially difficult for obese individuals to find adequate medical care . 
 social scientists could explore these issues and seek to deploy an in - depth  exploratory perspective from obese individuals ' own ( emic ) perspective . 
 the depiction of obesity in biomedical  media  and other popular accounts contributes to the manifestation and degree of obesity stigma present among the public . 
 gard and wright identified that obesity research was communicated to the public in a way that erases the inherent uncertainty and imprecision of epidemiological studies and presents obesity as necessarily a health crisis  despite nondefinitive evidence . 
 as this work is generated from within a biomedical institution  it is presumed to be unquestionably objective and lacking in any moralizing  political  or ideological thrust . 
 such a frame allows for the dismissal of alternate views as fallacious  whether they originate from alternate epistemological scholarly arenas  lay perspectives  or embodied experience . 
 it also disqualifies concerns of how this research may affect or be affected by antifat bias . 
 these portrayals may inadvertently silence the source most important to understanding the public health programming needs of obese individuals  that is  obese individuals themselves  by presenting a homogenizing and blaming view of such individuals ' lifestyles and experiences . 
 these views are likely to be reliant on assumptions  rather than data on obese persons ' lived experiences . 
 bringing forth obese individuals ' perspectives and learning from their embodied knowledge through multidisciplinary research may enhance public health programming efforts . 
 media commentators ' particular moral values help to establish which component of life they choose to implicate as causing obesity . often these values are related and presumed to be unique to modern life  such as diminished quality family time or the slothful nature of the current generation of children . 
 similar to these accounts are evolutionary explanations for obesity stressed in media  which may present an inaccurate understanding of the biological or archaeological evidence of humanity 's evolutionary past . 
 regardless of the validity of such claims  these and other arguments that invoke a golden era of nonobesity and health continue to deploy a moralistic frame that denigrates modern lifestyles as decadent  slothful  and glutinous . 
 particularly  adult commentators often direct their ire toward children as embodying the presumed deterioration of societal values and lifestyles . 
 child health prevention programs reliant on this framing may risk stigmatizing  disempowering  and harming children  rather than on trying to understand the children 's own perspectives . 
 these portrayals posit that individuals are responsible for both the cause and cure for obesity . 
 this depiction contributes to stigmatizing attitudes toward obese individuals  who come to be viewed as embodying a remediable social and health burden  borne  in part  by others . 
 it further discounts that obese individuals may be healthy  may choose to emphasize more holistic  less weight - centric conceptualizations of health  or may have lives that preclude investment or engagement in self - care . 
 interestingly  since 2003  lawrence has detected a shift in american media coverage of obesity . 
 personal responsibility framing dominates ; however  increasing focus is being placed on environmental factors that may contribute to obesity  particularly the fast food industry . 
 unfortunately  this emphasis has not significantly affected antifat attitudes [ 28  29 ] . 
 while environmental risks for obesity are acknowledged  individuals are assumed to willingly incur these risks and thus still be largely culpable for their body size and worthy of disapprobation . 
 this discrimination has spread to previously nonstigmatizing nations . rather than castigating obese individuals for their size  qualitative social science researchers may be in a position to rewrite common stereotypical assumptions of obese individuals ' lives by working collaboratively to better understand the health and experiences of an often maligned group and addressing the health concerns most relevant to them . 
 in addition to referring to obesity as an epidemic or crisis [ 2  31 ]  an even more extreme figurative device is employing military metaphors . 
 this discourse effectively constructs obese individuals as targets in a war or even as domestic terrorists . 
 terms like  contagious  are also used when describing obesity in epidemiological studies using methods such as social network analysis [ 33  34 ] . 
 this frame seems to be particularly detrimental to the potentially health - enhancing and stress - reducing benefits of social support networks for individuals . as developing obesity 
 is extremely feared [ 35  36 ]  it may be very isolating for obese individuals to have their friendship portrayed as a risk for developing obesity . 
 it has been suggested that stigma may serve as a motivator for weight loss among obese individuals [ 1  38 ] . 
 however  the evidence provides a far bleaker picture ; stigmatizing obese individuals is an ineffective tactic in reducing obesity rates . rather than stimulating healthful behaviors 
  stigma is more likely to produce poor eating habits and inactivity and thus may actually augment both obesity prevalence and disordered eating [ 1  3942 ] . 
 additionally  the catastrophic rhetoric used to describe the obesity epidemic has been suggested as a potential contributor to rising rates of eating disorders . 
 interventions designed to ameliorate childhood obesity have also been implicated in the development of eating disorders [ 4449 ] . 
 given the adverse psychological outcomes produced from weight discrimination  stigma may also compromise physical and psychological health through stress - induced neuroendocrine dysregulation [ 1  50 ] . 
 muennig and colleagues found that the difference between ideal weight and actual weight had a stronger effect on mentally and physically unhealthy days than bmi in american adults  suggesting that body dissatisfaction may have a potent impact on health  over and above objective fatness . 
 the health effects of stigma - induced stress will likely be exacerbated by healthcare discrimination [ 7  8 ]  consequent inadequate care  and subsequent avoidance of healthcare providers . 
 obesity may increase the risk of poverty  downward social mobility  and subsequent ill - health through prejudice and discrimination affecting education  employment  income  housing  and healthcare opportunities . 
 thus  weight stigma may be far more health - damaging than previously thought and far more damaging than  excess weight  . 
 for example  formerly obese adolescent girls continued to suffer from the lower self - esteem characteristic of chronically obese adolescents . 
 additionally  there is qualitative evidence that weight loss efforts and concomitant lifestyle  dynamic  and emotional changes may result in dissolutions of friendships . 
 this deterioration of social support may be an unacknowledged mechanism through which weight stigma affects health  which may previously have been erroneously attributed to the weight itself . 
 in such a stigmatizing context  individuals may utilize a variety of stigma management techniques . 
 these methods may include attempting to lose weight as both an act of contrition and to minimize the fatness for which obese individuals are oppressed [ 5458 ] . 
 monaghan conducted ethnography on male members of a united kingdom slimming club and explored the effects of stigma on their lives . 
 one method of managing stigma utilized by these individuals  who varied in their acceptance of obesity as a discredited state  involved the accounts they related concerning their weight issues [ 56  58 ] . 
 some accounts entailed offering excuses that mitigated individual responsibility for obesity  such as appeals to a genetic condition or environmental issues . 
 other individuals justified their size through appeals to their enjoyment of food or pride in their powerful size . 
 individuals who rejected the discredited nature of obesity emphasized natural body diversity or deemphasized the importance of weight regarding health [ 56  58 ] . 
 while one account may suit a particular context  a different account may be more useful in different situations [ 56  58 ] . to cope with stigmatizing environments 
 being aware of the everyday effects of stigma on individuals ' lives  lifestyles  and health is an essential factor in planning salutogenic  engaging  beneficial  and inclusive public health strategies . 
 for example  understanding obese persons ' decisions to avoid particularly stigmatizing physical fitness venues may allow public health planners to design an atmosphere conducive to supporting individuals of all sizes to engage in enjoyable  health - conducive movement . 
 the literature thus suggests that obese individuals experience substantial stigmatization and exist in an environment saturated with nonproblematized information concerning the health risks of excess weight . 
 this information is often presented in a manner that assumes control for health resides in the individual  the possibility of health and obesity are mutually exclusive  and that achieving wellness constitutes a moral imperative . to a greater or lesser extent 
  individuals appear to have adopted this discourse and allowed it to influence their perspectives and lifestyles . 
 individuals ' health perceptions may be influenced by pervasive mainstream weight discourse but also be mediated by somatic understandings of wellbeing . 
 as evidence suggests that obese individuals may be healthy  obese individuals may not absorb popular obesity - related messaging  based on their own somatic signaling or knowledge of their lifestyles . 
 individuals may also have differing priorities regarding wellness that supersede weight concerns  such as an emphasis on experiencing pleasure or mitigating income - related food insecurity . 
 regardless of the health risks associated with obesity  a greater understanding of how obese individuals feel concerning their health and quality of life  what obese individuals regard as their priorities concerning health  and what they feel would most benefit their quality of life and wellness is necessary . 
 these views may also alter over time as different weight trajectories are experienced  and this is essential to consider given the chronicity of obesity . in crafting public health messaging  programs  and policies 
 is considering the potentially multifaceted effects of stigma on obese individuals ' lives [ 59  60 ] . 
 this includes incorporating that which is  most at stake for actors in a local social world  within the social dimensions of stigma [ 60  p. 1525 ] . 
 for example  this may involve stigma impeding life chances  financial and life opportunities  and the fulfillment of individual or familial role functions [ 59  60 ] . 
 this view of stigma also considers the manner through which stigma is sociosomatic and how through psychobiological  moral - somatic  and moral - emotional pathways  stigma may have direct physiological consequences . 
 these data on obese people 's perspectives and health will add to the rich work conducted in critical obesity and fat studies  theoretical understandings of the body  and qualitative research done on discursive bodily and health perspectives of individuals ' of all sizes  for example  [ 2  32  3648  5658  6268 ] . 
 recent movements have emerged that are critical of a weight - centric public health model . 
 one such undertaking is the health - at - every - size ( haes ) approach . 
 haes advocates are critical of weight loss dieting 's very low rates of sustained weight loss and potentially negative effects on physical and mental health 
 . such effects can include lowered self - esteem  heightened stress  weight cycling  and bone loss . 
 furthermore  haes advocates are critical of the overestimation of excess weight 's effects on morbidity and mortality ; the discounting of the existence of healthy obese individuals ; and the ethics of promoting weight loss  given its low levels of success and possible harms . 
 instead  the haes movement promotes the benefits of engaging in enjoyable physical activity and body acceptance . 
 haes practitioners advice eating nutritionally according to an intuitive eating model  based on intuitive cues of hunger and satiety . 
 clinical trials of haes lifestyle interventions have demonstrated improvements in psychosocial  clinical  physiological  and behavioral measures  independent of weight loss . 
 critically  participants did not experience negative consequences  including weight gain  and these results compared favorably with diet - focused intervention groups [ 3  4 ] . 
 the inclusion of social scientists into public health strategizing would facilitate the inclusion of true insiders ' ( i.e.  obese individuals ' ) perceptions on the advantages and disadvantages of these novel developments . 
 these scholars  often from outside health fields  have raised critiques concerning dominant obesity discourse . 
 studies critiquing the biological and epidemiological underpinnings of the prevailing view of obesity as a major health concern and the product of individual behavior have been published . 
 a variety of issues have been raised by these scholars and include the use of terms such as epidemic or crisis in referring to obesity ; the moralization of a presumed health issue and resultant ethical and stigmatizing implications of interventions and messaging ; and the dominant obesity discourse 's effects on individuals ' bodily understandings  [ 2  32  3648  5658  6268 ] . 
 findings from these and similar studies would benefit intervention planners in better understanding the daily lives of obese persons  obese individuals ' perspectives on health  and how to plan the most beneficial interventions . 
 anthropology 's traditional focus on the subaltern has become more cognizant and reflective of power relations in research than in past  more colonially complicit  eras of anthropology . 
 a focus today on stigmatized populations  such as obese persons  would draw upon emerging strengths in anthropology  including the utilization of anthropology in social critique and the development of critical ethnography . 
 while in the contemporary social climate obese individuals are often stigmatized  obese individuals and their allies have also marshaled resistance to dominant obesity messaging . 
 monaghan conducted ethnography on the lives of male members of a united kingdom slimming club [ 56  58 ] . 
 this provided invaluable information on the experience and management of stigma in these individuals ' lives . 
 further investigations into the experience of weight stigma for men  women  and children are necessary to grapple with a source of discrimination  which can be life and health - damaging but has attracted limited attention and censure . indeed 
 such forms of stigma may operate largely unconsciously  and participant observation may be a valuable tool in detecting this stigma  its effects  and providing empirical support for effecting change . 
 further ethnography on obese individuals  with a focus on health and with applied aims  would be immeasurably useful to health care providers  public health professionals  and the general public of all sizes . thus  collaboration between ethnographers and health researchers in planning health interventions would serve the interests of both disciplines and more importantly the needs of obese individuals . 
 ethnographers could study individuals ' experiences in health care settings  fitness centers  or in employment and educational settings  in which weight bias has been reported . in documenting the manner 
 in which obese individuals ' live ; the choices they make ; their priorities in wellness and quality of life ; their contributions to society and their potential experiences with others ' biases ; applied social scientists could put a human face on obesity and work toward producing a positive  life - affirming  and inclusive public health focused on reducing stigma and blame and helping all people achieve a high quality - of - life . 
 applied social science can enhance obese individuals ' quality of life by providing a greater understanding and problematization of  taken for granted  assumptions regarding obese individuals ' health  lives  and lifestyles . 
 this epitomizes what rabinow   views as a particularly salient and novel area for anthropological exploration . 
 the problematization of  serious speech acts  and practices  things  and classifications . anthropological experimentation in these areas could move aspects of a culture from being viewed as natural  to contingent  and finally  from a reflexive perspective [ 70  p. 67 ] . 
 the problematization of taken - for - granted social attitudes and processes is particularly relevant in studying weight stigma  which is largely considered unremarkable  or even acceptable  in current sociocultural climes . 
 prevailing attitudes suggest that obese individuals are necessarily unhealthy  lazy  self - indulgent  and lacking in will power . 
 internalization of such accounts may make individuals feel unhealthy  unworthy  immoral  or disempowered based on their body size or innocuous lifestyle choices . 
 emic understandings of obese individuals ' lives  through ethnography or similar in - depth research methods  could lead to a less - stigmatizing  more healthful view of how obese individuals navigate their everyday lives 
 this more in - depth understanding may contribute invaluably to public health approaches in the future . 
 a greater understanding would be available on what constitutes health to obese individuals  what they prioritize in terms of wellbeing  and their experiences in seeking to live well lives . 
 this perspective would help counter potentially traumatic past experiences of dieting or healthcare discrimination ; produce a more patient - centered approach more congruent to obese individuals ' lives and wishes ; and help establish trusting relationships and bonds between obese individuals  health care providers  and public health officials . 
 applied social scientists  particularly those with access to health practitioner and policy - related audiences  may be especially valuable in this research endeavor with respect to disseminating findings and facilitating progress . 
 these individuals may circulate a critique to key stakeholders in health - related fields  who are in a position to effect change . 
 specific opportunities for qualitative researchers could involve participant observation of obese persons ' interactions with the healthcare system to identify what these persons find the most challenging and most promising aspects of their care in these settings . 
 critical ethnography could also be conducted within existing prevention programs to identify successful  sensitive  or problematic components of existing programs . 
 multisited ethnography could allow obese persons to identify sites of stigmatization and places of support for undertaking self - care . 
 needless to say  challenges would arise in attempting a critical ethnography of the lived experience of obese individuals . 
 investment in orthodox obesity understandings are entrenched among biomedical  public health  and lay audiences . seeking to conduct and disseminate such research 
 this may be particularly evident in trying to demonstrate its value to those largely unaware of obesity stigma 's pervasiveness  its effects  or who have internalized negative stereotypes of obese persons . 
 researchers would also have to be reflexive concerning their own biases and truly and accurately reflect the findings of research participants . in order to best stimulate change  these researchers would also have to strive to create positive  open - minded  and collaborative relationships with a variety of biomedical  public health  and lay audiences in order to exchange findings in a manner most conducive to cooperation and reform . 
 otherwise  researchers risk merely circulating critique among those already critical of dominant obesity discourse or incapable of initiating reform to public health interventions and messaging . facilitating 
 the collaboration of partnerships between patient - providers and policy makers would be of great value . 
 this would allow policy makers to learn from patients ' experiences and desires to rewrite public health messaging  programs  and clinical guidelines to better address obese persons needs and priorities in terms of healthcare system allocation ; address systemic and interpersonal discrimination ; and establish weight industry regulations more in keeping with respect for consumers and truth in advertising . 
 these possibilities  along with numerous others  would allow researchers and public - health planners to learn what health priorities are pertinent to a needlessly patholigized and stigmatized population . 
 it may open the doors to previously nonconsidered structural reforms and the provision of holistic  local health needs . 
 these individuals are inundated daily with messages concerning the risk that they embody  solely by virtue of their size . 
 these risks are thought to extend beyond their own health  to the health of others  the sustainability of the health care system  and even society 's future . 
 furthermore  society deems them as culpable for their presumed poor health and for straining the health care system . within this environment  
 exposure to such messaging renders obese individuals as a population worthy of special consideration in planning public health programs to avoid reinforcing demeaning stereotypes . 
 what are lacking  despite this oppressive focus on obesity  are the perspectives of obese individuals themselves concerning their health  goals  wishes  and quality of life . 
 furthermore  limited attempts have been made to bridge communicative gaps between physicians and obese patients and to gain a more thorough view of physicians ' perceptions on obesity . 
 given applied social scientists ' dedication to understanding emic perspectives and expertise in in - depth exploratory methods such as ethnography  they may be particularly suited to aid in this pursuit . 
 the outcome may be beneficial  inclusive  and nonstigmatizing public health programs from which all individuals would greatly benefit ."," show me

1) Abstract: This paper explores the role of applied social scientists, such as anthropologists or sociologists, in understanding the experiences and perspectives of the stigmatized population of obese individuals. It suggests that such research can aid in developing a nonstigmatizing and salutogenic approach to public health interventions.

2) Research and Discussion: Through in-depth studies of the lived experiences and embodied perspectives of obese individuals, applied social scientists can bring a new perspective to understanding this marginalized population. This type of research can help to challenge popular beliefs about the causes of obesity and inform more effective public health interventions.

3) Results and Conclusion: The results of this research could have a powerful impact on the field of public health and lead to the development of a more inclusive and effective approach to addressing obesity. By utilizing the strengths of applied social science to investigate the mundane and problematize commonly held beliefs, a better understanding of the health priorities of all individuals can be achieved.

"celiac disease ( cd ) is a common autoimmune disorder estimated to affect approximately 1% of the us population . 
 many studies have evaluated methods for identifying high - risk populations of patients in need of proactive screening for case identification . as with many chronic diseases  
 quality improvement approaches can be applied to populations of patients with cd to standardize care and track outcomes . effectively identifying and tracking outcomes of these cohorts of patients 
 however  the development of cd patient registries often requires significant resources including practitioners  informatics teams  and administrative support . 
 our center has developed and maintained a patient registry including all newly diagnosed patients since early 2012 . 
 prior studies have evaluated the reliability of international classification of diseases-9 ( icd-9 ) searches to identify patients with cd with only moderate success yielding only 17% of sensitivity . 
 contrast experiments have been done using manually defined keywords to classify high - risk cd cases generating much more accurate results at 73% of sensitivity . 
 few efforts combining different aspects of available information to further improve classification accuracy including the use of data from visits  laboratory tests and pathology reports have been described . 
 pathology reports have been previously used in building natural language processing ( nlp ) systems for automated chart review of patients . here  we define nlp broadly as methods to process textual data . 
 one study found pathology reports to be insufficient for detecting breast cancer when using nlp approach compared with manual approaches while others found the use of nlp for analyzing pathology reports to be effective on detection of colon cancer and manifestation of prostatectomy details . 
 currently  a lack of research exists on investigating the usefulness of pathology reports on automated cd detection . based on a subset of patients prescreened using icd-9 code 579.0 
  we evaluated the effectiveness of using natural language features from pathology reports to improve the identification of cd patients . 
 this paper was among the first to adopt a machine learning approach to further increase the accuracy of cd patient identification based on a combination of pathological and clinical metrics . 
 in contrast to prior research  we conducted contrast experiments using both natural language features and clinical features under different machine learning configurations for celiac identification . 
 usa ) clinical system on patients who visited our hospital from 2012 to 2015 and had icd-9 code of 579.0 assigned indicating concern for cd . 
 our subsequent analysis was  therefore  based on patients with concerns rather than general patient population . 
 a laboratory test result was marked with a nominal value of either high ( 20 eu / ml ) or normal ( < 20 eu / ml ) . 
 an upper endoscopy ( egd ) may also be performed then resulted in a text - based pathology report  which could be used for nlp analysis . 
 the registry that we developed are all confirmed diagnosis of cd based on confirmation with both abnormal laboratory / serology testing and biopsy confirmation after detailed chart review . for each of our patients in the registry  cd 
 most confirmed cd patients ( confirmed by our experts for having cd ) only had one pathology report while false - positive cd patients ( confirmed by our experts for not having cd ) had either one or zero pathology report . 
 twenty - nine patients who had two or more pathology reports were excluded from our experiment as they presented a challenge to our analysis if inconsistent information about cd diagnoses existed at different periods of time . in patients with multiple ttg laboratories  
 the most elevated laboratory result obtained within the past 6 months of the egd was chosen to represent the laboratory status of that cd patient . 
 variables used for celiac classification are listed in table 1 . for the report category  
 the total number of pathology reports was used with one indicating patients having egd done and 0 otherwise ( v1 ) . both user - define phrases ( high - risk phrases  or v2 ) and 
 automatically extracted phrases ( n - gram phrases generated from our machine learning program  or v3 ) were chosen to evaluate the effectiveness of utilizing pathology reports . 
 for the laboratory category  both the laboratory results ( v4 ) and total number of labs done were used ( v5 ) . for the icd-9 category  
 the total number of cd icd-9 codes assigned ( v6 ) was used for classification . 
 variables for celiac disease classification to evaluate the effectiveness of using different combinations of variables and feature selection methods  we further developed two additional set of variables based on the aforementioned six sets of variables above ( v1v6 ) . combining all first six categories of variables created the variable set 7 ( v7 ) . automatically selecting features out of v6 using

 the kappa score measured the level of agreement between the user and the classifier with 1 being complete agreement and 0 being complete disagreement . 
 our data extraction resulted in identification of 1498 unique patients with icd-9 codes suggesting possible cd . 
 we found 363 confirmed cases ( positive celiac cases [ table 3 ] ) matching the previously establish celiac registry and 1135 false positive cases ( negative celiac cases [ table 3 ] ) . demographic data are shown in table 3 . 
 chi - square test found statistically significant associations between age  gender  race  and celiac status . 
 classification variables such as those about visit  laboratory and pathology report counts and laboratory results were all found to be significant for differentiating cd patients . as this study mainly focused on using clinical variables for celiac classification we did not include any demographic variables in building classifiers [ table 3 ] . 
 patient characteristics and their association with celiac disease table 4 listed the results summarizing the best classification model out of each variable configuration . 
 models were ranked based on auc score from the highest to the lowest . among all twelve classification models  we experimented with the libsvm 
 was found to be the top performer in five experiments ( experiments 3  4  5  6  8)  followed by logistic model in two experiments ( experiments 1  7 ) and nave bayes in one experiment ( experiment 2 ) . 
 the best performing model was the logistic model using all available features filtered by an automatic feature selection process . 
 it achieved auc of 0.94  kappa of 0.78  and f1 of 0.92 [ table 4 ] . 
 statistics of the best classification models for each variable configuration among experiments using single category of variables ( experiment 2 and 48 )  nave bayes model based on automatically selected n - gram features generated the best results : auc of 0.92  kappa of 0.73  and f1 of 0.90  which was also the overall second best performing model . here  we also conducted feature selection on executing the nave bayes model as we aimed to find the best possible performance of using text features . despite the slightly lower performance  
 the nave bayes model was much faster than other models in terms of model building and model evaluation time . in our case 
  it only took nave bayes a few seconds to build and evaluate the model in 10-fold cross - validation while it took a few minutes for libsvm and logistic model to finish in the case of using all 4000 features . using only high - risk phrases  number of laboratories and number of icd-9 ( experiment 6  7 
  8) resulted in the lowest model accuracy . using laboratory resulted in higher accuracy than the previous three . 
 it was also intriguing that using the number of pathology reports alone only slightly underperformed using report text features alone . 
 however  additional features resulted in higher accuracy given the results based on a combination of different features . 
 table 5 listed some of the automatically selected n - gram phrases in contrast to user - provided high - risk phrases . 
 it was found that automatically created n - gram features not only covered the majority of user - provided high - risk phrases but also had the potential of being more accurate and specific in finding relevant information . 
 for example  automatically generated n - grams such as celiac and abdominal pain were directly relevant features to cd but were not initially on our clinicians list . 
 comparison of user - defined high - risk phrases and automated key phrases some of the provided high - risk features were not included in our automatically selected feature list such as the phrase of marsh lesion ( converted to lower case for processing ) . 
 we found this may be due to the extreme low frequency of the usage of such phrases in our pathology reports ( only 1 out of all 363 confirmed cases had this exact phrase ) . in table 5  the italicized phrases highlighted some of the overlaps between the two lists : user - provided and automatically extracted . 
 the automatically extracted list only represented a subset of most relevant n - gram features [ table 5 ] . 
 our machine learning approach could quickly and effectively choose the most relevant variables from various clinical sources for automated cd classification . 
 the level of accuracy we achieved was higher compared with previous studies on the same topic . 
 n - gram features performed well in our cd detection experiment which agreed with and further improved the results from previous studies using text features . 
 in contrast to previous studies  our automated feature generation and selection approaches were more efficient in finding relevant classification features in a short period of time and more effective than user - provided high - risk phrases . 
 this result showed the automated list was more effective in providing a comprehensive list of relevant keywords than manual methods . 
 the number of laboratories done was as effective as the actual lab results reported in our case for cd classification ( auc of 0.71 vs. 0.83 ) . 
 this could be because an increased number of labs done or the fact that the laboratory was ordered may suggest a higher likelihood of abnormal laboratory result . 
 our experiments also agreed with previous studies on the fact that icd-9 code alone produced very poor results ( kappa of 0.28  f1 of 0.75 and auc of 0.63 ) . 
 therefore  we suggested researchers only use icd-9 code as a prescreening tool for subsetting patients as in this study . 
 in addition  our results added further evidence to previous studies that nave bayes model generated the most accurate results even if only pathology report features were used ( kappa of 0.73  f1 of 0.90  and auc of 0.92 ) . 
 this further indicates that pathology report  as an important pierce of synoptic reporting of celiac status  contains invaluable information for celiac classification . 
 in addition  by combining both clinical and text features altogether  classification accuracy and kappa score could be further improved ( kappa of 0.78  f1 of 0.92  and auc of 0.94 ) . 
 this suggests the complementary effect of using both structured data and unstructured data for celiac classification . 
 finally  feature selection was found to be a crucial step in celiac detection for further improving the efficiency and accuracy of classification . 
 feature selection dramatically removed redundant and noninformative terms ( from about 4000 to 60 ) . 
 although new to the task of cd classification  feature selection methods have been found widely used in other disease classification studies including alzheimer 's disease and asthma . in our case  some variables ( i.e.  number of pathology reports and lab results ) could individually predict celiac at a reasonably high accuracy . however  this result may be problem dependent 
 . other studies implementing the same metrics may or may not result in similar performance . 
 even that  we still observed performance gain by adding nlp features with both accuracy and agreement increased by a reasonable amount . 
 the automated tool we developed could speed up the process of refining the subset population initially identified based on icd-9 code 579.0 . 
 this refining process can automatically confirm the patient as either positive or negative cd case based on the knowledge of the patient obtained from the laboratories and pathology notes . 
 the classification accuracy was over 90% of correctness ( f1 ) in our case while it greatly eliminated the need of often time - consuming process of manual review . 
 first  since the cd classification task was performed on a subset of patients prescreened by icd-9 code rather than on the general patient population  the performance of final classification results may depend on the accuracy of initial icd-9 assignment . for example  if actual cd patients were not assigned an icd-9 code 579.0 initially  they will not have the chance of being further identified by our machine learning system . 
 it is  therefore  important to make sure the initial icd-9 code assignment will include as many high - risk cases as possible . 
 second  although feature selection method was found to be critical in yielding high performance  we have not conducted systematic experiments with all possible feature selection methods provided in the weka machine learning system . given our experience  it was likely that some methods may further improve accuracy while others may even lower the accuracy . finally  for most machine learning algorithms we experimented  only the default configuration was used for classification . 
 it was likely different configurations of parameter setting may lead to very different results of accuracy . 
 therefore  researchers are encouraged to experiment with different classifier settings to achieve the best possible results for their tasks .

 in this paper  we compared results from 96 machine - learning experiments for cd identification based on 12 classification model variations and eight feature set variations . 
 the logistic model that used a combination of clinical and pathology report features generated the best results : kappa of 0.78  f1 of 0.92  and auc of 0.94 . 
 our results were in agreement with previous studies on the insufficiency of using icd-9 codes alone and the merits of using pathology report features for cd identification . 
 this study provides new evidence on adopting feature selection techniques to further improve classification efficiency and accuracy based on a subpopulation of prescreened patients using icd-9 code . 
 this study demonstrated a viable computational approach to automatically reviewing and confirming prescreened cd patients based on icd-9 code at the state of the art accuracy much improved from previous research on the same topic .

1) Abstract: This study aimed to develop automated classification algorithms using natural language processing to identify patients with celiac disease (CD) in electronic health records (EHRs). Results showed that combining pathology reports and laboratory results with the established ICD-9 code for CD produced the most accurate results, improving upon the use of ICD-9 codes alone.

2) Research and Discussion: Previous studies have shown that relying solely on ICD-9 codes is insufficient for accurately identifying CD patients. This study introduced a new approach using pathology reports and laboratory results to refine the subset population preselected using ICD-9 codes. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in improving the efficiency and reliability of CD patient identification.

3) Results and Conclusion: A total of 1498 patient records were used in this study, and the automated classification system produced a kappa of 0.78, F1 of 0.92, and AUC of 0.94. These results were significantly better than using ICD-9 codes alone, which only produced a kappa of 0.28, F1 of 0.75, and AUC of 0.63. This study highlights the importance of utilizing comprehensive data, such as pathology reports and laboratory results, in identifying CD patients in EHRs."
"the possible presence of infection in cervical smear tests is usually reported by the cytologists based on cytological criteria 
 . therefore  non - specific cervicitis or inflammatory changes in a smear report are common . 
 these findings are usually unclear for clinical approaches and there is not an appropriate guideline for management of such patients . 
 it is not known if these women should be recalled for cultures and treatment or inflammatory change should be considered as minor . 
 changes in balance of normal vaginal flora can cause an overgrowth of pathogens that lead to discharge . 
 although it is a common complain among sexually active women  there are still gaps in our knowledge about it . bacterial vaginosis ( bv )  vaginal candidiasis ( vc ) and trichomoniasis are the three infections most commonly associated with vaginal discharge ( 1 ) . 
 a number of studies have indicated the association of bv with postoperative complications after gynecologic surgery as well as pregnancy complications ( 25 ) . 
 trichomonas vaginalis ( tv ) is also another common cause of vaginal discharge  but some studies have not found its association with pregnancy complications ( 3 ) or some other indicated that tv during pregnancy was a predisposing factor for preterm delivery and delivering low - birth weight infants ( 6 ) . the pap smear test for detection of bv has showed a sensitivity of 88.2%  a specificity of 98.6%  and a positive predictive value ( ppv ) of 96.8% ( 7 ) . the sensitivity  specificity  and ppv of pap test for tv diagnosis has been reported 98%  96%  and 88%  respectively ( 8) . also  some recent studies have demonstrated the co - infection of vaginal pathogenic organisms in pap tests ( 2  9  10 ) . 
 this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of pathogenic vaginal microorganisms and the presence of inflammation in pap smear among an iranian women sample and to evaluate the possible co - infection of these organisms . 
 this cross - sectional study was carried out on pap smear samples of women referred to gynecological clinic of taleghani hospital in tehran  iran  between october 2008 and march 2009 . 
 exclusion criteria were pregnancy  smoking  use of oral contraception and/or corticosteroids  regular use of vaginal douche  and women with chronic systemic diseases or systemic immunosuppression . 
 prior to data collection  the objectives of the study were explained in community meetings . 
 all women received their laboratory results in written form  and results were explained during a consultation . 
 the study protocol was also approved by the institutional review boards of department of gynecology and obstetrics . 
 data were obtained in privacy using an information form applied by one investigator  followed by gynecological examination and specimen collection all done by one gynecologist . 
 cervical smear samples  based on the conventional method  were prepared with a spatula and fixed on glass slides and were stained with the papanicolaou technique . 
 tv was defined as the presence of trophozoites in pap smears ; vc was diagnosed if fungal hyphae or budding yeasts were present in pap smears . 
 the presence of inflammation in the smears was divided into mild  moderate  and severe categories . 
 mild inflammation was defined as less than 30 inflammatory cells / high - power field ; moderate inflammation was defined as 30 to 100 inflammatory cells / high - power field ; and severe inflammation was defined as more than 100 inflammatory cells / high - power field . 
 the frequency of pathogenic microorganism included bv  tv  and vc were determined in specimens . 
 statistical significance was analyzed using statistical package for social sciences ( spss software version 17 ) . 
 the comparison between data was performed with the pearson 's chi square or fisher 's exact test . 
 mild inflammation was noted in 136 ( 26.1% )  moderate in 155 ( 29.4% ) and severe in 117 ( 22.2% ) of them ( table 1 ) . 
  the frequency of pathogenic vaginal microorganisms and inflammation among pap smear samples among all samples  bv ( the presence of clue cells ) was the most common pathogenic microorganism which was seen in 91 samples ( 17.2% )  followed by vc ( n = 56 ; 10.6% ) . 
 tv ( n = 2 ; 0.4% ) was shown to have a low prevalence among our patients ( table 1 ) . 
 the overall prevalence of pathogenic microorganisms was greater among reproductive age participants  meanwhile the prevalence of bv as well as vc was significantly different ( p = 0.042 and p = 0.006  respectively ) between non- and post- menopausal women . 
 inflammation was detected in 76% ( n = 402 ) of pap smears  in which 80.1% ( n = 322 ) were reported among reproductive age women . however  the severity of inflammation was not significantly different between non- and post- menopausal women . 
 overall  the presence of inflammation was significantly associated with vc ( p = 0.002 )  but its severity was not correlated to the infection . 
 although  there was no significant relation between the presence of inflammation and bv  the severity of inflammation in specimen was significantly increased in association with bv ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 in our study  the prevalence of bv among pap smear specimens of women living in tehran was 17% which is similar to azargoon 's study ( 16% ) on a population in semnan ( another city in center of iran ) ( 3 )  but it had a higher rate in hamadan ( a western city of iran ) and has been reported 28.5% ( 11 ) . in comparison with other asian countries  in india  
 but it was 38% in an african study in botswana on 703 pregnant women ( 13 ) . 
 some predisposing factors for bv include having sexual relationship with more than one partner  early onset of sexual activity  orogenital sexual contacts  coitus during menstruation  use of iud  and smoking ( 2  14 ) . 
 differences in sexual behavior and risk factors in different societies can justify the differences in bv prevalence of mentioned studies . 
 reproductive age women indicated that the prevalence of bv in muslim women was lower than non - muslims . 
 although the prevalence of tv in pap samples of our study was much less than several studies  similar reports demonstrated by depuydt et al in flanders detected by real - time pcr ( 0.37% ) ( 15 ) . however  this rate was 18% in the study in hamedan ( 11 )  8.5% among indian women ( 16 )  and 19% in the african study ( 13 ) . 
 a probable reason for these variations could be differences in pap sampling quality and cytologists skill . 
 several studies show an increased vaginal ph ( 5 ) in both bv and tv infection ( 3  5  17 ) . 
 demirezen et al in turkey on 600 pap tests detected tv in 6% of women and bv in 44% of tv cases . 
 they also found a significant relationship between tv and bv infection  which might be due to this hypothesis that tv by phagocytosis the vaginal lactobacilli increases the vaginal ph and generates an anaerobic environment  providing an appropriate condition for the growth of anaerobic microorganisms ( 18  19 ) . 
 also  it was confirmed by heller 's study on 400 pap samples which concluded that bv diagnosis should be considered at the presence of tv in pap smears ( 2 ) . in our study  we found no significant association between bv and tv in conventional pap smear sampling  which might be because of low prevalence of tv in our samples . 
 the effect of habits and behaviors on vaginal flora among different population can be evaluated in further assessments . in our study  only the presence of candida in pap smear samples was associated with the report of inflammation . therefore  reporting inflammation in pap smear test might be considered for candidiasis evaluation and treatment . 
 several studies investigated the association between infection and existence of inflammation in cervical smears ( 2023 ) . 
 some of them found that inflammation on pap smear had a relatively low predictive value for the presence of infection ( 21 ) . 
 they stated that the inflammation was not exactly a consequence of infection and other causes might be responsible for this appearance ( 20 ) . 
 in contrast  others indicated a significant association between inflammatory smear and reproductive tract infections ( 22  24 ) . 
 as burke et al ( 22 ) in their study on 256 women found an evidence of inflammation in 9.7% of smears and genital tract infection in 29.2% of their participants overall . 
 they found infection in 48% of women having inflammatory changes on smear test vs. 27.3% of women whose smear tests showed no evidence of inflammation . 
 they discovered that the prevalence of infection with chlamydia trachomatis  candida  bacteroides and gardnerella vaginalis was higher in the inflammatory smear group . 
 they concluded that women with an inflammatory smear were more likely to mask the infection than women whose smear shows no evidence of inflammation ( 22 ) . 
 prevalence of bv infection ( 17% ) in this study was similar to most other studies  which was not true for tv ( < 1% ) . 
 the use of other diagnostic methods may be probably more valuable than conventional pap smear for evaluation of tv among iranian women and it needs further investigations . as the report of inflammation in our samples was very high  
 use the newer pap smear techniques such as thinprep ( liquid base preparation ) in the further studies is recommended . based on our results  
 inflammation reported in the pap smears demands the evaluation for vc and its proper treatment .","

Abstract: The study investigated the frequency of inflammation and pathogenic vaginal microorganisms in cervical smears of an Iranian population sample. Inflammation and infections were more common in reproductive age women and were associated with vaginitis. 

Research and Discussion: The cross-sectional study analyzed 528 conventional Papanicolaou cervical smears for the presence and severity of inflammation, as well as the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and vaginal candidiasis (VC). Results showed a significant association between inflammation and VC, suggesting a higher incidence of vaginal infections in women of reproductive age. 

Results and Conclusion: The prevalence of BV and VC was 17% and 11% respectively, with a lower prevalence of TV at 0.4%. There was a higher incidence of microorganisms in reproductive age women compared to menopausal women. These findings suggest that inflammation in pap smears may indicate a potential infection and proper treatment should be considered for patients."
"brucellosis is a highly contagious zoonosis caused by bacteria of the genus brucella and is listed in class b animal epidemics by the world organization for animal health ( oie ) . 
 the genus has six classic species : b. abortus  b. melitensis  b. suis  b. canis  b. ovis and b. neotomae . 
 recently  the marine species b. ceti  b. pinnipedialis  b. microti and b. inopinata were included in the genus ( foster et al . 
 the incidence of human brucellosis is estimated by the oie at 500000 new cases per year worldwide . 
 however  official statistics is widely acknowledged to be underestimated and  in a considerable number of cases  the origin of the infection is not identified . 
 the majority of human cases worldwide is attributed to b. melitensis ( pappas et al .  2005 ) . 
 in general  b. melitensis and b. suis are more virulent in humans than b. abortus or b. canis ( who  2006 ) . other species can cause infection in humans  but only rarely ( diaz aparicio  2013 ) . 
 the disease is more prevalent in western parts of asia  india  middle eastern  southern european and latin american countries . 
 the transmission of brucella infection and its prevalence in a region depend on several factors  such as dietary habits  methods of processing milk and milk products  social customs  husbandry practices  climatic conditions  socioeconomic status and environmental hygiene ( mantur and amarnath  2008 ) . 
 as the infectious dose is very low  infections are an occupational risk for farmers  veterinarians  abattoir workers ( schneider et al .  2013 )  laboratory personnel and others who work with animals and consume their products ( pepin et al .  1997 ) . 
 human brucellosis is transmitted by inhalation  animal contact and the consumption of dairy products and undercooked meat products . 
 the consumption of traditional dishes  such as raw liver  can cause human infection ( malik  1997 ) . 
 however  it has been estimated that even 10 - 100 microorganisms are sufficient to cause the disease in humans ( pappas et al .  2006 ) . 
 thus  contaminated meat and meat products could represent a source of infection  especially if they come from animals slaughtered during the acute phase of the disease ( fao / who  1986 ) and if they are consumed raw or undercooked . 
 the handling and preparation of infected meat and offal may give rise to the contamination of other foodstuffs and kitchen utensils ( who / cds / epr/2006.7 ; who  2006 ) . tests carried out in the us on the carcasses of bovine and swine that were slaughtered because infected revealed that 1.2% of the bovine carcasses and 3.5% of the swine carcasses were contaminated by brucella spp . 
 ( sadler  1960 ) . in a similar study conducted in india on 100 carcasses of goats  two of the 700 neck muscle samples analysed tested positive for brucella melitensis ( randhawa and karla  1970 ) . 
 other studies have shown that the offal of slaughtered ruminants constitutes a risk for transmission of the infection ( fatma and mahdey  2010 ; sekulovski  2008 ) . 
 in orderto evaluate the prevalence of contamination of meats and to assess the risk of infection for consumers and professionally exposed workers  an investigation on 307 carcasses of bovines  sheep and goats that were slaughtered because they had resulted positive on serological testing for brucella spp . was performed . 
 the study was carried out within the framework of the national programmes for the eradication and monitoring of animal diseases and the prevention of zoonoses in italy  approved by decisions 2011/807/ue and 2012/761/ue of the european commission ( 20112012 ) . 
 the study lasted 12 months and was carried out in 10 abattoirs in southern italy  where brucellosis infection is still widespread on cattle  sheep and goat farms . 
 after slaughter  swab samples were taken from 307 carcasses : 40 cattle  60 sheep and 207 goats . 
 these animals came from 24 different farms and were slaughtered because they had proved positive on serological tests for brucella spp . in previous studies ( randhawa and karla  1970 ; fatma and mahdey  2010 ) brucella spp . contamination of the carcasses of slaughtered animals had been evaluated by means of microbiological tests carried out on samples of muscle or organ tissue . in the present study  
 swab samples were taken in accordance with the procedure indicated by the decision of the european commission ( 2001 ) : duplicate samples were taken by means of swabs  both dry and moistened in a sterile aqueous solution  which were wiped over the external and internal surfaces of the carcasses immediately after slaughter and before storage in refrigerators . 
 a total of 608 swab samples were taken ; no transport medium was deemed necessary  as the samples were promptly consigned to the laboratory  where they underwent polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) analysis for brucella spp . in accordance with the following procedure . for dna extraction  a commercially available kit ( qiaamp dna mini kit ; qiagen  valencia  ca 
 amplification was carried out by means of a nested pcr technique  based on a published protocol ( romero et al .  1995 ; 
 the second step utilised a pair of oligonucleotides that are internal to those used in the first step and produce a smaller fragment ; they prove functional only if the result of the first pcr is specific . 
 ( 5-tcgagcgcccgcaagggt - gagcgg-3 ) and r2 ( 5-aaccatagtgtctc - cactaacc-3 ) allowing an amplification product of 905 bp . in the second step of pcr  the primer pairs r0 
 ( 5-tagctagttg - gtggggtaaaggc-3 ) and r1 ( 5-caggcttgcgcccattgtcc-3 ) were used allowing an amplification product of 144 bp . to prepare the reaction mixture for the first pcr  12.5 l of a commercially available pcr master mix ( pcr master mix ; promega corp . 
  madison  wi  usa ) was used at a 1x concentration for each sample . 
 the reaction mixture contains 50 units / ml of taq polymerase  400 mm of datp  dgtp  dctp  dttp and 3 mm of mgcl2 . to the reaction mixture  
 0.5 l of each primer  f4 and r2 at a concentration of 0.2 m  and 6.5 l of h2o were added  with a final reaction volume of 25 l . as a positive control in pcr  
 the negative control was made up only of master mix and water . to prepare the reaction mixture for the second pcr  
 the thermal profile of the first pcr involved an initial denaturation at 95c for 4 followed by 35 cycles of denaturation ( at 94c for 1 )  annealing ( at 54c for 1 ) and extension ( at 72c for 1 ) and a final extension at 72c for 7. the thermal profile of the second pcr was the same as the first one except for the cycle number that consisted of 30 cycles in the second pcr . in accordance with italian law and with the aim of eradicating brucellosis in cattle  sheep and goats  
 the carcasses of infected animals may be freely marketed if the outcome of post - slaughter examination is favourable  while all the internal organs and the udders must be destroyed . 
 parts of these organs were therefore removed and subjected to culture tests for the bacteriological identification and typing of brucella spp . by means of the technique described in the manual of the office international des epizooties  ch . 
 this involves : streaking on brucella agar medium added with a selective supplement and horse serum ; incubation at 37c in an atmosphere enriched with 5 - 10% co2 ; and observation for up to 10 days . 
 subsequent species typing of the isolated strains was carried out at the national reference centre for brucellosis in teramo ( italy ) by means of the pcr - restriction fragment length polymorphism technique  in accordance with the procedure prescribed in vol . 
 the biomolecular tests revealed the presence of brucella spp . in 25/307 carcasses ( 8% ) : 1 bovine carcass ( 2.5% ) of a 9-year - old cow ; 9 carcasses of sheep ( 15% ) aged between 18 months and 5 years  all from the same farm ; and 15 carcasses of goats ( 7.2% ) aged between 12 months and 6 years and coming from 5 different farms ( figure 1 ) . 
 the 25 carcasses found to be contaminated with brucella spp . belonged to 25 animals slaughtered in 6 different slaughterhouses . 
 the bacteriological tests carried out on the organs of all 307 animals examined allowed isolating brucella spp . in 136/307 cases  i.e. 44% 
 the typing analysis allows detecting type 3 brucella abortus in the cattle organs  and type 3 brucella melitensis in the sheep and goats organs . 
 the organs  specifically the lymph nodes  from all the carcasses that had tested positive on pcr on swabs  also proved positive on bacteriological testing for type 3 brucella abortus ( the bovine carcass ) and for type 3 brucella melitensis ( the sheep and goat carcasses ) . 
 the results obtained show that the carcasses ( i.e.  the meat ) of animals slaughtered due to brucella spp . 
 this situation is the same as that seen in the case of other pathogens  like salmonella spp .  for which specific laboratory tests are prescribed and measures have to be taken . in the present study  
 the percentage of meats that proved to be contaminated was far higher than in the studies quoted above ( sandler  1960 ; randhawa and karla  1970 ) . contamination by brucella spp . 
 was detected in a higher percentage of sheep carcasses than cattle or goat carcasses  while the bacteriological tests conducted on the organs detected the highest percentage of contamination among goats . 
 the only brucella serotypes isolated from the organs were type 3 brucella abortus in cattle and type 3 brucella melitensis in sheep and goats . 
 these are the only serotypes that have been isolated in recent years in the geographical area considered ( casalinuovo et al .  2011 ; de massis et al .  2014 ) 
 thus  the environments and facilities of slaughterhouses may also be severely contaminated  thereby constituting a risk of contagion for staff involved in butchery and meat handling  and a risk of contamination of the carcasses of other animals that are not infected by brucellosis . indeed  the positivity of the carcasses involved 6/10 slaughterhouses . 
 our samples were taken at the end of the butchery process  when the carcasses were ready for storage in refrigerators or delivery to retail outlets . 
 this means that each contaminated carcass could in turn contaminate equipment and utensils and other meats or foodstuffs . consequently  even in domestic kitchens  contamination could further involve other equipment  utensils and food products . indeed  as brucella spp 
 . survives well at the temperatures reached by refrigerators or freezers  other refrigerated or frozen foods may become contaminated . 
 pcr testing of swab samples taken from the carcasses of animals that had tested positive for brucella proved to be useful . 
 this practice could be applied systematically  since this noninvasive sampling technique does not damage commercial meat cuts  is economically advantageous  and requires far less time ( 24 - 48 h ) than detection by means of culture media . 
 carcasses that resulted positive for pcr might be sequestered and potentially submitted to different confirmation tests . 
 annex i  section iv  chapter ix  f  of regulation ( ce ) n. 854/2004 ( european commission  2004 ) deals with what should be done with meat from infected animals  and lays down preventive measures to be taken with regard to the specific risks of brucellosis . 
 indeed  the regulation requires that animals proving positive or uncertain for brucellosis have to be slaughtered separately  and that precautions have to be taken to avoid the risk of contaminating other carcasses  the butchery process and the abattoir staff . the udders  genital organs and blood of such animals are classified as unfit for human consumption  while their meat can be freely marketed . only if postmortem examination reveals lesions attributable to acute infection by brucella spp . 
 otherwise  the meat of these animals  just like the meat of healthy animals  is allowed to enter the food chain . 
 these measures are justified by the need to avoid the destruction of large amounts of meat  which is a valuable food source . 
 nevertheless  the results of the present study show that the carcasses  and consequently the meat  of animals positive for brucellosis may be contaminated by brucella spp . 
 this means that consumers may be exposed to the risk of infection  so they should be sufficiently informed with regard to the origin of the meat at the time of purchase .","

Abstract:
This study evaluated the contamination of meat from animals infected with brucellosis using PCR and traditional bacteriological tests. Results showed that 8% of carcasses tested positive for Brucella spp. Through PCR, and 44% through culture methods. These findings highlight the need for meat to be tested before being marketed to prevent potential transmission to personnel and consumers.

Research and Discussion:
This study focused on detecting Brucella spp. contamination in meat from cattle, sheep, and goats slaughtered due to previous infection. PCR proved to be a more efficient and practical method compared to traditional bacteriological tests. Results showed that Brucella spp. was present in 8% of carcasses through PCR and 44% through bacteriological tests. This poses a risk of transmission to personnel and consumers if not properly monitored.

Results and Conclusion:
The study found that a significant percentage of meat from animals slaughtered due to brucellosis was contaminated with Brucella spp. PCR proved to be a more efficient and practical method for detecting contamination compared to traditional bacteriological tests. This highlights the need for testing meat before being distributed to prevent potential transmission. Further research is needed to fully understand the extent of contamination and potential risks to consumers."
"behet 's disease ( bd ) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulceration and uveitis1 )  the other clinical manifestations include skin lesions  arthritis  thrombosis  neurologic symptoms and intestinal ulceration . 
 polychondritis is known as a rare complication of bd and no case of bd combined with polychondritis had been reported on until firestein et al 
 . reported on five patients with both bd and relapsing polychondritis ( rp ) in 19852 ) . 
 we recently experienced a case of a 40-year - old male patient with both bd and polychondritis  and we report herein on this unusual case along with a review of the literature . 
 a 40-year - old man was referred to our hospital for further evaluation of his fever  oral ulcers and skin rashes that had lasted for 10 days . 
 he had previously suffered from intermittent oral ulceration and uveitis that had been treated with oral prednisolone and intraocular injections of triamcinolone at another hospital 1 year prior to this admission . on the physical examination  
 his blood pressure was 130/80 mmhg  the pulse rate was 80 per minute and the body temperature was 38.4. he had conjunctival injections in both eyes and several aphthous ulcers on the tongue ( figure 1a ) and buccal mucosa . 
 a small round ulcer with tenderness was found on the penile root ( figure 1b ) . 
 several round erythematous skin lesions were present on the chest and thigh ( figure 2a ) . 
 his left knee joint was swollen ( figure 2b ) and tender  and needle aspiration revealed turbid inflammatory synovial fluid . 
 the laboratory findings were as follows : hemoglobin 14.8 g / dl  white blood cell count 10400/l  platelet count 291000/l  erythrocyte sedimentation rate 104 mm / hr and c - reactive protein 205 mg / l ( normal range  0~3.4 mg / l ) . 
 the renal and liver function tests were normal and the tests for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody were negative . 
 the urinalysis was normal and no microorganisms were grown on both the blood and urine cultures . 
 his chest radiography showed no abnormal findings and mild splenomegaly was observed on abdominal sonography . 
 skin biopsy was performed and the histologic examination showed perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrations  extravasation of the red blood cells and fibrinoid necrosis of the blood vessel walls ; all of these findings were compatible with cutaneous vasculitis combined with bd ( figure 3 ) . on the 5th day of admission  both ear auricles became swollen  red and tender ( figure 4 ) . 
 he remembered having a similar auricular inflammation 2 years ago that had improved after taking non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs . after he was administered with colchicine 1.2 mg / day and prednisolone 30 mg / day  his clinical symptoms improved and he was discharged on the tenth day of admission . 
 polychondritis is an inflammation of the various catilagenous structures such as the auricle  nose and trachea  and it has also been known to involve the eye and the joints . 
 when polychondritis is relapsing  it is called relapsing polychondritis ( rp)8 ) . in rp  
 various cutaneous manifestations are also seen  including palpable purura  erythema nodosum  panniculitis  livedo reticularis and urticaria . 
 there have been case reports on polychondritis combined with other rheumatologic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle )  rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) and systemic vasculitis9 - 11 ) . 
 however  there have been no reports of polychondritis combined with bd until firestein et al . 
 first reported on five patients who had the features characteristic of both bd and rp  and those authors termed this as mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage ( magic ) syndrome2 ) . 
 polychondritis is still known as a rare complication of bd and only five more cases of bd combined with polychondritis have been reported on since firestein 's report3 - 7 ) . in our patient  
 bd was diagnosed based upon the recurrent oral and genital ulcers  the skin vasculitis  the arthritis and the past history of uveitis . 
 the chondritis developed at the bilateral auricles  eye and the joints during the acute exacerbation period of bd  and this resolved with the improvement of the symptoms of bd . 
 this suggests that the development of polychondritis may have been associated with bd in our case . as for treatment for the combined cases of bd and rp  colchicine  steroid and dapsone 
 skin involvement in bd includes various lesions such as erythema nodosum  pustules  papules  pseudofolliculitis  acneiform folliculits  sweet 's syndrome  or pyoderma gangrenosum12 ) . 
 the histopathology of the papulopustular lesions usually shows vasculopathy that is characterized by the perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells  and this infiltrate is mainly composed of lymphocytes . 
 the erythema nodosum - like lesion is known to be characterized by extravascular neutrophilic infiltration and panniculitis  and this can be followed by lymphocyte infiltration during the evolution of the skin lesions14 ) . in our case  the main histopathylogic finding of the skin lesions was perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration and fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls  which are the characteristic findings of vasculopathy . although cases of bd combined with polychondritis have rarely been reported  bd and polychondritis do not seem to be separate entities . 
 compared the frequency of the various clinical features in bd and rp ( table 1 )  and they showed that some of the manifestations that are considered unique for one disease could be found in the other disease2 ) . 
 these similarities between the clinical manifestations of bd and rp imply that there seems to be something in common for the pathogenesis of bd and polychondritis . 
 the pathogenesis of both bd and rp are associated with autoimmunity . in patients with rp  
 the antibodies to collagen type ii  ix and xi are elevated in the sera15  16 ) and the frequency of human leukocyte antigen ( hla)-dr4 is increased17 ) . 
 additionally  rp has been associated with other autoimmune diseases such as ra and sle9  10 ) . in patients with bd  
 autoantibodies such as antiendothelial cell antibody and antibody to -tropomyosin have been found18 - 20 ) and it has been postulated that cross - reactivity and molecular mimicry between the peptides from the streptococcal proteins or the viral heat shock proteins ( hsps )  which are homologues of human hsps  and the mucosal antigens result in the selection of autoreactive t cells21 ) . 
 have proposed that autoimmunity to components of the cartilage other than type ii collagen  such as proteoglycans or elastic tissue  could be the common mechanism of bd and rp2 ) . 
 in particular  elastic tissue is ubiquitous in the human mucosa that is mainly involved in bd  and in the cartilage too  which is the major target of rp . 
 however  because of the rarity of the combined cases  there have not yet been any investigations about the common pathogenesis of the two diseases  and so additional research is clearly needed . 
 although there have been only a few reports about polychondritis combined with bd  we think this combination of diseases might have been overlooked so far and closer scrutiny would reveal more cases ."," , thanks

1) Abstract: Polychondritis is a rare inflammatory disorder that primarily affects cartilaginous structures and can be associated with various rheumatologic diseases. Our report describes a case of polychondritis in a 40-year-old Korean man with Behet's disease, presenting as auricular chondritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis.
2) Research and Discussion: Polychondritis is often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic vasculitis, but its connection to Behet's disease is rare. To date, only ten cases have been reported worldwide. This highlights the need for further research and understanding of the underlying mechanisms and potential treatment options for this unique combination of diseases.
3) Results and Conclusion: Our case report adds to the limited literature on the association between Behet's disease and polychondritis. It also highlights the importance of considering polychondritis as a potential complication in patients with Behet's disease, particularly when presenting with symptoms of auricular chondritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis. Further studies are needed to establish a better understanding of this rare association and improve treatment options for affected individuals."

 the location of center of resistance has been studied over the years with numerous model systems  these studies include  analytical models  direct measurement in vivo  photo elastic technique  strain gauge technique  laser reflection technique  and holographic method  etc . 
 although these model systems have provided some insight into the displacement characteristics of the tooth to the applied forces  these studies have obvious limitations such as direct measurement in vivo have a distinct disadvantage of being invasive . 
 furthermore  it is difficult to apply controlled force variables on human subjects because of anatomic constraints . 
 the major limitation in studies that used physical models was that synthetic substances were used to simulate the periodontal ligament . 
 many of those materials did not have physical properties exactly duplicating that of the periodontal ligament . in the analytical techniques 
  the root morphology has been approximated to parabolid  conical or wedge shape leading to different results . to overcome 
 the essence of this method is that a predetermined force is idealized into an assemblage of separated finite regions or elements . 
 these are then considered to be interconnected at specific points called nodes on their common boundaries.[5 . 
 the results obtained in this study is in accordance with the study of matsui et al .","


Abstract:
This study aimed to evaluate the center of resistance of maxillary incisors during simultaneous intrusion and retraction using finite element analysis. The center of resistance was found to be located apically and posteriorly in the mid-sagittal plane. This study provides valuable insight into orthodontic forces and dental tissue interactions.

Research and Discussion:
The study utilized preprocessing and postprocessing techniques to create a geometric model and determine the center of resistance. The results showed the location of the center of resistance for the maxillary four incisors, providing useful information for orthodontic treatment. Finite element analysis proved to be a reliable method for this study.

Results and Conclusion:
The center of resistance for maxillary incisors was determined to be approximately 6mm apical and 4mm posterior to a line perpendicular to the occlusal plane. This study can aid in the precise location of the center of resistance during orthodontic treatment. Overall, finite element analysis proved to be a useful tool in understanding orthodontic forces and dental tissue interactions. "

 as a first step to elucidate the antiatherosclerotic effects of exendin-4  we first investigated the expression of glp-1 receptor in cells associated with atherosclerogenesis . similar to lung and pancreatic -cells ( 24 )  mice peritoneal macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells abundantly expressed glp-1 receptor protein  and the expression level was higher than in freshly isolated endothelial cells . 
 similar to the expression level in macrophages  glp-1 receptor was abundantly expressed in thp-1 cells  which are derived from human monocytes  and freshly isolated human monocytes . 
 in contrast to the freshly isolated endothelial cells  abundant expression of glp-1 receptor was detected in huvecs ( fig . 
 in addition  immunohistochemical staining showed glp-1 receptor expression in cells that expressed mac-2  a marker of macrophages located in the atherosclerotic lesions of the aortic valve of apoe mice ( fig . 
 these results may suggest that glp-1 can directly act on monocytes or macrophages and affect the progression of atherosclerosis .

 after the 24-day treatment  both doses of exendin-4 improved glucose tolerance without affecting insulin secretion ( fig . 
 the results of the insulin tolerance test were similar in the two groups ( fig . 
 treatment with high - dose exendin-4  but not the low dose  slightly increased total cholesterol and hdl cholesterol compared with control group ( table 1 ) . the density of monocytes that adhered to the endothelial cells of the thoracic aorta was markedly suppressed in both the low- and high - dose treatment groups  compared with control ( fig .

 treatment with high - dose exendin-4 modestly reduced body weight gain and glucose tolerance and decreased serum total cholesterol level without affecting ldl cholesterol level ( fig . 
 on the other hand  treatment with low - dose exendin-4 only modestly reduced glucose level at 30 min after glucose injection without affecting other parameters investigated ( fig . 
 the density of monocytes that adhered to endothelial cells of the thoracic aorta was significantly lower in the low- and high - dose groups than the control group ( fig . 
 quantification of mrna expression in the thoracic aorta showed that exendin-4 treatment significantly downregulated intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( icam-1 ) and tended to downregulate vcam-1 ( fig . 
 the oil red o  positive area at the aortic valve level was significantly reduced in the high - dose group compared with the control group ( fig .

 b : aortas harvested from each group of mice after 28-day treatment were used for isolation of total rna . 
 the mrna expression levels of icam-1 and vcam-1 were determined by quantitative rt - pcr . 
 relative gene expression is displayed as the level of expression in the test mice relative to that in the control group ( set at 1.0  n = 57 ) . 
 c : representative histologic sections of the aortic sinuses stained with oil red o after 28-day treatment . 
 the mean area of oil red o  positive lesions was determined ( n = 20 ) . 
 ( a high - quality digital representation of this figure is available in the online issue . ) the data obtained from apoe mice and c57bl/6 mice suggested that exendin-4 could have beneficial effects against atherosclerosis without affecting the metabolic parameters and that it could potentially prevent the progression of atherosclerosis by its direct action on the cells involved in atherosclerogenesis . 
 the abundant expression of glp-1 receptor in monocytes / macrophages and the inhibitory effects of exendin-4 on monocyte adhesion on endothelial cells encouraged us to investigate the effects of exendin-4 on the inflammatory response . 
 indeed  incubation with 1 g / ml of lps for 1 h induced 10-fold increases in the expression levels of tnf- and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( mcp-1 )  a representative cytokine and a chemokine in isolated macrophages  respectively ( data not shown ) . 
 thus  we investigated the effects of various concentrations of exendin-4 ( 0.033 nmol / l ) in counteracting this response . 
 exendin-4 at all concentrations significantly suppressed lps - induced increases in the expression levels of tnf- and mcp-1 in macrophages ( fig . 
 glp-1 receptor is well - known gs - protein  coupled receptor  thus the activation of glp-1 receptor results in increased camp concentration due to activation of adenylate cyclase ( 25 ) . to explore the mechanism of exendin-4induced suppression of tnf- and mcp-1 expression in macrophages  we preincubated peritoneal macrophages with mdl-12330a  a specific adenylyl cyclase inhibitor  or forskolin  an adenylyl cyclase activator . 
 the addition of mdl-12330a completely suppressed the inhibitory effect of exendin-4 on the expression levels of tnf- and mcp-1 ( fig . 
 on the other hand  forskolin significantly suppressed lps - induced tnf- and mcp-1 expression in macrophages  and the levels of suppression by forskolin were similar to those of exendin-4 ( fig . 
 these results suggest that the inhibitory effects of exendin-4 on the expression of tnf- and mcp-1 are largely dependent on the activation of adenylate cyclase . 
 next  we investigated the downstream pathway of camp using pki14 - 22  a specific pka inhibitor . 
 similar to mdl-12330a  the inhibitory effect of exendin-4 was significantly reversed by pki14 - 22 ( fig . 
 5d )  suggesting the involvement of pka in the anti - inflammatory effect of exendin-4 . 
 exendin-4 reduced the inflammatory response through camp signaling pathway in macrophages  and reduced the expression of cd11b in human monocytes . a : peritoneal macrophages isolated from 8-week - old c57bl/6 mice 
 were incubated with various concentrations of exendin-4 ( 0.033 nmol / l ) for 1 h followed by treatment with lps ( 1 g / ml ) for 1 h. then  macrophages were used for isolation of total rna . 
 the mrna expression levels of tnf- and mcp-1 were determined by quantitative rt - pcr . 
 relative gene expression is displayed as the level of expression in peritoneal macrophages without the addition of exendin-4 set at 1.0 ( n = 45 ) . 
 b : peritoneal macrophages were preincubated with 5 mol / l mdl-12330a for 30 min before the addition of 0.3 nmol / l exendin-4 and then incubated with lps ( 1 g / ml ) for 1 h. then  macrophages were used for isolation of total rna ( n = 46 ) . 
 / l exendin-4 or 10 mol / l forskolin for 1 h followed by lps ( 1 g / ml ) for 1 h. then  macrophages were used for isolation of total rna ( n = 45 ) . 
 mol / l pki14 - 22 for 30 min before the addition of 0.3 nmol / l exendin-4 and then incubated with lps ( 1 g / ml ) for 1 h. then  macrophages were used for isolation of total rna ( n = 45 ) . 
 mol / l mdl-12330a for 30 min before the addition of 0.3 nmol / l exendin-4 and then incubated with lps ( 1 g / ml ) for 1 h. then  macrophages were used for isolation of nuclear protein extracts . 
 the nuclear level of nf-b p65 was determined by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) ( n = 34 ) . 
 f : human monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers were incubated without or with various concentrations of exendin-4 ( 0.033 
 nmol / l ) for 24 h. then  the surface expression of cd11b was assessed by flow cytometry . 
 although nf-b is a major regulator of the expression of tnf- and mcp-1  vasoactive intestinal peptide and pituitary adenylate cyclase  activating polypeptide are known to inhibit nf-b  dependent gene activation by activation of pka in cultured monocytic cell line thp-1 ( 26 ) . 
 thus  we investigated the effect of exendin-4 on lps - induced nuclear translocation of nf-b p65 in macrophages . without any stimulation  
 nuclear nf-b p65 was not detected in peritoneal macrophages  however  stimulation with lps robustly induced nuclear translocation of nf-b p65 ( data not shown ) . 
 such translocation was markedly suppressed by exendin-4  and this inhibitory effect was completely abolished by mdl-12330a ( fig . 
 these results indicate that exendin-4 inhibits nuclear translocation of nf-b p65 by activating camp  in parallel with the expression of tnf- and mcp-1 . finally  we investigated the effect of exendin-4 on human monocytes . 
 thus  we investigated the effects of exendin-4 on their counterreceptors  cd11b  in isolated human peripheral monocytes . 
 exposure to 0.3 and 3 nmol / l  but not 0.03 nmol / l  exendin-4 for 24 h significantly reduced the surface expression of cd11b  as assessed by flow cytometry ( fig . 
 these results suggest that activation of the glp-1 receptor has the antiatherogenic effects on human circulating monocytes . 
 as a first step to elucidate the antiatherosclerotic effects of exendin-4  we first investigated the expression of glp-1 receptor in cells associated with atherosclerogenesis . similar to lung and pancreatic -cells ( 24 )  mice peritoneal macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells abundantly expressed glp-1 receptor protein  and the expression level was higher than in freshly isolated endothelial cells . 
 similar to the expression level in macrophages  glp-1 receptor was abundantly expressed in thp-1 cells  which are derived from human monocytes  and freshly isolated human monocytes . 
 in contrast to the freshly isolated endothelial cells  abundant expression of glp-1 receptor was detected in huvecs ( fig . 
 in addition  immunohistochemical staining showed glp-1 receptor expression in cells that expressed mac-2  a marker of macrophages located in the atherosclerotic lesions of the aortic valve of apoe mice ( fig . 
 these results may suggest that glp-1 can directly act on monocytes or macrophages and affect the progression of atherosclerosis .

 to investigate the effect of glp-1 receptor activation on atherosclerosis  c57bl/6 mice received continuous infusion of 300 pmol  kg  day ( low dose ) or 24 nmol  kg  day ( high dose ) exendin-4 for 28 days . during the treatment period  neither dose affected body weight ( fig . 2a ) . 
 after the 24-day treatment  both doses of exendin-4 improved glucose tolerance without affecting insulin secretion ( fig . 
 the results of the insulin tolerance test were similar in the two groups ( fig . 
 treatment with high - dose exendin-4  but not the low dose  slightly increased total cholesterol and hdl cholesterol compared with control group ( table 1 ) . 
 the density of monocytes that adhered to the endothelial cells of the thoracic aorta was markedly suppressed in both the low- and high - dose treatment groups  compared with control ( fig .

 to explore the role of glp-1 receptor activation on the progression of atherosclerosis  we treated apoe mice with low- or high - dose exendin-4 . 
 treatment with high - dose exendin-4 modestly reduced body weight gain and glucose tolerance and decreased serum total cholesterol level without affecting ldl cholesterol level ( fig .

 the density of monocytes that adhered to endothelial cells of the thoracic aorta was significantly lower in the low- and high - dose groups than the control group ( fig . 
 quantification of mrna expression in the thoracic aorta showed that exendin-4 treatment significantly downregulated intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( icam-1 ) and tended to downregulate vcam-1 ( fig .

 ( a high - quality digital representation of this figure is available in the online issue . ) 
 the data obtained from apoe mice and c57bl/6 mice suggested that exendin-4 could have beneficial effects against atherosclerosis without affecting the metabolic parameters and that it could potentially prevent the progression of atherosclerosis by its direct action on the cells involved in atherosclerogenesis . 
 the abundant expression of glp-1 receptor in monocytes / macrophages and the inhibitory effects of exendin-4 on monocyte adhesion on endothelial cells encouraged us to investigate the effects of exendin-4 on the inflammatory response . 
 indeed  incubation with 1 g / ml of lps for 1 h induced 10-fold increases in the expression levels of tnf- and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( mcp-1 )  a representative cytokine and a chemokine in isolated macrophages  respectively ( data not shown ) . 
 thus  we investigated the effects of various concentrations of exendin-4 ( 0.033 nmol / l ) in counteracting this response . 
 exendin-4 at all concentrations significantly suppressed lps - induced increases in the expression levels of tnf- and mcp-1 in macrophages ( fig . 
 glp-1 receptor is well - known gs - protein  coupled receptor  thus the activation of glp-1 receptor results in increased camp concentration due to activation of adenylate cyclase ( 25 ) . to explore the mechanism of exendin-4induced suppression of tnf- and mcp-1 expression in macrophages  we preincubated peritoneal macrophages with mdl-12330a  a specific adenylyl cyclase inhibitor  or forskolin  an adenylyl cyclase activator . 
 the addition of mdl-12330a completely suppressed the inhibitory effect of exendin-4 on the expression levels of tnf- and mcp-1 ( fig . 
 on the other hand  forskolin significantly suppressed lps - induced tnf- and mcp-1 expression in macrophages  and the levels of suppression by forskolin were similar to those of exendin-4 ( fig . 
 these results suggest that the inhibitory effects of exendin-4 on the expression of tnf- and mcp-1 are largely dependent on the activation of adenylate cyclase . 
 next  we investigated the downstream pathway of camp using pki14 - 22  a specific pka inhibitor . 
 similar to mdl-12330a  the inhibitory effect of exendin-4 was significantly reversed by pki14 - 22 ( fig . 
 5d )  suggesting the involvement of pka in the anti - inflammatory effect of exendin-4 . 
 exendin-4 reduced the inflammatory response through camp signaling pathway in macrophages  and reduced the expression of cd11b in human monocytes . a : peritoneal macrophages isolated from 8-week - old c57bl/6 mice 
 were incubated with various concentrations of exendin-4 ( 0.033 nmol / l ) for 1 h followed by treatment with lps ( 1 g / ml ) for 1 h. then  macrophages were used for isolation of total rna . 
 the mrna expression levels of tnf- and mcp-1 were determined by quantitative rt - pcr . 
 relative gene expression is displayed as the level of expression in peritoneal macrophages without the addition of exendin-4 set at 1.0 ( n = 45 ) . 
 b : peritoneal macrophages were preincubated with 5 mol / l mdl-12330a for 30 min before the addition of 0.3 nmol / l exendin-4 and then incubated with lps ( 1 g / ml ) for 1 h. then  macrophages were used for isolation of total rna ( n = 46 ) . 
 c : peritoneal macrophages were incubated with 0.3 nmol / l exendin-4 or 10 mol / l forskolin for 1 h followed by lps ( 1 g / ml ) for 1 h. then  macrophages were used for isolation of total rna ( n = 45 ) . 
 mol / l pki14 - 22 for 30 min before the addition of 0.3 nmol / l exendin-4 and then incubated with lps ( 1 g / ml ) for 1 h. then  macrophages were used for isolation of total rna ( n = 45 ) . 
 e : peritoneal macrophages were preincubated with 5 mol / l mdl-12330a for 30 min before the addition of 0.3 nmol / l exendin-4 and then incubated with lps ( 1 g / ml ) for 1 h. then  macrophages were used for isolation of nuclear protein extracts . 
 the nuclear level of nf-b p65 was determined by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) ( n = 34 ) . 
 f : human monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers were incubated without or with various concentrations of exendin-4 ( 0.033 nmol / l ) for 24 h. then  the surface expression of cd11b was assessed by flow cytometry . 
 although nf-b is a major regulator of the expression of tnf- and mcp-1  vasoactive intestinal peptide and pituitary adenylate cyclase  activating polypeptide are known to inhibit nf-b  dependent gene activation by activation of pka in cultured monocytic cell line thp-1 ( 26 ) . 
 thus  we investigated the effect of exendin-4 on lps - induced nuclear translocation of nf-b p65 in macrophages . without any stimulation  
 nuclear nf-b p65 was not detected in peritoneal macrophages  however  stimulation with lps robustly induced nuclear translocation of nf-b p65 ( data not shown ) . 
 such translocation was markedly suppressed by exendin-4  and this inhibitory effect was completely abolished by mdl-12330a ( fig . 
 these results indicate that exendin-4 inhibits nuclear translocation of nf-b p65 by activating camp  in parallel with the expression of tnf- and mcp-1 . finally  we investigated the effect of exendin-4 on human monocytes . 
 thus  we investigated the effects of exendin-4 on their counterreceptors  cd11b  in isolated human peripheral monocytes . 
 exposure to 0.3 and 3 nmol / l  but not 0.03 nmol / l  exendin-4 for 24 h significantly reduced the surface expression of cd11b  as assessed by flow cytometry ( fig . 
 these results suggest that activation of the glp-1 receptor has the antiatherogenic effects on human circulating monocytes . 
 in the present study  we provide evidence that exendin-4  a glp-1 receptor agonist  prevents the progression of atherosclerosis in apoe mice without major effects on metabolic parameters . 
 our data suggest that exendin-4 markedly reduced the accumulation of monocytes / macrophages in the vascular wall at least in part by suppressing the inflammatory response in macrophages through the activation of the camp / pka pathway . 
 the results showed that the exendin-4 decreased monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells in two nondiabetic mice  c57bl6 and apoe mice . in both mouse strains  
 exendin-4 reduced glucose level during ipgtt  however  because the two strains are nondiabetic  the effect of exendin-4 on glucose level should play only a minor effect on its antiatherosclerogenetic properties . in this study  we confirmed the expression of glp-1 receptor in endothelial cells  smooth muscle cells  macrophages  and monocytes . 
 because these cells play critical roles in the progression of atherosclerosis  glp-1 receptor activation in these cells may be involved in atherosclerogenesis . indeed  several groups reported the beneficial effects of glp-1 receptor activation on endothelial cells ( 1013 ) . on the other hand  we confirmed in the present study the direct anti - inflammatory effect of glp-1 on monocytes / macrophages . 
 indeed  treatment with exendin-4 at concentrations observed during treatment of humans ( 2728 ) reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators tnf- and mcp-1 in activated macrophages . tnf- and mcp-1 are among the important cytokines and chemokines whose atherogenic effect has been established . both tnf- and 
 furthermore  forced expression of tnf- and mcp-1 in leukocytes promotes advanced atherosclerotic lesions ( 2931 ) . thus  in addition to the effect of glp-1 on endothelial cells  its effect on monocytes / macrophages may also have a major impact on the attenuation of atherosclerosis . 
 it was reported previously that the main effects of glp-1 are mediated through the activation of adenylate cyclase and the production of camp ( 25 ) . using adenylate cyclase inhibitor and activator 
  we also demonstrated in this study that stimulation of camp by exendin-4 is critical for the attenuated production of proinflammatory mediators from macrophages . 
 this result is consistent with previous studies in which increased intracellular levels of camp inhibited tnf- production and its transcription in macrophage ( 3234 ) . 
 these data suggest that exendin-4 regulates inflammatory response of macrophages via the camp / pka pathway  which inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production as reported recently ( 3536 ) . 
 our results showed that pka activation and inhibition of nf-b p65 translocation mediate overexpression of inflammatory cytokines by increased camp level elicited by glp-1 receptor activation . 
 the adhesion of circulating monocytes to the intimal endothelial cells is thought to be one of the earliest events in the complex pathologic process of atherosclerogenesis ( 1415 ) . 
 this can be mediated by the interaction of specific adhesion molecules on vascular endothelial cells with their integrin counterreceptors on monocytes . 
 activation of monocytes by cytokines  chemokines  hypercholesterolemia  and hyperglycemia leads to increased expression of this integrin  and increased monocyte expression of cd11b correlates with adhesion of these cells to the endothelium in patients with hypercholesterolemia ( 37 ) . 
 our results showed a potential suppressive effect of exendin-4 on the surface expression of cd11b on human monocytes . on the other hand 
  we demonstrated that exendin-4 decreased the expression of icam-1  which interacts with cd11b on monocytes in apoe mice . 
 these effects may contribute at least in part to the reduced monocyte adhesion to the endothelium in vivo . 
 however  additional experiments are required to clarify the mechanism of exendin-4induced inhibition of cd11b expression . in conclusion  our data suggest that glp-1 receptor activation significantly reduced the accumulation of monocytes / macrophages in the vascular wall and eventually inhibited atherosclerogenesis by regulating inflammation in macrophages via the camp / pka pathway and the integrin - related gene expression on monocytes . 
 these unique effects of glp-1 receptor activation may help design new therapies for cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes .","

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to determine the effects of exogenous administration of GLP-1 or GLP-1 receptor agonists on monocyte/macrophage accumulation on the vascular wall, a crucial step in atherosclerogenesis. The results showed that treatment with exendin-4 significantly reduced monocyte adhesion in mouse aortas and suppressed atherosclerogenesis, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for GLP-1 in cardiovascular disease.

Research and Discussion:
Exendin-4 treatment inhibited the inflammatory response in mouse macrophages and human monocytes, as seen by decreased expression of pro-inflammatory markers and reduced nuclear translocation of NF-kB. These effects were reversed by inhibiting cAMP or blocking PKA, suggesting a role for the cAMP/PKA pathway in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of exendin-4. The results also showed a reduction in CD11b expression, indicating a potential role for GLP-1 in regulating monocyte recruitment to the vascular wall.

Results and Conclusion:
Exendin-4 treatment reduced monocyte/macrophage accumulation on the vascular wall and attenuated atherosclerotic lesion formation in mice. This suggests that GLP-1 receptor agonists may have a protective role in cardiovascular disease by inhibiting monocyte adhesion and reducing inflammation. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms behind these effects and their potential therapeutic implications."
"disability prevalence increases with advanced age  and disability in the elderly population is a major public health problem . 
 this is especially crucial for chinese : there are 88 million persons aged 65 and above in china alone  and the number is projected to increase to 341 million in 2050 ; importantly  disability prevalence in chinese elderly population has been increasing [ 35 ] in contrast to a declining trend in the developed countries [ 6  7 ] . 
 there is a big gap between the scale of the problem and the quantity and quality of available information . 
 the first population - based report from china was published 16 years ago  and countable number of publications [ 35  812 ] exist in the literature .   in this study  with large population - based data from shanghai ( the biggest city in china ) and singapore ( a city country in southeast asia  with majority of the residents being descendents of immigrants from south china )  we aimed to examine the independent contributions of physical and cognitive health to disability in chinese older adults and explore the potential influences of environment . 
 participants of the present study were identified from two big population - based studies : the shanghai survey of alzheimer 's disease and dementia ( ssadd ) and the singapore longitudinal ageing study ( slas ) . 
 the ssadd was conducted in 1987 based on a probability sample of 5055 community - dwelling chinese older adults from jing'an district of shanghai city . 
 the slas was conducted among a total population sample of 2808 older adults from south east region of singapore . 
 baseline assessments of the slas were completed from september 2003 to december 2005 .   details of the ssadd [ 8  13 ] and 
  we selected 4639 participants from the ssadd sample and 2397 participants from the slas cohort . 
 all participants had complete data on demographic information  physical health  and cognitive function and obtained a mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) total score of at least 21 points . 
 face - to - face interviews were conducted by psychiatrists / psychiatric nurses ( in shanghai ) or trained research nurses ( in singapore )  and data were collected for a wide range of variables .   for the present analysis  we extracted the following variables from the databases : age  sex  functional status  chronic diseases  self - rated health status  and mmse total score . 
 functional status was assessed by the participant 's level of dependency in performing 8 activities of daily living ( adl ) : eating  grooming  dressing  transferring  walking  toileting  bathing  and climbing stairs . 
 the participants were asked  do you have or not have any of the following illnesses or conditions at the present time ? "" in the slas  a list of 14 medical conditions was covered in the interview . 
 the participants were asked  do you have a history of this medical problem ? 
 medical conditions that were not included in the list were recorded under  any other problems .  we selected ten chronic diseases on which data were available from both samples : hypertension  diabetes  heart diseases ( in singapore : defined as any of heart attack  heart failure  or atrial fibrillation )  stroke ( in shanghai : effects of stroke )  kidney disorder ( in singapore : kidney failure )  chronic obstructive lung disease ( in shanghai : emphysema / bronchitis )  asthma  arthritis ( in shanghai : arthritis or rheumatism )  mental illness  and cancer ( in singapore  identified from  any other problems  ) . in statistical analysis  
 the number of chronic diseases was used as an objective measure of physical health .   in singapore  
 self - rated health status was assessed using a single question :  in general  would you say your health is : excellent  very good  good  fair  or poor ?  in shanghai  the same question was asked but there were four choices : excellent  good  fair  poor . 
 excellent  and  very good  together and created a new variable  self - rated health status  : 1 = excellent or very good  2 = good  3 = fair  and 4 = poor . 
 this was used as a continuous variable in multivariate analyses ( score ranged from 1 to 4  with higher value representing poorer health status ) . 
 the test has been validated in shanghai   and singapore  respectively . summed scores of mmse range from 0 to 30  higher values denoting better cognitive functioning . 
 chi - square test ( for dichotomous variables ) or independent sample t test ( for continuous variables ) was used to compare the difference regarding various characteristics between the two study samples . 
 multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between health factors and disability  and the influence from environment .   in analysis based on the combined sample  age  sex  number of chronic diseases  self - rated health status  mmse total score  and environment ( singapore versus shanghai ) were included in the regression model . 
 the same set of variables ( except environment ) was used in the stratified analysis . 
 the prevalence of disability was much higher in shanghai sample ( 5.0% ) than that in the singapore sample ( 1.8% ) . 
 however  the shanghai participants were also older  had more chronic diseases  had poorer self - rated health status  and obtained lower mmse total score as compared to their singapore counterparts ( table 1 ) . 
 a scrutiny of the eight adl items revealed that the difference was only significant for bathing ( 3.5% versus 0.4% ) and climbing stairs ( 3.1% versus 1.2% ) . in multiple logistic model based on the combined sample  number of chronic diseases  self - rated health status  mmse total score  and environment 
 the odds ratio was 1.35 ( 95% ci 1.221.50 ) for number of chronic diseases  2.85 ( 95% ci 2.363.43 ) for self - rated health status ( continuous )  0.89 ( 95% ci 0.850.94 ) for mmse total score  and 0.68 ( 95% ci 0.480.96 ) for environment ( singapore versus shanghai )  respectively . 
 results from stratified analysis showed that the strength of associations between health variables and disability differed between the two samples ( table 3 ) . 
 for example  in the shanghai   sample  one point increase on the 4-point self - rated health status scale was associated with 3.13 times ( 95% ci 2.553.85 ) higher odds of having disability while the odds ratio was only 1.73 ( 95% ci 1.072.81 ) in the singapore sample . for mmse total score  
 the corresponding odds ratio was 0.91 ( 95% ci 0.860.96 ) in the shanghai sample and 0.83 ( 95% ci 0.730.94 ) in the singapore sample . 
 based on data from two population - based studies  we found that the number of chronic diseases  self - rated health status  cognitive function  and unmeasured environment factors represented by study sample were significantly associated with functional disability among chinese older adults . 
 the contributions of physical health [ 8  18 ] and cognitive function [ 19  20 ] to functional disability have been documented and were well replicated in our analysis .   with large population - based data  we firstly quantified the strength of differential contributions of each of self - reported physical health  self - rated health status  and cognitive function to disability in chinese elderly population . 
 the findings are relevant and important for policymakers  medical practitioners  and academics . 
 participants in the singapore sample were 32% less likely to have disability compared with participants in the shanghai sample . 
 participants from both studies were chinese older adults living in big city  and a number of important covariates were adjusted in multiple regression models . 
 it is less likely that the observed difference was caused by unmeasured factors at individual level . 
 however  a careful examination of the two most difficult adl tasks ( bathing and climbing stairs ) provided us with plausible explanations .   in 1987  most families in shanghai had no bathroom and shower  and bathing was considered as a complicated task . 
 in contrast  the majority of slas participants lived in public houses that have standard bathroom and shower and easy - to - climb stairs . 
 our study provided fresh evidence on the role of environmental factors in disablement process [ 2123 ] . 
 as pointed out by verbrugge and jette :  disability is not a personal characteristic  but is instead a gap between personal capability and environmental demand  disability can be diminished swiftly and markedly if the physical or mental demands of a given task are reduced  . 
 our findings suggest that environment not only affects the prevalence of disability  but also modifies the strength of   associations between disability and health variables . 
 strengths of our study include concurrent measuring of various health factors and simultaneous inclusion of those factors in multivariate model . 
 however  no causal relationship could be drawn given cross - sectional nature of the study design . 
 in conclusion  physical health and cognitive function were significantly associated with disability among chinese older adults living in asian metropolises . 
  
 all the authors contributed substantially to the design  analysis and interpretation of the data and participated in drafting or revising the paper .","

1) Abstract: This study aims to examine the role of physical health and cognitive function in disability among Chinese older adults, and how environmental factors influence these associations. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on data from two population-based studies in Shanghai and Singapore. Results showed that physical health and cognitive function were independently associated with disability, and this relationship was influenced by the environment.
 
2) Research and Discussion: The study found that physical health and cognitive function were both important factors in predicting disability among Chinese older adults. Environmental factors also played a significant role, with the prevalence of disability being higher in Shanghai than in Singapore. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to promote better health and cognitive function among older adults, especially in urban areas.
 
3) Results and Conclusion: The adjusted odds ratio showed that chronic diseases and self-rated health status had a significant impact on disability, while cognitive function and environment also played a role. The strength of these associations was found to be influenced by the environment, emphasizing the importance of considering both individual and environmental factors in addressing disability among older adults. Overall, this study highlights the need for a comprehensive and holistic approach to promote better health and reduce disability in older populations."
"conventional nontargeted 
 chemotherapeutics  such as antimetabolites  microtubule inhibitors  and dna intercalating / alkylating agents  are effective 
 at killing cancer cells  but due to their indiscriminate penetration 
 into nearly all cells  they can also damage healthy cells  causing 
 such toxicities as myelosuppression  alopecia  mucositis  peripheral 
 neuropathy  and cardiotoxicity . to minimize such collateral 
 damage to healthy tissues  physicians must often either reduce the 
 dosage or decrease the frequency of drug administration  leading to 
 incomplete elimination of diseased tissue . 
 on the basis of these considerations  
 recent approaches to cancer therapy have focused on developing methods 
 that specifically target chemotherapeutic agents to cancer cells  
 allowing for improved tumor suppression with fewer adverse events . 
 the most common approach to drug targeting has relied on the specificity 
 of a monoclonal antibody for its tumor - specific antigen . through the 
 conjugation of a highly cytotoxic drug to a tumor - specific antibody  
 tumor - selective drug delivery 
 examples of such tumor - targeted 
 antibody  drug conjugates ( adcs ) include trastuzumab emtansine and brentuximab vedotin . 
 although several 
 adcs have shown significant success in preclinical and clinical settings  
 some questions as to their ability to penetrate solid tumors have 
 been raised . 
 a related strategy to achieve tumor - selective drug delivery involves 
 the use of low molecular weight targeting ligands that can similarly 
 deliver attached drugs specifically to cancer cells . 
 drug conjugates ( figure 1a ) also target receptors that are overexpressed on malignant cells  
 and their much smaller sizes may permit more thorough tumor penetration .

 of the cck2r ligand crl conjugated to the cytotoxic antimicrotubule 
 agents desacetyl vinblastine hydrazide and tubulysin b hydrazide via 
 a hydrophilic peptide linker . in this paper  z-360  a low 
 molecular 
 weight ligand of the cholecystokinin 2 receptor ( cck2r )  is modified 
 to deliver two of the more potent antimicrotubule agents currently 
 available ( desacetyl vinblastine monohydrazide and tubulysin b hydrazide ) . 
 cck2r is a transmembrane receptor primarily found in epithelial cells 
 of the gi tract and brain  where it can bind gastrin and other amidated 
 peptides of the gastrin - cholecystokinin family . 
 cck2r is overexpressed on many cancers of the lung  pancreas  liver  
 and gi tract ( esophagus  colon  and gastrointestinal stromal tumors ) . because cck2r in the brain is inaccessible to drugs that can not 
 pass the blood brain barrier 
  this restricted expression pattern renders 
 cck2r a possible candidate for ligand - targeted drug delivery . 
 we report 
 here the design  synthesis  and biological evaluation of two highly 
 potent cck2r - targeted chemotherapeutic agents and demonstrate their

 a solution of disulfide activated - davbh 
 ( 11.10 mg  mmol ) in thf ( 2.0 ml ) was then added to the reaction mixture 
 ( si  figure 2 ) . 
 the progress of the reaction 
 was monitored using analytical lrms - lcms  and after stirring for 20 
 min  the reaction was found to reach completion . 
 crude crl - l1-davbh

 following the procedure outlined for the synthesis of crl - l1-davbh 
 ( si  figure 1 and 3 ) . 
 each compound was 
 then purified by reverse phase hplc [ a = 2 mm ammonium acetate buffer

 all conjugates were found to be stable in saline for at least four 
 weeks as monitored by lc - ms . 
 cck2r - transfected hek 293 cells ( 100000 
 cells / well ) were seeded on amine - coated 24-well plates and allowed 
 to form monolayers . 
 the spent medium in each well was replaced with 
 fresh medium containing increasing concentrations of the test agents . 
 after incubating for 2 h at 37 c 
  cells were rinsed 3 
 with fresh medium and then incubated an additional 66 h at 37 c 
 in fresh medium . 
 spent medium in each well was again replaced with 
 fresh medium ( 0.5 ml ) containing h - thymidine ( 1 ci / ml )  
 and the cells were incubated for an additional 4 h. after washing 
 the cells 3 with medium  they were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.25 
 m naoh . 
 thymidine incorporation was then determined by counting cell - associated 
 radioactivity using a scintillation counter ( packard  packard instrument 
 company ) . 
 the ic50 value was derived from a plot of the 
 percent of h - thymidine incorporation versus log concentration 
 using graph pad prism 4 and tablecurve 2d software . 
 hek 293 cells expressing cck2r 
 ( 5.0  10 in 50% hc matrigel ) were injected into 
 the shoulders of 56 week old female nu / nu mice . 
 an age - matched group of animals was similarly implanted with 
 1  10 kb cells in 100 l of cell culture medium . 
 because kb cells do not overexpress cck2r  the kb xenograft model 
 served as a negative control . 
 tumors were measured in two perpendicular 
 directions 3 per week with vernier calipers  and their volumes 
 were calculated as 0.5 x l x w  where l is the longest 
 axis ( in millimeters )  and w is the axis perpendicular to l ( in millimeters ) . 
 solutions were administered 
 either intraperitonealy ( crl - l1-davbh  l1-davbh ) or intravenously 
 ( crl - l1-tubbh  l1-tubbh  crl - l1 ) . 
 each mouse received 2 mol / kg 
 of the test or control agent in 100 l of saline per injection . 
 injections were given 3 per week for 3 weeks  and the mice were 
 weighed at each dosing as a measure of gross toxicity . 
 all animal 
 work was performed under the guidance of the purdue laboratory animal 
 program and was reviewed by the purdue animal care and use committee . 
 tumors were excised  fixed in 
 formalin  embedded in paraffin  sectioned  and stained with hematoxylin 
 and eosin by the purdue histology and phenotyping laboratory . 
 proper design of a ligand - targeted chemotherapeutic agent requires 
 ( i ) selection of a high affinity ligand with good selectivity for 
 a cancer - enriched receptor  ( ii ) identification of a therapeutic agent 
 with sufficient potency to kill cancer cells when captured by a cancer - specific 
 receptor  and ( iii ) construction of a linker that will enable delivery 
 and release of the attached drug preferentially within the targeted 
 cells . because cholecystokinin receptor ligand ( crl ) has been shown 
 to exhibit high affinity ( 0.47 nm ) and strong selectivity for cck2r 
 ( > 600-fold specificity over cck1r )  
 it 
 was selected for exploration as a targeting ligand for drug delivery 
 to cck2r - expressing cancer cells ( figure 1b ) . to avoid nonspecific adsorption to cck2r negative cells  we 
 incorporated 
 a water - soluble peptide spacer  referred 
 to as l1  between the ligand and its therapeutic payload ( figure 1b ) . 
 previous results from our lab have shown only 
 a slight loss of affinity with no effect on specificity when crl is 
 conjugated to its payload via hydrophilic linkers . in the present study  
 two highly potent microtubule 
 inhibitors  
 desacetyl vinblastine hydrazide ( davbh ) and tubulysin b hydrazide 
 ( tubbh )  were attached to the crl - l1 peptide spacer through a self - immolative 
 disulfide linker . 
 this linker allows 
 for selective release of the cytotoxic agent upon entry into the reducing 
 environment of cancer cells . 
 detailed schemes for the synthesis of 
 crl conjugates of davbh and tubbh are described in si figures 2 and 3 and complete chemical structures for all 
 conjugates can be found in si figures 47 . to determine the cytotoxicity and targeting specificity of the 
 crl - l1-davbh conjugate  we incubated crl - l1-davbh  free davbh  and 
 nontargeted l1-davbh with cck2r - transfected hek 293 cells for 2 h 
 followed by incubation of the cells in drug - free medium for 66 h. 
 cell viability was then measured via incorporation of h - thymidine . as shown in figure 2  the potency 
 of free davbh and crl - l1-davbh was 9 and 29 nm  respectively  whereas 
 the potency of the nontargeted conjugate l1-davbh was markedly reduced 
 by a factor of > 1000 ( ic50 value > 50 m ) . 
 importantly  
 crl by itself was found to show no cytotoxicity toward hek 293-cck2r 
 cells ( si  figure 8)  demonstrating that 
 the aforementioned cytotoxicity was due to the targeted therapeutic 
 agent rather than obstruction of cck2r by crl . in vitro cytotoxicity 
 of davbh derivatives . 
 the cytotoxicity of 
 free davbh ( circles )  the nontargeted l1-davbh ( triangles )  and the 
 targeted crl - l1-davbh ( squares ) conjugates in hek 293 cells transfected 
 with cck2r when pulsed for 2 h at 37 c  washed with culture 
 medium three times  and then incubated for an additional 66 h. cells 
 were incubated with h - thymidine for 4 h and washed three 
 times . after the final wash  the cells were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 
 0.25 m naoh . 
 viability of the cells was assessed by analyzing the 
 incorporation of h - thymidine . 
  
 we injected 2 mol / kg crl - l1-davbh 
 intraperitoneally into mice bearing cck2r - transfected hek 293 xenografts 
 at a frequency of 3x per week for 3 weeks ( n = 5 ) . 
 this dose was selected based on previous studies showing significant 
 therapeutic benefit when similar folate- and dupa - targeted chemotherapeutics 
 were administered at the same concentration . as shown in figure 3a  crl - l1-davbh 
 was found to markedly delay tumor growth but not 
 lead to complete tumor eradication . to determine whether the residual 
 lesion was comprised predominately of cancer or stromal cells  h&e 
 staining 
 was performed on excised tumors ( day 33 ) . unlike the saline 
 control  
 which was comprised of almost entirely of cancer cells ( figure 4a )  crl - l1-davbh - treated tumors exhibited a greatly 
 decreased ratio of cancer to stromal cells ( figure 4b ) . as expected  the nontargeted l1-davbh exerted little impact 
 on tumor growth  demonstrating the critical role of ligand targeting 
 on crl - l1-davbh efficacy ( figure 3a ) . 
 importantly  
 body weights in the crl - l1-davbh - treated group remained essentially 
 constant over the course of the study  suggesting that the targeted 
 therapy was not grossly toxic to the animals ( figure 3b ) . in vivo therapeutic efficacy and gross toxicity of davbh conjugates . 
 ( a ) volume of tumors and ( b ) percent weight change in nu / nu mice subcutaneously injected with cck2r - transfected hek 293 cells 
 ( 5.0  10 in 50% hc matrigel ) on day 0 . 
 mice were 
 randomized to different treatment groups ( n = 5 ) 
 and began treatment on day 15  when tumor volume was approximately 
 100 mm . 
 saline ( diamonds )  nontargeted l1-davbh ( triangles )  
 and targeted crl - l1-davbh ( squares ) conjugates were administered intraperitoneally 
 following a tiw schedule for 3 weeks . 
 excised tumors from mice treated with ( a ) saline or ( b ) crl - l1-davbh 
 were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin . 
 arrows show 
 the abundance of cancer cells in panel a and a reduced number of cancer 
 cells in panel b. because complete tumor 
 remission was not achieved at a dose of 
 2 g / kg with crl - l1-davbh  we elected to develop a more potent 
 cck2r - targeted conjugate . 
 for this purpose  tubulysin b hydrazide 
 ( tubbh )  a microtubule inhibitor with 10 the potency 
 of davbh  was conjugated to crl via the same l1 linker ( figure 1  si figures 2 and 3 ) . 
 as shown in figure 5a  free tubulysin b hydrazide 
 was found to be very potent in vitro  exhibiting an ic50 of 2.7 nm on hek 293-cck2r cells . 
 similarly  the targeted crl - l1-tubbh 
 conjugate yielded an ic50 of 2 nm  whereas nontargeted 
 l1-tubbh displayed the anticipated significant drop in potency ( ic50 of 310 nm ) due to its membrane impermeability and 
 lack of targeting . to ensure 
 that the cytotoxicity of crl - l1-tubbh 
 was receptor mediated  cells were incubated with crl - l1-tubbh in the 
 presence of 100-fold excess crl - l1 . 
 as expected  the ic50 value of the competed crl - l1-tubbh was nearly identical to that 
 of the nontargeted l1-tubbh conjugate ( ic50 of 340 
 and 310 nm  respectively ) . in vitro cytotoxicity of tubbh derivatives . 
 the cytotoxicity of 
 free tubbh ( circles )  the nontargeted l1-tubbh ( triangles )  the targeted 
 crl - l1-tubbh ( squares )  and the targeted crl - l1-tubbh in the presence 
 of 100-fold greater concentration competing crl - l1 ( diamonds ) conjugates 
 in hek 293 cells transfected with cck2r when pulsed for 2 h at 37 
 c  washed with culture medium three times  and then incubated 
 for an additional 66 h. cells were incubated with h - thymidine 
 for 4 h and washed three times . 
 after the final wash  the cells were 
 dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.25 m naoh . 
 viability of the cells was assessed 
 by analyzing the incorporation of h - thymidine . 
 error bars 
 represent standard deviation . to determine the efficacy of crl - l1-tubbh in vivo 
  we followed 
 the same treatment regimen used for davbh conjugates except that tubbh 
 conjugates were injected intravenously . 
 crl - l1-tubbh showed efficient 
 antitumor activity  eliminating all detectable malignant lesions from 
 all five mice ( figure 6a ) and prolonged survival 
 ( si  figure 9 ) . as expected  nontargeted 
 l1-tubbh showed no difference from the saline - treated control group 
 when an identical concentration as that of the crl - l1-tubbh targeted 
 conjugate was tested . 
 moreover  when crl - l1-tubbh was competed with 
 100-fold excess of crl - l1  the antitumor effect of the targeted tubbh 
 was negated ( figure 6a ) . 
 this indicates that 
 the antitumor activity observed in the crl - l1-tubbh group was entirely 
 receptor mediated . 
 importantly  the crl - l1-tubbh - treated mice displayed 
 no visible signs of gross toxicity  and no weight loss was observed 
 ( figure 6c ) . in vivo therapeutic efficacy and gross 
 toxicity of tubbh conjugates . 
 ( a  b ) volume of tumors and ( c  d ) percent weight change in nu / nu mice subcutaneously injected with 5.0  10 cck2r - transfected hek 293 cells ( cck2r(+ ) cells ) in 50% hc 
 matrigel ( a  c ) or 1.0  10 kb cells ( cck2r( ) 
 cells ) in 50% hc matrigel on day 0 . 
 mice were randomized to different 
 treatment groups ( n = 5 ) and began treatment on day 
 17  when the tumor volume was 100 mm . 
 saline ( diamonds )  
 nontargeted l1-tubbh ( triangles )  targeted crl - l1-tubbh ( squares )  
 and targeted crl - l1-tubbh in the presence of 100-fold greater concentration 
 of competing crl - l1 ( circles ) conjugates were administered via lateral 
 vein injection following a tiw schedule for 3 weeks . 
 finally  to more thoroughly establish the necessity of receptor - mediated 
 targeting for crl - l1-tubbh efficacy  the targeted conjugate was tested 
 using the same protocol in a cck2r - negative kb xenograft model . in 
 vitro crl - l1-tubbh conjugate yielded an ic50 value of 269 
 nm ( si  figure 9 )  similar to the ic50 values observed with the nontargeted and competed targeted 
 conjugates in the cck2r - expressing hek cells . 
 as shown in figure 6b  crl - l1-tubbh showed no difference in tumor growth 
 from the vehicle control . 
 because free tubulyisn b hydrazide is known 
 to be cytotoxic against kb cells  the 
 lack of reduction in tumor volume in the kb xenograft must derive 
 from the absence of cck2r and not from any intrinsic resistance to 
 tubbh . again 
  none of the mice in this study exhibited any signs of 
 gross toxicity  and no substantial weight loss was observed ( figure 6d ) . 
 conjugation of cytotoxic 
 drugs to ligands that selectively target 
 cancer cells has emerged as a promising method to both improve drug 
 efficacy and reduce drug toxicity . 
 although only a few low molecular 
 weight ligand - targeted cancer drugs have been tested in vivo to date  
 results suggest that the potential to design such targeted therapeutics 
 for most human malignancies is promising . 
 folate receptor - targeted 
 chemotherapeutic agents have demonstrated the capacity to treat malignancies 
 of the ovary  lung  kidney  breast  and endometrium  and psma - targeted drugs have shown promise for treating cancers 
 of the prostate . 
 lhrh receptor- and v3-targeted therapeutics can expand this 
 list to include cancers of the ovary and breast  but to date  few ligands are available to target cancers of the 
 gi tract . in this study  we attempted to obtain a ligand that would 
 deliver attached drugs to gastroinstestinal malignancies . 
 on the basis 
 of literature demonstrating overexpression of cck2r in gastrointestinal 
 stromal tumors and colon  stomach  esophageal  and pancreatic cancers  the crl conjugates described in this paper should have the potential 
 to address this deficiency . 
 one of the more interesting results 
 to emerge from this study was 
 the high specificity displayed by both crl - l1-davbh and crl - l1-tubbh 
 for cck2r - expressing cancer cells . 
 crl  davbh  and tubbh were all 
 found to be very hydrophobic  predicting that any conjugate of the 
 ligand to a drug would be extremely lipophilic  resulting in a strong 
 proclivity to associate nonspecifically with all cell membranes . 
 thus  
 to increase hydrophilicity  a water - soluble linker ( l1 ) was utilized 
 to conjugate crl to the cytotoxic drugs . 
 cck2r - dependent binding of 
 crl - l1-davbh and crl - l1-tubbh was established by the absence of toxicity 
 when ( i ) crl was deleted  ( ii ) conjugate binding was competed with 
 excess ligand  or ( iii ) cck2r was absent from the targeted cancer 
 cell . 
 drug 
 conjugates can be rendered tumor specific by the judicious choice 
 of a hydrophilic linker due to the linker impeding the diffusion of 
 the hydrophobic drug through the cell membranes  thus reducing nonspecific activity . 
 however  this effect 
 is somewhat concentration dependent as some conjugates can diffuse 
 into cells  and therefore at high concentrations  nonreceptor mediated 
 activity can occur . in the case of linking crl to davbh and tubbh  
 the insertion of a bulky water - soluble linker between the ligand and 
 drug converted an otherwise nonspecific drug conjugate into a highly 
 receptor - targeted drug conjugate at physiologically relevant concentrations . 
 our crl - tubbh conjugates were also tested against xenograft tumors 
 similar to those exposed to the davbh conjugates  except an additional 
 treatment group was included where crl - l1-tubbh was competed with 
 excess crl - l1 . 
 similar to the davbh conjugates  the nontargeted l1-tubbh 
 conjugate did not appear to have any effect on tumor growth . 
 the lack 
 of efficacy of l1-conjugated cytotoxic compounds in vivo is most likely 
 due to the hydrophilic linker  which does not allow for the cytotoxic 
 compound to readily diffuse through the cell membrane  whereas the 
 targeted crl - l1-davbh and crl - l1-tubbh both showed efficacy in vivo . 
 somewhat surprisingly  the crl - l1-davbh conjugate did not regress 
 tumor volume even though similar concentrations of davbh conjugated 
 to folate or dupa did exhibit tumor regression . 
 this result is most likely due to a lower 
 number of cck2r receptors present on the cell surface as compared 
 to folate or psma . 
 this resulting lack of tumor regression in vivo 
 encouraged the testing of a more potent cytotoxic agent with a similar 
 mechanism of action . 
 when the more potent crl - l1-tubbh conjugate was 
 tested  not only do it halt tumor growth  but it even regressed the 
 tumor to an indistinguishable level . 
 importantly  the crl - l1-tubbh 
 treatment group that was competed with crl - l1 showed no effect on 
 inhibiting tumor growth  similar to both the vehicle control and the 
 nontargeted conjugate . to further assess the necessity of receptor - mediated 
 targeting  we tested xenografts of the receptor - negative kb cell line 
 with the targeted crl - l1-tubbh conjugate . unlike the cck2r - positive 
 hek 293 xenografts  
 the kb xenografts showed neither regression nor 
 a delay of tumor growth when treated with the conjugate . taken together  
 these results strongly support the necessity of receptor - mediated 
 targeting with these conjugates for any in vivo efficacy . in 
 summary 
  the current study demonstrates that cck2r - targeting 
 ligands can be used to deliver drugs selectively to cck2r - positive 
 tumors to generate a dramatic receptor - specific antitumor effect without 
 observable gross toxicity to healthy tissues . 
 because current treatments 
 for colon  lung  pancreatic  and related cancers commonly cause hair 
 loss  bone marrow suppression  weight loss  and so forth  the prospects 
 for developing a less toxic treatment for these malignant diseases 
 offer some optimism for the management of these cancers in the future .","!

1) Abstract:
Conjugates targeting the cholecystokinin 2 receptor (CCK2R) have been developed as a means of delivering cytotoxic agents to malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract. These conjugates utilize small molecule ligands with high affinity for CCK2R, resulting in receptor-mediated cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. This technique shows promise for targeted cancer therapy.

2) Research and Discussion:
While many cancers have been targeted using antibodies and small molecule ligands, there is a need for additional specific targets for therapeutic delivery. The selective expression of CCK2R in the gastrointestinal tract makes it an attractive target for drug conjugates. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown promising results in terms of tumor regression or delayed growth with the use of CCK2R-targeting conjugates.

3) Results and Conclusion:
The success of CCK2R-targeting conjugates in delivering microtubule-disrupting drugs to gastrointestinal malignancies highlights the potential of this approach for selective and effective cancer therapy. The use of high affinity small molecule ligands allows for a highly specific and targeted delivery of cytotoxic agents, minimizing off-target effects and reducing the risk of side effects. Further research and validation of additional cellular targets for specific therapeutic delivery is crucial for the advancement of targeted cancer treatment."
"often  a new physics faculty member is faced with the duty of renovating the introductory physics labs . 
 we will provide a list of experiments and equipment needed to convert about half of the traditional labs on a 1-year introductory physics lab into microcomputer - based laboratories ( mbls ) . 
 our student body consists mostly of science majors that take the algebra - based course . 
 but  the lab renovation described here could be used for the calculus - based group as well . 
 we would suggest adjusting the lab manuals . nowadays  mbls are usually the choice when thinking of a renovation . 
 they have effectively demonstrated an advantage to the learning process over the years.[14 ] moreover  for our science students  the labs are important in reinforcing the concepts learned in class . 
 it is very common to hear  during the lab sections  students commenting on their grasp of the concept learned in class due to the experiment being performed . 
 the overall 1-year lab experience follows the guidelines provided by the american association of physics teachers . 
 it contains a brief theoretical description and the procedures to be followed on the day of the lab . on the lab day  the students should come prepared and ready to start without additional instructions . 
 the instructor circles around the stations to guide and answer appropriate questions if needed . on the lab day  the students are handed the lab report . 
 it contains a data analysis part  some discovery questions  and ends with a summary and conclusion part . the report is completed by the student during the session . 
 we did not find an appropriate version for the other half to meet our overall goal . 
 therefore  we kept a few traditional labs . the list of experiments is chosen based on the lecture material . 
 one of the concerns was to always be able to cover the theory before the lab was performed by the student . 
 one - year introductory microcomputer - based laboratory experiment list understanding motion  free fall  projectile motion  atwood 's machine  boyle 's law  electrical equivalent of heat  heat transfer  electrostatic charge  ohm 's law  rc circuit  and magnetic induction . 
 a suggestion for the beginner is to try all the experiments before hand until you get really familiar with the sensors and software and how they work . 
 most of the time  it is a lack of understanding of the use of the apparatus  assuming it is not defective of course . 
 we will list here the total equipment needed per station to implement the 1-year lab described above . 
 it is expected that the laboratory will have a printer that can be shared among all groups . 
 each station consists of a laptop and the science workshop 750 interface ( ci-7650 ) with the datastudio software ( ci-6870 g ) . 
 lab station : science workshop interface  laptop and motion sensor sensors to be used with the interface for data measurement : motion sensor ( ci-6742a )  photogate and pulley system ( me-6838 )  accessory photogate ( me-9204b )  time - of - flight accessory ( me-6810 )  pressure sensor ( ci-6532a )  temperature sensor ( ci6605a )  power amplifier ( ci-6552a )  charge sensor ( ci-6555 )  voltage sensor ( ci-6503 )  photogate head ( me-9498a ) . 
 figure 2 displays a few sensors . from left to right : pressure sensor  charge sensor  and photogate head the datastudio software collects and analyzes the data . 
 it has an easy - to - use interface  allowing the students to explore the data . 
 for instance  the left screenshot in ure 3 displays a graph of voltage versus time . 
 the data are collected using a voltage sensor when a magnet is dropped through a coil . 
 the students can select a region on the graph and the software calculates the area under the curve . 
 the screenshot on the right in figure 3 displays the curve - fitting feature of datastudio . left screenshot : induction lab using graph and area under the curve calculation . 
 the pressure column will be filled as the measurements are taken using the pressure sensor . 
 boyle 's law lab using a table display the additional equipment needed from pasco to perform the experiments are : picket fence ( me-9377a )  projectile mini launcher ( me-6825a )  photogate mounting bracket ( me-6821a )  extension cable ( pi-8117 )  thermodynamics kit ( ci-6514a )  charge producers ( ci-6555 )  faraday ice pail ( es-9057b )  ac / dc electronics lab ( em-8656 )  and bar magnet ( em-8620 ) . 
 general lab supplies needed include a pair of scissors and goggles  one digital balance  ohaus ( sp-601 )  one meterstick  one thermometer  tongs ( handling hot bottles )  gloves ( handle hot containers )  braided physics string ( se-8050 )  500 ml glass container ( 90c water )  banana plug cord red and black ( 5 on set ) ( se-9750 ) or ( se-975 )  masses and hanger set ( me-8979 )  universal table clamp ( me-9376b )  calorimetry cups ( td-8825a )  and hot plates ( se-8830 ) . 
 oftentimes  this task is hard to accomplish for a solo faculty in a small institution . 
 we provided here a list of the experiments and equipments needed to upgrade about half the experiments to mbls on a 1-year introductory physics lab . 
 we would like to add that although we used pasco  there are other comparable systems in the market . 
 the intention of this paper is to help others with their own lab renovation . in order to better fulfill this purpose ","

Abstract: This paper discusses the health hazards posed by metallic, aromatic, and oxygenated additives in gasoline and their risks in industrialized and developing countries. Technological advancements have allowed the removal of lead and control of exhaust emissions in industrialized countries, but developing countries face challenges due to lax environmental standards and imported hazardous materials.

Research and Discussion: The effects of these additives on public health are examined, with a focus on the growing dependence on private automobiles in developing countries. Financial barriers to modernization and the importation of lead additives contribute to the escalation of environmental health problems in these nations.

Results and Conclusion: It is imperative for international public health standards to be adopted and for efforts to decrease dependence on private vehicles for urban transportation to be implemented in order to reduce the negative impact on public health from gasoline additives.

"type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) is a growing epidemic : in the united states of america alone  nearly 25.8 million people ( approx 8.3% of the total population ) have the disease.1 estimates have placed the global prevalence of the disease at around 217 million.2 the consequence to the individual of prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia is a marked increase in the risk of mortality and morbidity  with an associated reduction in life expectancy of around 1213 years.3 diagnosis usually occurs some time after development of the disease and they have often already experienced occult pathology by the time patients receive a diagnosis . early adoption of an aggressive approach to disease management improves patient outcome  with marked reductions in morbidity and mortality.46 the first line approach to treatment is through lifestyle modification.7 however  t2 dm is progressive in nature  and lifestyle changes sufficient to halt the disease are difficult to achieve . 
 intense efforts by patients and the healthcare team frequently fail . similarly  most conventional antidiabetic drugs ( eg  metformin  sulfonylureas etc . ) often fail to slow the progression of t2 dm  despite the availability of a broad range of agents employing different mechanisms of action.79 the progressive nature of the disease and how it overwhelms available therapies was highlighted in the ukpds study ; suggesting that fewer than half of all patients actually achieve adequate levels of disease control.45 there is a recognized need for new treatment options for t2 dm . 
 characterization of the mechanisms facilitating glucose resorption by the kidney has raised the possibility of a novel treatment for diabetes : inhibition of the type 2 sodium - glucose transporter ( sglt2 )  a 672 amino - acid  high capacity  low affinity transmembrane protein that promotes reabsorption of glucose as the glomerular filtrate passes down the nephrons.10 several candidate molecules are currently in development and may soon be available for use in the treatment of diabetes . 
 we provide a brief review of sglt2 inhibitors and their possible role in the treatment of t2 dm . 
 most ( > 99% ) of the plasma glucose entering the kidney filters into the nephrons though the glomeruli . under normal circumstances  
 the reabsorptive capacity of the early part of the nephron  the proximal tubule  is sufficient to clear the filtered glucose load from the luminal fluid before it enters the loop of henl . in normal individuals  
 around 180 g of glucose passes into the proximal tubules each day  from where it is almost completely reabsorbed.1112 as plasma glucose concentrations increase  the filtered glucose load increases in a linear manner . 
 when the rate of glucose entering the nephron rises above 260350 mg / min/1.73 m  for example in patients with diabetes  the excess glucose outstrips resorptive capacity and appears in the urine ( glycosuria).13 in a healthy adult  this equates to a blood glucose concentration of approximately 11 mmol / l ( 200 mg / dl).14 as much as 90% of the filtered glucose load is extracted in the s1 segment  and the remaining 10% is removed in the distal straight tubules ( s2 and s3 segments ) ( figure 1 ) . until recently  
 the mechanisms behind glucose reabsorption were poorly understood  although it was proposed as early as 1960 that glucose transmembrane flux could be achieved through the coupling of glucose transport with that of sodium.15figure 1summary of glucose reabsorption from the lumen of the nephrons .

 the majority of glucose reabsorption is believed to occur in the early part of the proximal tubule . since the start of the 20 century  
 phlorizin  a toxic 2-glucoside of phloretin  has been known to increase glycosuria  and has been used in the study of renal function.1617 during the 1930s  phlorizin was used in non - invasive human experiments that revealed some of the fundamental mechanisms of renal hemodynamics and metabolic transport.18 in the 1950s  studies delineated phlorizin s mechanism of action on inhibition of glucose transport in the kidney and small intestine at the cellular and molecular levels . 
 renal micropuncture studies conducted with phlorizin in the 1970s showed that the transporter was located in the brush border of the proximal tubule  and that sodium was required for the renal absorption of glucose.111920 studies performed since then confirmed that phlorizin is a competitive inhibitor of glucose transport  with a binding affinity for the transporter that is 1000- to 3000-fold greater than that of glucose.21 the rabbit homolog of the human type 1 sodium - glucose transporter ( sglt1 )  which is coded by the slc5a gene  was the first mammalian cotransporter carrier protein to be identified  cloned  and sequenced.22 a family of slc5a gene sodium - dependent transporters has since been sequenced and identified in a broad range of tissues.2324 sglt1 and sglt2 are  perhaps  the slc5a family members that have received greatest coverage within the literature . the high affinity  low capacity slgt1 is the main gastrointestinal glucose transporter 
 the relatively widespread distribution of sglt1 is contrasted by the almost exclusive expression on the luminal surface of proximal tubules ( mainly in the renal cortex ) of the low glucose affinity  high capacity sglt2  responsible for most renal tubular glucose reabsorption.2226 cellular glucose and sodium uptake occurs in a 1:1 ratio ( figure 2 ) . 
 the sodium : potassium adenosine triphosphatase ( atp ) pump transports sodium across the basolateral surface into the intracellular fluid  maintaining the physiological levels of sodium in the cell . 
 cellular glucose concentrations are maintained by facilitative glucose outflow through transporters in the basolateral membrane of the cell . 
 after binding intracellular glucose the transporters undergo a conformational change that subsequently moderates the movement of glucose ( down its concentration gradient ) back into the blood ( figure 3 ) .

 the antidiabetic properties of phlorizin were investigated in the 1980s . in partially pancreatectomized rats  
 phlorizin increased glucose secretion in urine and this was associated with a normalizing of plasma glucose  without inducing hypoglycemia.17 despite its promising in vitro properties  phlorizin does not fit the profile that we have come to expect from a modern therapeutic agent . 
 phlorizin is also potentially toxic and is non - selective  inhibiting both sglt1 and sglt2 transporters . in the last decade  
 several alternative candidate molecules  targeted to specifically inhibit sglt2  have been investigated in both pre - clinical and clinical settings.27 the aim has been to take advantage of the potential for  turning - off glucose reabsorption as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of t2 dm . 
 first reports of devised sglt2 inhibitors started to emerge in the scientific literature in the second half of the 1990s . developed with a view to overcoming the shortcomings of phlorizin  sglt2 inhibitors represented a new mechanism to manage hyperglycemia that acted independently of insulin and irrespective of patients glycemic status . 
 first indications suggest that the mechanism of action  which is independent of insulin  further reduces glycemia when used in combination with traditional antidiabetic treatments . 
 results with early compounds were promising in terms of specificity for the transporter : the compound t-1095 has inhibitory capacity for sglt2 that is 4-fold greater than for sglt1.25 pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated attenuated hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia in kk rats following oral administration of t-1095.26 lowering of insulin resistance and hba1c levels along with normalized hepatic glucose production and glucose utilization rate were also observed in streptozotocin - induced diabetic rats2628 and zucker diabetic fatty rats2829 following oral administration of t-1095 . 
 long - term administration of t-1095 restored impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic -cells in goto - kakizaki ( gk ) rats30 and suppressed diabetic complications in both c57bl / ksj - db / db mice and gk rats.3132 however  retained co - inhibition of sglt1 by t-1095 led to development of the compound being discontinued in 2003  having reached phase ii clinical trials . 
 various sglt2 inhibitors based on the glucoside structure of phlorizin have since been proposed ( table 1 )  and narratives of the discovery pathway of the different inhibitors have recently been published.2733 the glucoside moiety of phlorizin binds to sglt2 transporters and the  o-linked phenolic distal ring is responsible for its inhibitory properties.34 structure - activity analysis of the parent molecule shows that addition of lipophilic groups to the distal ring augments the inhibition of the sglt2 transporter  and increases selectivity for sglt2 over sglt1.25 however  the o - linkage is a metabolic target for -glucosidase enzymes that can curtail the activity of sglt2 inhibitors in vivo . to address this possible limitation to therapeutic utility  candidate sglt2 inhibitors 
 both the o- and c - glucosides appear to bind to a single site on the sglt2 transporter . 
 the aromatic and heteroaromatic c - glucosides are metabolically more stable than o - glucosides  due to their relative resistance to hydrolysis . 
 alternative candidate sglt2 inhibitors that have also been considered include modified sugar rings  n - glucosides and  more recently  a bridged ketal ring.35table 1candidate sglt2 inhibitorsmanufacturers : johnson & johnson / tanabe seiyaku co. ltd ( japan ) ( t-1095 ) ; sanofi - aventis ( ave-2268 ) ; glaxosmithkline ( remogliflozin / kgt 1681/sergliflozin ) ; wyeth ( way-123783 ) ; astellas pharma inc ( asp 1941/ym-543 ) ; boehringer ingelheim gmbh ( bi-10773/bi-44847 ) ; boehringer ingelheim  gmbh / ajinomoto ( canagliflozin ) ; johnson & johnson / tanabe mitsubishi ( ta-7284/jnj 28431754 ) ; bristol - myers squibb co / astrazeneca ( dapagliflozin ) ; lexicon ( lx 4211 ) ; isis pharmaceuticals ( isis 388626 ) ; roche / chugai ( r7201/csg452 ) ; pfizer ( pf-04971729 ) .

 as the above discussion suggests  there are several hypothetical reasons why the sglt2 transporter represents an opportune target for managing blood glucose . 
 however  the challenge is to establish therapeutic utility while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile . 
 a detailed summary of clinical findings has recently been published.55 the mechanism of action of sglt2 inhibitors predicts a beneficial effect  but the long - term glucose lowering capacity in a clinical setting may not impart significant reductions in hba1c . 
 modest hba1c lowering in the region of 0.5%0.9%  that may be predicted from early clinical studies  would be comparable to that achieved with other currently marketed oral agents.55 it remains to be seen whether promoting glucose excretion will result in long - term benefits for the patient in terms of returning metabolic balance  or even weight loss . 
 clearly  blocking glucose reabsorption permits the clearance of glucose from the body  and thus must eventually serve to reduce levels of plasma glucose . 
 the amount of glucose available for excretion is dependent on the amount entering the nephrons  which  in turn  depends on blood glucose concentration at the glomerulus . 
 thus  the amount of glucose excreted is greater when the blood plasma glucose concentrations are highest . in effect  glucose 
 removal might be expected only to be greatest at times when it is most needed ( when glucose levels are highest )  such as during post - prandial hyperglycemia . 
 the benefit to those patients in whom treatment has provided mild - to - moderate glycemic control might be questioned  as the potential for glucose excretion would be relatively low . 
 nevertheless  patients who achieve moderate glycemic control may be exposed to clinically relevant post - prandial glucose excursions that can impart disproportionate effects on hba1c and possibly the morbidity and mortality associated with t2dm.56 in such a patient population  sglt2 inhibitors might attenuate the impact of post - prandial glucose spikes . nevertheless  clinical experience with agents  such as the meglitinides  that target post - prandial glucose control  suggest that the clinical benefit of this approach is disappointing . 
 treatments targeting post - prandial glucose levels provide little more than modest improvements in hba1c with little evidence of long - term outcome benefits for patients.57 as sglt2 may be responsible for as much as 90% of glucose reabsorption by the kidney  there is the clinical potential for as much as 160 g of glucose to be excreted each day following effective sglt2 inhibition.23 however  it appears that the actual glucose loss achieved in clinical studies is only about half that predicted.38 it is not clear whether this is a consequence of compensating mechanisms undertaking tubular reabsorption or incomplete inhibition of the transporter . 
 thus far  the safety profile of sglt2 inhibitors reported from clinical studies appears to fulfill expectations.3334554058 sglt2 inhibitors are  designed to target a highly specific membrane transporter that is almost exclusively expressed within the renal tubules . clearly  compared with less specific molecules  the potential for 
 it is also unlikely that sglt2 inhibitors will induce hypoglycemia  since when plasma glucose levels are low the amount of glucose excreted will also be low.59 this prediction appears to be confirmed by clinical studies reported thus far  which show no apparent increases in hypoglycemic episodes with sglt2 inhibitors.5060 even when sglt2 is blocked completely  a degree of renal glucose recovery is maintained via the relatively unhindered sglt1 transporter . 
 one aspect of sglt2 inhibition that has been raised as a potential issue of safety concern is that of glycosuria  which could predispose patients to increased urinary tract infections ( uti ) . 
 there have been some reports of infection in clinical studies.6061 however  a study that reviewed risk factors for developing utis in women with diabetes observed that glucosuria was not a significant contributing factor.62 interestingly  there is a rare group of individuals who do not express the sglt2 transporter or in which its functionality has been partially or completely lost due to a genetic mutation for which both an autosomal recessive and dominant pattern of inheritance has been reported . 
 these people do not appear to suffer any ill consequences  suggesting that blockade of the transporter per se in t2 dm patients would offer no immediate risk . patients expressing these mutations have decreased renal tubular reabsortion of glucose from the lumen in the absence of hyperglycemia  or any other signs of tubular dysfunction . 
 it is not clear whether familial renal glucosuria ( due to sglt2 mutation ) protects against t2 dm ; although sglt2 deletion in animal models appears to improve glucose homeostasis and preserve pancreatic -cell function.63 we did not find any recorded evidence of an increased disposition to urinary tract or vulvovaginal infections  although identification and study of these subjects is difficult due to the rarity of the disease . clearly 
  clinical development programs will need to address the concern of a possible increased risk of uti . 
 increased glucose content in the urine following sglt2 inhibition will likely serve to increase urinary flow as a consequence of the osmotic diuretic effect in the lumen of the nephron . 
 this could result in modest  possibly beneficial  reductions in blood pressure  but raises additional safety concerns associated with possible loss of fluid and solutes . 
 this may be of particular concern in elderly patients or those who do not have the capacity to maintain their fluid balance . 
 however  it should be noted that the effect is considerably lower than that seen with frequently used loop diuretics and there is no apparent change in glomerular filtration rate that would be indicative of a direct effect on renal function . 
 simple instructions on maintaining a state of hydration with regular drinks may serve to overcome the concerns over both urinary infection and fluid imbalance .

 simple instructions on maintaining a state of hydration with regular drinks may serve to overcome the concerns over both urinary infection and fluid imbalance . 
 the question arises as to where sglt2 inhibitors might fit in the current cascade of treatments for the management of t2 dm . 
 while treatment of t2 dm follows prescribed guidelines  there are many approaches and permutations to their application in clinical practice . 
 although the sglt2 inhibitors mechanism of action would make them suitable for initial monotherapy in patients with early stage t2 dm  it is unlikely they would be considered at this stage . 
 most treatments are currently initiated with metformin  which is relatively inexpensive  has a good historical safety profile  and is efficacious . 
 clearly  when they are first launched  the sglt2 inhibitors will not be able to compete with metformin  purely on the issue of cost . 
 however  as explained earlier  the advantage of this may be minimal in patients achieving a degree of glycemic control . by promoting an 
 escape mechanism for glucose  sglt2 inhibitors introduce a new mode to the control of t2 dm . with the exception of -glucosidase inhibitors  which block glucose uptake from the gut  all currently available antidiabetic therapies directly or indirectly modulate insulin to manipulate endogenous glucose utilization . despite the modest effect on hba1c predicted for sglt2 inhibitors  
 the introduction of a novel means of reducing hyperglycemia increases the treatment options available to physicians for a disease that frequently requires the use of multiple agents to achieve control targets.57 the expected favorable safety profile and insulin - independent mechanism of action appear to support the use of sglt2 inhibitors in combination with other antidiabetic drugs . 
 insulin - dependent therapies become less effective with the development of insulin resistance and/or deterioration of -cell function ; particularly in patients with low insulin resistance ( high glucose ) or poorly controlled disease . 
 the insulin - independent action of sglt2 inhibitors suggests potential for a synergistic effect in such scenarios . 
 the insulin - independent action of sglt2 inhibitors also means that they may be of use in type 1 diabetes  perhaps as a means of moderating post - prandial glucose excursions . by increasing excretion of glucose  
 sglt2 inhibitors offer an opportunity to increase calorie loss in t2 dm patients  most of whom are overweight . 
 the continual loss of 8090 g of glucose per day ( 300400 calories ) is a significant loss of calories that should work synergistically with weight reduction programs.64 short - term studies in both animals and man appear to confirm the predicted weight reducing property . 
 this contrasts with several drug therapies  including sulfonylureas  insulin  and thiazolidinediones  which are generally associated with weight gain.6566 but there are currently no data to confirm whether the rate of calorie loss continues with chronic therapy . in a clinical setting it would be easy to overcome any 
 benefits that patients may derive from sglt2 inhibition if they perceived the drug as a means of 
 acclimatized to higher levels of plasma glucose would experience a marked change in appetite with substantial loss of glucose / calories.67 one final issue is that for these drugs to work  they need to be delivered to the epithelial luminal surface of the nephron  requiring them to be cleared by the glomerulus . 
 consequently  their efficacy may be affected in those instances when the functioning of the kidney is impaired  for example in diabetic nephropathy . 
 most patients with t2 dm eventually succumb to the progressive nature of the disease and will  at some point  require multiple therapies to attain treatment targets . only half the patients with t2 
 dm achieve the hba1c target of less than 7%  despite the many different treatment options currently available . 
 with sglt2 inhibitors introducing an alternative means of managing glucose  we gain a further treatment option that may increase our ability to control t2 dm . 
 experience will lead to better understanding of which patients are likely to respond best  and under what circumstances .","

Abstract:

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM) is a prevalent condition that requires new treatment options. The use of specific inhibitors of the type 2 sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT2) shows promise in promoting glucose excretion and normalizing glycemia in animal models. This class of drugs also appears to have a favorable safety profile and may be used in conjunction with other antidiabetic medications.

Research and Discussion:

Research on SGLT2 inhibitors began in the late 1990s and several candidates are currently in clinical trials. Their target, which is highly specific and mainly expressed in the renal tubules, indicates a good safety profile. However, there is a concern for increased glycosuria and urinary tract infections. More experience is needed to determine the best candidates for this treatment and in what circumstances it will be most effective.

Results and Conclusion:

The use of SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with other antidiabetic drugs has the potential to improve glucose control and promote weight loss through calorie excretion. The results from clinical studies have shown good tolerability, supporting their use in patients with T2 DM. Further research is needed to determine where SGLT2 inhibitors will fit in the current treatment options for T2 DM. "
"the goal of defibrillation ( df ) testing is to verify the detection of ventricular tachyarrhythmias by implantable cardioverter - defibrillators ( icds )  and to ascertain df efficacy . 
 all clinical trials  which demonstrated the benefit of icd therapy  have included some kind of df testing . according to the food and drug administration  
 the instructions for use of icds include the recommendation  with df testing at the time of implantation . 
 the absence of df testing may have medico - legal implications whether a device fails to terminate ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) during follow - up . 
 nevertheless  df testing has been deliberately omitted in the majority of patients enrolled in contemporary icd studies . despite the stochastic nature of df  ineffective shocks during vf induction result in system modifications in up to 5% of patients . 
 system modifications  such as repositioning of the electrode  reversal of polarity  use of a high - energy device  use of a dual instead of a single - coil electrode  or the implantation of an additional subcutaneous electrode  may be unnecessary or even harmful since many patients have a successful retesting with the original system configuration . 
 no single system modification in itself has ever been shown to improve outcome . with current devices and programming  
 an inadequate safety margin occurs infrequently  and the incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring shocks is low at 46% per year . while df testing has never been shown to improve survival  it is associated with an increased  albeit small risk of major adverse events of 0.4% . by omitting routine df testing  
 the approach to icd implantation will likely change considerably  as the procedures will be shorter and performed without technical support and anaesthesia . 
 similar to the simple trial  we hypothesized that  with current high - energy icd devices  the omission of df testing during implantation will not result in an inferior shock efficacy during follow - up when compared with standard df testing . 
 as opposed to the simple trial  which used the composite outcome of arrhythmic death or failed appropriate shock  the primary end point of our study was the shock efficacy of all true ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) and vf episodes occurring in any patient during follow - up . 
 the nordic icd trial ( nct01282918 ) was a prospective  randomized  parallel group  multi - centre non - inferiority trial conducted at 48 centres in five european countries  and designed to investigate the effect of df testing at the time of icd implantation on first shock efficacy ( fse ) during follow - up . 
 briefly  patients with an indication for icd implantation according to the current european society of cardiology guidelines were included . 
 patients with hypertrophic or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy were excluded because of special considerations necessary during icd implantation . 
 one thousand and seventy - seven patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to first time icd implantation with or without df testing during the procedure . 
 patients were followed for at least 12 months through regular on - site visits  and remotely via home monitoring ( hm ; biotronik se & co. kg  berlin  germany ) . 
 all true ventricular tachyarrhythmias treated with an icd shock in any patient were included in the primary analysis . 
 the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki  and country - specific regulatory requirements . 
 the protocol was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee of each participating centre . 
 a standard df testing protocol was used by all participating centres  as described previously . 
 briefly  the initial shock for df was programmed to 15 j. if successful  df testing was terminated . if unsuccessful  a second shock programmed to 24 j was delivered  and had to be confirmed . 
 if unsuccessful  a system revision was recommended  and the df testing procedure was repeated . 
 the primary end point was the fse to terminate all true episodes of vt / vf during follow - up . 
 a blinded two - member clinical event committee reviewed the diagnostic information of the vt / vf treated with icd shocks . 
 safety end points included procedural serious adverse events  vt / vf conversion rate  and all - cause  cardiac  or arrhythmic mortality during follow - up . 
 all adverse events were reviewed and adjudicated by a data and safety monitoring board ( dsmb )  consisting of three members . 
 all patient deaths were adjudicated by the dsmb according to a classification originally described by epstein et al . 
 the goal of the nordic icd trial was to demonstrate the non - inferiority of no df testing when compared with df testing with respect to the primary endpoint of fse . 
 this margin was chosen because the variation of fse in published trials was in the range of 8392% . 
 after a pre - specified blinded re - assessment  the sample size was increased to 1080 patients recruited over a period of 28 months  with a follow - up of at least 12 months . 
 the intention - to - treat ( itt ) population which included all randomized patients  the evaluated - for - safety population which included randomized patients who received an icd  and the per protocol ( pps ) population which included randomized patients who received an icd and did not have a major protocol violation .

 the nordic icd trial ( nct01282918 ) was a prospective  randomized  parallel group  multi - centre non - inferiority trial conducted at 48 centres in five european countries  and designed to investigate the effect of df testing at the time of icd implantation on first shock efficacy ( fse ) during follow - up . 
 briefly  patients with an indication for icd implantation according to the current european society of cardiology guidelines were included . 
 patients with hypertrophic or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy were excluded because of special considerations necessary during icd implantation . 
 one thousand and seventy - seven patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to first time icd implantation with or without df testing during the procedure . 
 patients were followed for at least 12 months through regular on - site visits  and remotely via home monitoring ( hm ; biotronik se & co. kg  berlin  germany ) . 
 all true ventricular tachyarrhythmias treated with an icd shock in any patient were included in the primary analysis . 
 the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki  and country - specific regulatory requirements . 
 the protocol was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee of each participating centre . 
 a standard df testing protocol was used by all participating centres  as described previously . 
 briefly  the initial shock for df was programmed to 15 j. if successful  df testing was terminated . if unsuccessful  a second shock programmed to 24 j was delivered  and had to be confirmed . 
 if the shocks were successful twice  df testing was terminated . if unsuccessful  a system revision was recommended  and the df testing procedure was repeated . 
 the primary end point was the fse to terminate all true episodes of vt / vf during follow - up . 
 a blinded two - member clinical event committee reviewed the diagnostic information of the vt / vf treated with icd shocks . 
 safety end points included procedural serious adverse events  vt / vf conversion rate  and all - cause  cardiac  or arrhythmic mortality during follow - up . 
 all adverse events were reviewed and adjudicated by a data and safety monitoring board ( dsmb )  consisting of three members . 
 all patient deaths were adjudicated by the dsmb according to a classification originally described by epstein et al . 
 the goal of the nordic icd trial was to demonstrate the non - inferiority of no df testing when compared with df testing with respect to the primary endpoint of fse . 
 this margin was chosen because the variation of fse in published trials was in the range of 8392% . 
 after a pre - specified blinded re - assessment  the sample size was increased to 1080 patients recruited over a period of 28 months  with a follow - up of at least 12 months . 
 the intention - to - treat ( itt ) population which included all randomized patients  the evaluated - for - safety population which included randomized patients who received an icd  and the per protocol ( pps ) population which included randomized patients who received an icd and did not have a major protocol violation . 
 however  for time - dependent outcomes  these patients were included up to the date of the protocol violation . 
 the primary analysis was performed in the per protocol episode data set ( p - pps )  which included all sufficiently documented shocked episodes in pps patients . 
 baseline characteristics are presented group wise for the itt population as mean ( sd ) or frequency ( % ) . to compensate for the dependence structure induced by recurrent episodes with similar outcome in some of the patients  a random effects logit model with patients as a random factor and group as a fixed factor was used for calculation of a two - sided 95% confidence interval ( ci ) of the difference fsenodftest  fsedftest . to state non - inferiority  this ci had to lie completely above the pre - specified non - inferiority margin of 10% . without the use of a model that takes the correlation structure into account  the few patients with an extreme numbers of shocks would have dominated the results . 
 procedural and safety outcomes were compared with a student 's t test  or  test or fisher 's exact test  whichever was appropriate . 
 mortality was analysed in the itt population using the kaplan  meier approach and the log - rank test . 
 hazard rate reduction was assessed using a cox proportional hazards model . a two - tailed p - value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant . 
 data were analysed using sas ( version 9.4 ) and stata ( version 13.1 ) by an independent statistical institute ( department of medical biometry and epidemiology  university medical centre hamburg eppendorf  germany ) ( a.s .  k.w . ) .

 four hundred and ninety - four of 519 inducible patients ( 95.2% ) passed the test without any system reconfiguration  and 440 patients ( 84.8% ) had their vt / vf terminated with a 15 j shock . in 25 patients  
 the initial df test was not successful  and system reconfigurations were performed once in 20 and more than once in 5 ( table 2 ) . 
 all patients subsequently passed the test successfully  but still with a higher energy level at the final position ( 22.2  7.4 j vs. 16.4  4.0 j  p < 0.001 ) and with significantly more shocks ( 5.7  3.0 vs. 1.2  0.7  p < 0.001 ) than the 494 patients who passed the test immediately . 
 in addition  the duration of the procedure ( 90.2  56.2 min vs. 63.5  36.1 min  p < 0.001 ) and fluoroscopy exposure ( 11.6  14.2 min vs. 7.5  10.7 min  p = 0.064 ) was increased . during a median follow - up of 22.7 and 22.9 months  respectively  211 true vt / vf episodes with at least one appropriate shock occurred in 8.6% of the per protocol patients with df testing  while 218 true vt / vf episodes occurred in 8.8% of patients without df testing ( table 3  figure 1 ) . 
 all true vt / vf episodes were terminated with any appropriate icd shock in the without df test group  whereas 96.7% of all vt / vf were terminated in the group with df test . 
 thus  the conversion efficacy was 100.0% without df testing and 96.7% with df testing . 
 the model - based shock efficacy was 97.1% without df testing and 94.1% with df testing . 
 the difference in fse was 3.0% ( ci 3.0%  9.0% ) in favour of the without df test group  and remained above the pre - defined 10% margin for the primary end point ( pnon - inferiority < 0.001  table 3  figure 2 ) .

 of the 534 patients randomized to the df arm with a successful first icd implantation ( figure 1 )  testing was performed in 97.4% . in one patient  vt / vf was not inducible . 
 four hundred and ninety - four of 519 inducible patients ( 95.2% ) passed the test without any system reconfiguration  and 440 patients ( 84.8% ) had their vt / vf terminated with a 15 j shock . in 25 patients  
 the initial df test was not successful  and system reconfigurations were performed once in 20 and more than once in 5 ( table 2 ) . 
 all patients subsequently passed the test successfully  but still with a higher energy level at the final position ( 22.2  7.4 j vs. 16.4  4.0 j  p < 0.001 ) and with significantly more shocks ( 5.7  3.0 vs. 1.2  0.7  p < 0.001 ) than the 494 patients who passed the test immediately . 
 in addition  the duration of the procedure ( 90.2  56.2 min vs. 63.5  36.1 min  p < 0.001 ) and fluoroscopy exposure ( 11.6  14.2 min vs. 7.5  10.7 min  p = 0.064 ) was increased . 
 during a median follow - up of 22.7 and 22.9 months  respectively  211 true vt / vf episodes with at least one appropriate shock occurred in 8.6% of the per protocol patients with df testing  while 218 true vt / vf episodes occurred in 8.8% of patients without df testing ( table 3  figure 1 ) . 
 all true vt / vf episodes were terminated with any appropriate icd shock in the without df test group  whereas 96.7% of all vt / vf were terminated in the group with df test . 
 thus  the conversion efficacy was 100.0% without df testing and 96.7% with df testing . 
 the model - based shock efficacy was 97.1% without df testing and 94.1% with df testing . 
 the difference in fse was 3.0% ( ci 3.0%  9.0% ) in favour of the without df test group  and remained above the pre - defined 10% margin for the primary end point ( pnon - inferiority < 0.001  table 3  figure 2 ) .

 the only significant difference in single serious adverse events was intra - operative hypotension  which manifested more often in patient with df testing ( 1.7% ) than those without df testing ( 0.0% ) ( p = 0.004 ) . 
 lead - related complications occurred in 15 patients without df testing ( 2.8% ) compared with 24 events in 21 patients with df testing ( 3.9% ) ( p = 0.311 ) . 
 one sudden death occurred in each study group within 30 days of follow - up  and the mean length of hospitalization was 4.0 days in both study groups ( table 1 ) . 
 the proportion of patients with inappropriate shocks during follow - up was low at 3.7%  and similar between groups .

 defibrillation testing during icd implantation has been a matter of debate for the last two decades . to the best of our knowledge  
 the nordic icd trial is the first prospective randomized trial  which investigated the effect of df testing on the actual fse during follow - up as the single primary end point . 
 this is in contrast with the recently published simple trial  which used the composite outcome of arrhythmic death or failed appropriate shock to terminate a spontaneous episode of vt / vf to determine the non - inferiority of the no testing approach . 
 nordic icd also provides detailed information about intra - operative df testing outcome . in 9196% of icd implants  
 system modifications were reported in 2.212.0% of patients . with the high - energy devices used in the nordic icd study  only 4.8% of all inducible patients had an inadequate safety margin  which required one or two system reconfigurations in 3.8 and 1.0%  respectively . 
 this is in agreement with the results of the sudden cardiac death in heart failure trial ( scd - heft )  in which 97.8% of patients had a df threshold 20 j. following the system revisions  all patients passed the test successfully  but with a significantly higher energy level than for those who did not require revision ( 22.2 j vs. 16.4 j  p < 0.001 ) . 
 this is in agreement with a canadian survey in which an insufficient safety margin with the initial system configuration could be improved in only 56% of patients . 
 while the device revisions provided no benefit to our patients during follow - up  they significantly increased the total procedure time by 30 min and the fluoroscopy exposure by 40% . 
 the mean number of shocks needed to find an acceptable safety margin was also increased more than four - fold . 
 however  in a trial with variable use of devices  the shock efficacy is similar to that observed in the nordic icd trial . 
 the observed lower rate of arrhythmic death for patients without df testing ( 0.2 vs. 0.9% ) corresponds to the sudden cardiac death rate reported in another trial ( 0.9 and 1.2% in patients without and with df testing ) during a similar follow - up period . because the simple trial did not use a specific model for multiple shock events in the same patient  
 the shock efficacy can only be compared at the level of raw shock efficacy . in the nordic icd and the simple trials  
 a higher raw shock efficacy was observed in the group without df vs. with df testing ( nordic icd : 93.6 vs. 85.3% and simple : 92.0 vs. 88.5% ) . on the other hand 
  the higher first shock energy we used ( 40 j vs. 31 j in simple ) was not associated with a higher fse irrespective of testing . 
 the high level of fse is consistent with the relatively low mean df energy ( 16.7 j ) during testing  with > 95% of the inducible patients undergoing successful testing without any system reconfiguration . 
 a 15.7% serious adverse events rate ( 17.6% with testing and 13.9% without testing  p = 0.095 ) was found within 30 days following successful icd implantation . 
 this is much higher than what has been described in recent reports  in which the complication rates ranged between 2.3 and 2.7% in patients with and without an adequate safety margins during df testing or compared with the simple trial results regarding adverse events included in the pre - defined as the primary safety outcome ( 5.6% without df testing vs. 6.5% with df testing ) . 
 it is noteworthy that the nordic icd trial not only collected data on protocol - specified complications but also on all procedure- and patient - related adverse events which might explain our higher event rate . 
 the 30-day procedure - related mortality rate was 0.2%  and consisted of two sudden deaths which is in the range of recent reports . 
 the stroke rate was 0.8% for patients without and 0.2% for patients with df testing ( p = 0.217 )  which is in agreement with the 0.4% rate reported in the credit registry . 
 the two types of adverse events that were increased in patients with df testing were intra - operative hypotension ( 1.7% vs. 0.0%  p = 0.004 ) and lead - related complications ( 3.9 vs. 2.8%  p = 0.311 ) . a recent article summarized implant - related complications that were directly or indirectly related to the df testing procedure . 
 the rate of haemodynamic complications was 1%  and lead dislodgement was listed as the most frequent single complication with rates between 1 and 6% . 
 both the nordic icd and simple trials showed a trend towards lower procedural complication rates in patients without df testing despite the different definitions and methods used for analysing these events ( nordic icd : 13.9 vs.17.6%  p = 0.095  simple : 5.6 vs. 6.5%  p = 0.33 ) . 
 the rates of all - cause  cardiac  and non - cardiac mortality were similar between patients with and without df testing  which is in agreement with most non - randomized trials reported . in accordance with the simple trial  no statistical difference in all - cause mortality between patients with and without df testing 
 however  the annual mortality rates of nordic icd were lower when compared with other large randomized icd trials  and also lower than those of the simple trial . 
 the nordic icd trial supports the hypothesis that if 40 j devices are used  df testing does not improve df efficacy during follow - up . 
 it suggests that df testing or the various measures to improve df efficacy lengthen the procedure  and may even be harmful . 
 the nordic icd trial is one of two large prospective randomized trials  which do not support the routine use of df testing during left - sided first time icd implantation .

1) Abstract: This study examined shock efficacy during follow-up in patients with first-time implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implants with or without defibrillation (DF) testing. Results showed that DF testing is not necessary for left-sided ICD implantation. 

2) Research and Discussion: The study included 1077 patients randomized to receive an ICD with or without DF testing. The primary endpoint was first shock efficacy for ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation episodes. Results showed no significant difference in efficacy between groups. Further, serious adverse events were higher in the DF testing group. 

3) Results and Conclusion: After a median follow-up of 22.8 months, first shock efficacy was found to be non-inferior in patients without DF testing. This suggests that DF testing during first-time ICD implantation is not necessary and may increase the risk of serious adverse events. Therefore, it should not be recommended for routine left-sided ICD implantation."
"bladder cancer is the seventh most common malignancy in the world in men and the third most common in poland . in women 
  this cancer occurs less frequently ( 17 in the world and 15 in poland )  but in contrast to men  an increasing trend of morbidity can be observed [ 15 ] . in poland in 2010  6296 incidents of bladder cancer were noticed ( 4919 men  1377 women ) . 
 mortality of this cancer is high  reaching 50.2% for men and 46.5% for women . 
 approximately 1520% of bladder cancers infiltrate the bladder muscle layer ; in such cases  the treatment of choice is radical cystectomy  which connects with the necessity of urine diversion after bladder removal . in 2010  1260 patients required urinary diversion . in europe  each year 140 000 new cases of bladder cancer are noticed  which gives 25 000 patients for urinary diversion . 
 urinary diversion can be divided into incontinent and continent ( formed orthotopically or non  orthotopically ) . 
 incontinent ileocutaneostomy is most commonly used among surgeons and this type of urinary diversion has the greatest chances to be constructed using tissue engineering methods . the use of an ileal segment  beside advantages such as maintaining ureter continuity together with urine outflow using autologous material with well developed blood supply  has number of disadvantages especially in the long  term follow  up [ 1012 ] . 
 this method is also associated with the necessity of additional surgical procedure conduction on the ileum . 
 the use of tissue engineering techniques gives opportunities to construct artificial conduits de novo in the laboratory without affecting the ileum . 
 the first attempt at incontinent urinary diversion was carried out in 1851 in london by john simon  who conducted two ureterosigmoidal fistulas using a specially designed silver catheter . 
 ernst kster performed the first time radical cystetctomy in a patient suffering from localized urinary bladder cancer . 
 robert coffey developed a new method of ureter implantation into the bowel wall which was used in clinical practice by charles mayo in 1912 ( coffey  mayo technique ) . 
 this method used a bowel submucosal tunnel which protects against urine outflow ( reflux ) . with some modifications  
 frank hinman and henry m. weyrauch analyzed 740 urinary diversion procedures performed using 60 different methods . 
 the most effective incontinent urinary diversion method with the highest survival rate in these years was cuteneous ureterostomy . 
 the first attempt at a unilateral cuteneous ureterostomy was performed in 1889 by jean f. a. le dentu . in 1892  ludwik rydygier performed the first bilateral cuteneous ureterostomy . in 1905  rowsing modified rydygier 's technique by constructing a nipple after ureter exteriorization  over which a sliver urine reservoir was placed . 
 other incontinent urinary diversion techniques included ureter anastomosis with the urethral groove ( eduard sonnenburg 1881 ) or ureter implantation into the vagina ( karl pawlick 1888 ) . 
 the use of an ileal segment as a conduit for urine diversion was performed for the first time in 1911 by zaayer on two patients . 
 the first patient died because of cancer and the second because of peritonitis . in 1950  eugene m. bricker presented 307 incontinent urinary diversion procedures using an ileal segment reaching 12.4% mortality ; only 3.4% directly involved urinary diversion . 
 this method was considered a gold standard for 35 years and with some modification is used even now . over the past 65 years 
 the first attempt at artificial urinary conduit construction using tissue engineering methods was performed by drewa in 2007 . in this experiment  
 small intestine submucosa ( sis )  acellular or seeded  with 3t3 fibroblast cell line was used on rat models . 
 the experiment was performed on 6 animals ; patent conduits were observed in three rats at the end of follow  up . 
 no differences in cell layer regeneration were observed in seeded and unseeded groups . additionally  acellular matrices induced less severe inflammatory responses . 
 five years later  two other groups conducted urinary conduit construction on a porcine model . 
 animals were divided into 2 groups : acellular matrices ( n = 4 ) and matrices seeded with urothelial cells ( n = 6 ) . 
 patent urostomy was obtained in 5 animals  with no differences between seeded and unseeded matrices . 
 they used polyglicolic acid coated with poly(lactide  co  glicolide ) scaffold ( pga / plga ) unseeded or seeded with smooth muscle cells derived from different origin ( bladder  adipose tissue  blood ) . 
 in contrast to previously presented experiments  in this study  the bladder was removed and both ureters were transplanted to the conduit . obtained results showed that the use of smooth muscle cells from different origins led to regeneration of a neo  organ resembling native bladder tissue composed of urothelium and smooth muscle layers . 
 the use of acellular scaffold resulted in fibrous connective tissue development with a small number of smooth muscle cells . 
 acellular matrices were used in 6 animals and scaffolds seeded with urothelial cells were used in 24 rabbits . in this study  the bladder was also removed and both ureters were transplanted to the conduit . in the group where matrices were seeded  
 up  conduit lumen was covered with multilayer urothelium and no severe complications were observed . in the unseeded group  
 4 animals died one month before the end of follow  up and the two remaining animals had fistulas and lack of urothelium regeneration . 
 scaffold seeded with urothelial cells was protected against scar and kidney stone formation  atresia and hydronephrosis . in our study 
  we compared two acellular matrices form different origins : autologous naturally derived acellular aortic arch and synthetic policaprolactone ( plcl ) produced using the electrospining method . 
 the experiment was conducted on 12 wistar rats divided into 2 equal groups  six rats for each tested scaffold . 
 obtained results indicated that acellular aortic arch is an unsuitable scaffold for urinary conduit construction in a rat model . in all animals with acellular aortic arch conduit  
 in which plcl scaffold was used in 3 cases  constructed conduits were patent at the end of follow  up ( 4 weeks )  but only in one case intense urine flow  without the presence of pus in the urinary tract  was observed . 
 autologous acellular aortic arch  despite easy accessibility and proper extracellular matrix composition  is unsuitable for urinary conduit construction because of its small diameter and too elastic structure  which leads to atresion about one week after the surgical procedure . 
 plcl is more rigid and its diameter can be regulated during the electrospining method  which is why better results were obtained using this scaffold . 
 unsatisfactory results with plcl were probably caused by open urinary tract during follow  up  as use of urostomy bags on rat models is impossible . 
 such complications were not observed when a ureter segment was regenerated using this same scaffolds . 
 use of plcl resulted in ureter segment reconstruction in 4 cases ( n = 6 )  which was confirmed by urography . in that group  
 all currently performed attempts of experimental artificial urinary conduit construction using tissue engineering techniques are presented in figure 1 .

 caprolactone ) ; pga / plga  polyglicolic acid coated with poly ( lactide  co  glicolide ) scaffold ; sis  small intestine submucosa ; bam  bladder acellular matrix . in literature 
 there is still a small number of works describing the use of tissue engineering for urinary conduit construction . in the paper by sloff et al . 
  all experiments describing the use of tissue engineering in urinary diversion construction conducted so far were evaluated . 
 they analyzed 8 works  of which 5 were related to urinary conduit and 3 to neo  bladder construction . 
 this shows how little is known about ureter segment regeneration including artificial urinary conduit construction  which continues to be an unresolved problem . 
 synthetic polymers have promising properties because these materials can be produced de novo and different shapes  porosity and degradation time can be obtained . the best solution for 
 a patient would be the use of an acellular scaffold without the necessity of cell seeding . 
 such an approach will eliminate invasive collection of tissue for cell isolation and long in vitro culture ( about 2 weeks ) . 
 construction of an artificial urinary conduit without cell seeding makes it the ideal off  the  shelf product which could be purchased from the pharmacy directly before the surgical procedure . 
 scaffold which protects seeded cells from the toxic influence of urine is an important issue . in an in vitro culture study  
 urine acted as a cytotoxic agent against urothelial cells and bone  marrow mesenchymal stem cells [ 26  27 ] . 
 urothelial cells build the inner layer of the ureter  protecting against urine components reabsorption . 
 urothelium can self  regenerate on a scaffold surface after transplantation by migration from surrounding tissue [ 2830 ] . 
 epithelial regeneration should be potentially easier in the case of ureter segment regeneration in which urothelial cells can migrate from two edges  compared to urinary conduit . 
 data available in literature gives contrary results about the use of urothelial cells in tissue engineering applications . 
 some studies showed no differences in seeded and unseeded group ; on the other hand  other researches obtained positive results only when scaffold was seeded with urothelial cells [ 22  23 ] . 
 they concluded that after 4 week follow up  the epithelial layer regenerated only on 0.5 cm scaffold  which is not a clinically important segment . on longer scaffolds  
 regeneration was observed only at the anastomotic edges with dense fibrosis throughout the grafts . in previous experiments  
 only one scaffold type was analyzed . in our work  we compared two scaffold types : natural and synthetic . 
 obtained results showed better regeneration of urothelium on synthetic biodegradable polymer compared to natural derived acellular blood vessel matrix . 
 it should be noted that material for artificial urinary conduit construction should be produced from components that will protect from fibrosis and calcification of urine substrates on the scaffold surface . 
 the crucial point is regeneration of the smooth muscle layer and restoration of peristaltic waves on the reconstructed segment . 
 the urinary conduit must be constructed from rigid material in order to protect from scaffold occlusion at the site of anastomosis with skin . 
 such properties can result in peristaltic wave arrest at the site of ureter anastomosis with scaffold  which can lead to urine reflux and development of hydronephrosis . 
 quick regeneration of smooth muscle layer should prevent the development of the side effects mentioned above . despite the fact that acellular scaffold might be the best solution 
  some papers indicate that scaffold pre  seeded with cells ( autologous form bladder biopsy or mesenchymal stem cells from different origin ) showed better smooth muscle layer regeneration compared to unseeded controls . 
 the best type of cells seems to be mesenchymal stem cells from fat tissue or bone marrow and from promising sources like amniotic fluid or hair follicles [ 13  33 ] . 
 use of differentiated autologous cells from bladder biopsy is limited due to the risk of cancer development in the case of bladder cancer patients  who are the main candidates for urinary conduit construction . 
 the number of cells seeded on scaffold is also very important and the conception seems to be simple : the more cells on cm of scaffold  the better the results that can be achieved . 
 the achievement of such large cell numbers is challenging issue because the average bladder cancer patient is 65 years old and mesenchymal stem cells proliferation capacity decreases with the age of the patient and with increasing passage numbers [ 36  37 ] . on the other hand 
  some authors suggested that stem cell proliferation capacity is not dependent on the donors age  which increase the chances of tissue engineering therapy use in artificial urinary conduit construction . despite that  such a large number of cells necessary for regeneration is hard to obtain and very costly because of the price of culture media containing appropriate growth factors . 
 that is why an efficient cell culture method has to be developed to provide success of this procedure . for many years  atypical 
 smooth muscle cells ( asmcs ) localized in proximal regions of the renal pelvis were considered a peacemaker of peristaltic waves responsible for urine passage into the bladder . 
 recent studies indicated that interstitial cells of cajal like cells ( icc  lc ) expressing the c  kit gene  which are sparsely distributed within the lamina propria and muscle layer of upper urinary tract  play an important role in promoting pyeloureteric peristalsis . 
 contraction waves generated in the renal pelvis are probably propagated  coordinated and modulated in the upper urinary tract by icc  lc [ 41  42 ] . 
 iccs  thanks to their automatism  are able to replace discontinued atypical smcs impulses and maintain peristaltis of lower ureter parts [ 40  43 ] . in vitro isolation and culture of icc  lc from the urinary tract has not yet been established  but taking into consideration previous works and our experience on urinary conduit construction  addition of these cells or coculture of them with smooth muscle cells can potentially accelerate the restoration of peristaltic waves on the reconstructed segment  which could prevent development of hydronephrosis . 
 the first attempt at incontinent urinary diversion was carried out in 1851 in london by john simon  who conducted two ureterosigmoidal fistulas using a specially designed silver catheter . 
 the patient died one year after the procedure due to peritonitis . in 1891  ernst kster performed the first time radical cystetctomy in a patient suffering from localized urinary bladder cancer . 
 robert coffey developed a new method of ureter implantation into the bowel wall which was used in clinical practice by charles mayo in 1912 ( coffey  mayo technique ) . 
 this method used a bowel submucosal tunnel which protects against urine outflow ( reflux ) . with some modifications  
 frank hinman and henry m. weyrauch analyzed 740 urinary diversion procedures performed using 60 different methods . 
 the most effective incontinent urinary diversion method with the highest survival rate in these years was cuteneous ureterostomy . 
 the first attempt at a unilateral cuteneous ureterostomy was performed in 1889 by jean f. a. le dentu . in 1892  ludwik rydygier performed the first bilateral cuteneous ureterostomy . in 1905  rowsing modified rydygier 's technique by constructing a nipple after ureter exteriorization  over which a sliver urine reservoir was placed . 
 other incontinent urinary diversion techniques included ureter anastomosis with the urethral groove ( eduard sonnenburg 1881 ) or ureter implantation into the vagina ( karl pawlick 1888 ) . 
 the use of an ileal segment as a conduit for urine diversion was performed for the first time in 1911 by zaayer on two patients . 
 the first patient died because of cancer and the second because of peritonitis . in 1950  eugene m. bricker presented 307 incontinent urinary diversion procedures using an ileal segment reaching 12.4% mortality ; only 3.4% directly involved urinary diversion . 
 this method was considered a gold standard for 35 years and with some modification is used even now . over the past 65 years  a more effective method of incontinent urinary diversion was not developed . 
 the first attempt at artificial urinary conduit construction using tissue engineering methods was performed by drewa in 2007 . in this experiment  
 small intestine submucosa ( sis )  acellular or seeded  with 3t3 fibroblast cell line was used on rat models . 
 the experiment was performed on 6 animals ; patent conduits were observed in three rats at the end of follow  up . 
 five years later  two other groups conducted urinary conduit construction on a porcine model . 
 animals were divided into 2 groups : acellular matrices ( n = 4 ) and matrices seeded with urothelial cells ( n = 6 ) . 
 patent urostomy was obtained in 5 animals  with no differences between seeded and unseeded matrices . 
 they used polyglicolic acid coated with poly(lactide  co  glicolide ) scaffold ( pga / plga ) unseeded or seeded with smooth muscle cells derived from different origin ( bladder  adipose tissue  blood ) . 
 in contrast to previously presented experiments  in this study  the bladder was removed and both ureters were transplanted to the conduit . obtained results showed that the use of smooth muscle cells from different origins led to regeneration of a neo  organ resembling native bladder tissue composed of urothelium and smooth muscle layers .

 in conclusion  success in ureter conduit construction using tissue engineering techniques depends on finding the proper scaffold . 
 we believe that implementation of this procedure is possible and urinary conduit should be the first commercially available product in clinical practice constructed using regenerative medicine . 
 confirmation of this opinion is registered in a clinicaltrial.gov study about incontinent urinary conduit construction using pga / plga scaffold seeded with autologous smooth muscle cells derived from adipose tissue biopsy .","

1) Abstract: This review analyzes the use of incontinent urinary diversion and explores the potential of using regenerative medicine and tissue engineering techniques for artificial urinary conduit construction.
2) Research and Discussion: The history of urinary diversion and current attempts at tissue engineered urinary conduits are discussed. Three main factors necessary for successful construction are outlined.
3) Results and Conclusion: Limited research in this field highlights the need for further attention. With proper scaffold construction and regeneration of urothelial and smooth muscle layers, artificial urinary conduits have potential to become a commercially available product in urology."
"renal replacement treatment  in the form of kidney transplantation or dialysis  is a life - supporting therapy for patients with end - stage renal disease . at the end of 2010  
 ~1.81 million chronic kidney disease patients globally were undergoing hemodialysis ( hd ) treatment  with an estimated 90000 ( 5% ) thereof being treated with hemodiafiltration ( hdf).1 online hdf has been suggested as a possible cost - effective alternative compared to standard hd  mainly due to its superior middle molecule clearance resulting from the combination of diffusion and convection solute removal mechanisms . 
 several studies suggest that hdf may lead to better clinical results than high - flux hd ( hf - hd).23 according to a recent survey  hdf was started to prevent dialysis complications  increase the efficiency of dialysis for uremic accumulates  treat dialysis - related hypotension and dialysis - related amyloidosis  and for intractable pruritus  restless leg syndrome and arthralgia not related to dialysis - related amyloidosis.4 however  to date  randomized studies have not conclusively supported the superiority of hdf regarding clinical outcomes.57 in addition  concerns have been raised about its cost - utility8 leading investigators to conduct cost analyses to assess the differential expenditures between the two therapies.9 in a recent editorial  vanholder et al concluded that more expensive therapies should be reimbursed only when evidence of their cost - utility  defined as the ratio of treatment cost to treatment outcome  taking into consideration also the quality of life ( qol )  is sufficiently robust.10 the cost of hdf per se has decreased in recent years due to 1 ) increased market penetration and the subsequent economy of scale in the production of equipment and disposables  2 ) the pressure on health care costs due to the economic crises prevailing since 2008  and 3 ) the safety and reliability of online method that have reduced demand for microbiological testing and monitoring.1112 furthermore  after the publication of the study of canaud et al2 hdf treatment effectiveness has increasingly been understood to be positively associated with the magnitude of the convection volume used  resulting in trends toward the application of higher hdf convection volumes than were applied in earlier cost analyses . accordingly  there is a need for a new cost - effectiveness evaluation . the aim of this study is to assess the cost - effectiveness of hdf compared to hd by a simulation using existing study data . 
 these data facilitate an understanding of whether longer survival and better health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) are able to offset the possibly higher costs of hdf  and thus whether it is worth investing in this more innovative therapy . 
 the analysis comprised a simulation1315 based on results from combined previous observational studies  randomized clinical trials  and a meta - analysis with the following steps : 1 ) estimation of a ) the survival function of hf - hd patients from the membrane permeability outcome study16 dataset and b ) estimation of the survival function of hdf patients using the risk reduction estimates due to the treatment effect from the meta - analysis of mostovaya et al17 ( even though it includes also studies comparing hdf to low - flux hd  it was considered the best proxy with respect to other alternative meta - analyses available in the literature ) ; 2 ) simulation of the survival of the same sample of patients as if allocated to hf - hd or hdf using three - state markov models ; 3 ) application of state - specific hrqol coefficients and differential costs ( materials  testing  and consumption of water ) derived from the literature . 
 in addition  in a secondary subgroup analysis we considered the eshol5 estimations related to diabetics and nondiabetics . 
 this was done because among all the studies considered the eshol study provides results related to these particular subgroups of patients . 
 two mirror - image markov models ( figure 1 ) were developed with the aim to generate a simulation comparing the survival of the same sample of patients treated with hf - hd and hdf . 
 three possible states were considered : alive and under therapy  dead due to the disease under therapy  and dead for other cause ( ie  considering the overall mortality  based on age- and sex - adjusted life tables ) . 
 the probabilities defining the transition of patients between each of these states were calculated from the previously estimated hazard functions and were specified over a defined time frame ( cycle ) . 
 the model was run for a specified number of cycles to see how the hypothetical cohort of patients moved between states . 
 the length of the cycle was fixed to 1 year and the number of cycles to ten  for a total of 10 years . 
 accordingly  total dialysis costs can be divided into : 1 ) direct health care costs  such as staff  material  vascular access  routine diagnostics  hospitalization  drugs  and medications ; 2 ) direct nonhealth care costs  such as cost of transport and cost of informal care ; and 3 ) indirect nonhealth care costs  productivity losses due to disability or premature death . 
 it is reasonable to assume that direct nonhealth care costs and indirect nonhealth care costs are the same for the two therapies  and also that most of the direct health care costs do not vary by treatment . as a consequence  
 the comparison on the incremental costs of hdf with respect to hf - hd focused only on the costs of equipment  disposables  ultrapure water testing  and water consumption.18 in order to obtain more generalizable results  we analyzed two alternative cost settings  involving or not involving the use of ultrapure water . 
 the first was based on the assumption that  since dialyzers used to perform both hdf and hf - hd are designed to have better solute clearances on a wider range of uremic toxins and higher hydraulic permeability  it is reasonable to argue that the same water and dialysis fluid microbiological purity were necessary for both therapies due to backfiltration phenomena  leading to similar costs of water testing . as a consequence  and because differences in total water consumption are negligible  it was possible to limit the analysis to the costs of disposables ( blood lines  dialyzers ) and equipment only . 
 in the prospective observational study by oates et al9 some patients on hf - hd were switched to hdf and others remained on hf - hd . 
 the additional cost of disposables related to hdf was of  1.32 per session (  207 per annum [ p.a . ] ) in the standard case  that is  with the use of a cuvette for relative blood volume monitoring . 
 the alternative cost setting was based on the analysis by lebourg et al12 where  in addition to a cost variability due to disposables and monitors  the difference in cost between the two different therapies caused by water analysis and water consumption was considered . 
 the additional hdf cost per session ranged from a minimum value of 1.29 ( 202 p.a . ) to a maximum value of  4.86 (  730 p.a . ) . 
 once the relevant costs were determined  the corresponding estimated and discounted costs ( or a differential cost ) taken from the literature were allocated to each state of the model . 
 contradicting results have been reported on the difference in qol related to hf - hd and hdf . 
 few studies addressed the qol evaluation  and none provided hrqol coefficients for the specific comparison of hf - hd and hdf  fundamental for the purpose of this analysis . 
 mazairac et al8 estimated higher scores with euroqol 5d for patients on hdf compared with hd . 
 this preference - based measure yields a set of weights on which quality - adjusted life years ( qalys ) calculations can be based . in this study 
 as there are no other data about qol differences between hdf and hf - hd in the literature  these coefficients have been used in our simulation . in particular  the hrqol coefficients linked to age were selected for the model because otherwise a fundamental component of the benefit measurement would have been neglected . as recommended by the economic analysis guidelines19 an annual discount rate of 3.5% for both costs and benefits was selected  and changes in results as a function of different values of these parameters were considered . 
 parameter uncertainty was included in the model through a probabilistic sensitivity analysis  taking the intrinsic imprecision of the estimate of the parameters of the survival model into account . 
 consequently  the quality and quantity of information available can be reflected in the probability distributions assigned to each input parameter in the model.20 several monte carlo simulations were performed  also for patients with different risk profiles by age ( patients aged 40  50  and 60 years )  sex  and diabetic status.2122 for the sake of simplicity  the cohort of simulated 50-year - old male patients were selected as the reference population for the analysis . as discussed in the next section  we found similar results in all age subgroups  with identical conclusions in terms of cost - effectiveness ; therefore  we used this cohort to briefly recap the main results of our analysis . 
 the characteristics of this cohort are coherent with the results from the edta registry reported by van de luijtgaarden et al:23 in the last 20 years indeed the mean age of patients who started with hd treatment was 5560 years  and on average > 60% of patients were male . 
 output analyses included scatter plots of simulations in the cost - effectiveness plane  the estimation of incremental cost - effectiveness ratios ( icers ) and the computation of cost - effectiveness acceptability curves ( ceacs ) . 
 the results of the 1000 monte carlo simulations for the cohort of 50-year - old male patients are shown in the cost - effectiveness scatter plot in figure 2 . from the mean values of all the simulations in this specific cohort of patients  
 the icer was  6982/qaly . on the basis of these simulations it was possible to derive the probability of cost - effectiveness given different thresholds  as shown in figure 3 . 
 the ceac corresponding to hdf starts from 0  meaning that there is no possibility that this alternative therapy is cost - saving 
 . the threshold must be at least  2000 per qaly to have a probability of cost - effectiveness > 0 . 
 the probability of cost - effectiveness increased to 50% with a threshold of  7000/qaly  to 70% with a threshold of  15000/qaly and to 81% with the commonly accepted threshold of  40000/qaly . 
 the probability of cost - effectiveness always stayed below 84% for a threshold of over  40000/qaly . 
 this asymptotic value results from the fact that a fraction of the simulations represent cases where the alternative therapy ( hdf ) causes higher costs and provided fewer benefits . 
 this means that even with any budget constraint  there is some probability that the alternative therapy is not cost - effective and the traditional one ( hf - hd ) is preferred . the same analyses were carried out for the subgroups of 40-  50-  and 60-year - old male and female patients ( table 1 ) : hdf appears to be more cost - effective for younger patients . 
 this message is reinforced in figure 4  which shows that a given threshold value is associated to a higher probability of hdf being cost - effective for the 40- and 50-year - old patients than for the 60-year - old ones . 
 moreover  for the 60-year - old groups there is a probability of around 28% for both females and males that hdf is not cost - effective even at extreme values of the threshold . regarding the discount rates for costs and benefits  results were robust even after considering alternative scenarios with lower or higher discount rates . 
 by applying a 0% or a 5% discount rate for both costs and effects  50-year - old male patient icer decreased to  6676/qaly and increased to  6960/qaly  respectively  confirming the robustness of the estimations . 
 a further analysis was performed to investigate the importance of the qualitative component of the qalys ( qol ) compared to the quantitative one ( life years ) . 
 the effect of using overall hrqol coefficients ( rather than the hrqol coefficients linked to patient age ) on the cohort of 50-year - old male patients is shown in figure 5 . 
 the mean icer increased to  19423/qaly but  more importantly  almost 37% of the simulations were on the left of the qaly zero value ( less effectiveness  more costs ) and  accordingly  the uncertainty around the decision whether to invest in the new therapy was much higher . 
 even an infinite value of the threshold would not lead to a probability of cost - effectiveness > 65% ( data not shown ) . 
 this is caused by the uncertain values of the overall hrqol coefficients  leading to some cases where one period spent under hf - hd is worth even more than the same period under hdf . 
 this shows that it is crucial to consider the role of qol is in such evaluations . 
 previously  cost inputs were point estimates  whereas now costs vary over the range assessed by lebourg et al.12 the ceac for the subgroup of 50-year - old male patients shows that 21.5% of the simulations are cost - saving ( figure 6 ) . 
 the probability of being cost - effective reaches 80% at the commonly accepted threshold of  40000/qaly  and it increases only by 2.4 percentage points even with a threshold of  70000/qaly . 
  hdf seems a little more expensive : for instance  the icers of the younger patients rise from  5878/qaly and  5732/qaly to  7748/qaly and  7724/qaly for female and male patients  respectively ( table 2 ) . 
 this subgroup analysis confirmed the previous results : the icer increases with the age of the cohort . 
 diabetic patients follow a different survival function and are subject to a different treatment effects of the alternative therapy compared to nondiabetic patients . 
 nevertheless  the comparison between a cohort of 50-year - old diabetic male patients and a cohort of 50-year - old nondiabetic male patients did not reveal significant differences ( figure 7 ) . 
 given the commonly accepted threshold of  40000/qaly  this study demonstrated that  compared to hf - hd  hdf is a cost - effective treatment for patients on dialysis . 
 this is particularly true for patients < 60 years  irrespective of sex or diabetic status . 
 either way  the variability in the results due to different characteristics of the patients does not affect the conclusions about the cost - effectiveness of hdf . 
 these results are quite different from those reported by mazairac et al8 in their cost - utility analysis of hdf versus conventional low - flux hd based on the unadjusted results for convective volume of the convective transport study ( contrast).7 their estimated incremental cost per quality - adjusted life year of hdf compared to low - flux hd was  287679 and certainly not below  140000 under the most favorable assumptions ( eg  applying a convection volume > 20.3 l ) . 
 they argued that the hdf is characterized by higher cost and better health and was not cost - effective given the currently accepted cost - utility thresholds . 
 however  it has to be mentioned that the same analysis performed on patients treated in montreal ( canada ) according to the same protocol yielded different  positive  results.24 our analysis  on the other hand  reports that hdf is cost - effective with a probability of ~81% . 
 this conclusion is based on what is considered the commonly accepted threshold for health policy decisions25 which is ~40000 ( or 30000 gbp  or 50000 usd ) per qaly . even if this threshold is difficult to quantify and 
 is often based on a rule of thumb  it is commonly applied as an estimate of the forgone health resulting from services displaced to accommodate the additional costs of the new technology . of note 
  the magnitude of the difference between the two studies may be related to the different comparison groups  which is low - flux hd in the contrast study and hf - hd in our model . 
 the icer estimates show a good value for money  but some doubts about the cost - effectiveness of hdf over hf - hd remain due to the residual ~20% probability of costs being higher and/or benefits being lower with hdf . 
 this line of reasoning is also shared by mcbrien and manns26 in their commentary of the mazairac study  where they argued that hdf is characterized by higher procedural costs and has no proven health benefit . 
 our study specifies that the survival difference is not the only important factor ( especially considering the lack of agreement on this aspect )  but that differences in terms of qol are of fundamental importance and must be measured . 
 this was the rationale for conducting a value - based study incorporating hrqol as a main outcome of hdf versus hf - hd . 
 convective treatments as hdf indeed reduce intradialytic hypotension ( which affects qol )  and possibly limit the poor appetite and nutritional state in patients with chronic kidney disease . 
 however  we believe that more research is warranted to assess the impact of hdf specifically on the nutritional state of end - stage renal disease patients 
 . therefore  this study recommends prioritizing the research which evaluates the qol related to hdf . 
 it must be stressed that the purpose itself of an economic decision model is to synthesize all the relevant evidence in order to make a sense of it and inform the decision about the adoption of a new technology in an uncertain context.15 we have indeed identified the relevant studies involving the therapies under assessment  and we have included all the uncertainty in our parameter estimates  without neglecting any relevant information in the literature . 
 our result is therefore based on published data  but its accuracy is sensitive to some decisions that we were forced to take in the model construction phase . 
 the first decision was to use survival estimates from the hf - hd arm of the membrane permeability outcome16 randomized clinical trial . 
 this trial was based on incident patients  whereas other studies on hdf were mainly performed on prevalent european dialysis patients . 
 additionally  the low crude mortality rate observed in the membrane permeability outcome study may produce results not completely transferrable to ordinary ( nontrial participating ) patients . 
 indeed  as stressed by palmer et al20 relative risk reductions applied to low baseline risks produce low absolute reduction in event rates and low gains in health . 
 it is possible that this low overall mortality rate affected the lack of difference between diabetic and nondiabetic patients . 
 as previously stressed  one of the main requirements for an economic evaluation is to include all the relevant evidence . with regard to the effectiveness data  this concept does not change  and meta - analysis 
 is the usual technique employed to synthesize all the available evidence . to date five meta - analyses aggregating the results of the main convective dialysis therapy studies172730 
 have been published . however  a huge heterogeneity of interventions was included in these meta - analyses  and the meta - analysis by mostovaya et al17 was the only one which focused on trials on hdf as convective therapy with appropriate definition of convective volume . 
 nevertheless  there is still a great variety of patients and treatment modalities characteristics among the studies . 
 indeed  for instance  both high- and low - flux modalities were included in the comparison . as a consequence  
 a relative risk based on a random effects model has been used  which makes the estimate of the pooled effect more conservative  and takes into account the clinical heterogeneity among the single studies . of note 
  this meta - analysis includes also the contrast study  and our cost - effectiveness analysis does include all the relevant randomized clinical trials . on the contrary  for instance 
  the economic evaluation by mazairac is based only on the contrast study ; this is a subjective decision  while a complete cost - effectiveness analysis should instead take into consideration all the relevant available evidence  as previously pointed out . with regard to the subanalysis of the diabetic patients  the eshol5 estimates of risk reduction have been used . 
 as the eshol study provided the most positive results in favor of hdf  concerns about the overestimation of the reduction in mortality could be raised . 
 nevertheless  the model did not show any difference between the two groups of patients  and this result highlights again that the impact on mortality is less important than the effect on the qol . 
 the estimations used for this study were mainly derived from a meta - analysis with basically 23 years follow - up time  but a more appropriate time horizon would be the patient s lifetime . this is especially true in the case of treatment of chronic diseases where the initiation of an intervention in middle - aged patients may have cost and effect implications on the rest of their lives.31 an important role of a decision model  therefore  is to bridge the gap between what has been observed in trials and what would be expected to happen over the long - term  forcing one to make assumptions about the long - term effects and consequences of treatment modalities . 
 additionally  the lack of qol coefficients related to hf - hd forced the use of data from a comparison of hdf with low - flux hd.8 
 uncertainty around results is high  but this is typical in this kind of analyses : neglecting some available evidence only because of its uncertainty would contrast with the comprehensive nature of an economic model . 
 this study contributes also to show the scarcity and heterogeneity of data available in the literature that jeopardize the economic evaluation of hdf when compared to hf - hd . 
 new studies are needed to assess more precisely the differential benefits between the therapies : value - of - information analysis might help to identify more specifically the parameters which would be worth to be further investigated . 
 a more comprehensive evaluation performed in a randomized clinical trial is required in order to include other relevant cost components ( eg  pharmaceuticals  hospitalizations  prevention of long - term dialysis - related complications  beta-2 microglobulin - amyloidosis  and transplantation access ) in the analysis . 
 possible savings resulting from a reduction in the cost of ancillary pharmacological therapy and hospitalization have not been considered in the current analysis .","

Abstract: This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of hemodiafiltration (HDF) compared to high-flux hemodialysis (HF-HD) for patients with end-stage renal disease. Results show that HDF is cost-effective in terms of quality-adjusted life years.

Research and Discussion: By simulating patient survival and including health-related quality of life coefficients, this study found that HDF may provide better clinical outcomes than HF-HD at a higher cost. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a high likelihood that HDF is cost-effective compared to HF-HD.

Results and Conclusion: The study suggests that HDF can be considered a cost-effective treatment option for patients with end-stage renal disease, especially for younger patients. However, further research is needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness and cost implications of HDF."
"alzheimer s disease ( ad ) is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease ( ferri et al .  2005 ) and is characterized by a progressive dementia that occurs in middle or late life . 
 the neuropathological hallmark of ad is the presence of cortical intracellular neurofibrillary tangles ( nft ) and extracellular -amyloid ( a ) plaques ( braak and braak  1991 )  which leads to synapse dysfunction  neuronal cell loss and subsequent brain atrophy ( ballard et al .  2011 ) . 
 in the past few decades the knowledge of the key pathogenic mechanisms of the disease has improved  but they are still not completely understood ( querfurth and laferla  2010 ) . the natural history of ad could be divided in three different phases : the pre - clinical phase  where the pathogenic mechanisms of the disease have started but no symptoms can be identified ; the prodromal phase  where mild cognitive symptoms appear  but there are not severe enough to meet dementia criteria ; and the dementia phase ( dubois et al .  2007 ) . on the other hand  mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) is a clinical construct created to capture patients with subtle cognitive symptoms at risk for ad ( petersen et al .  2009 ) . 
 however  some subjects develop other types of dementias  do not progress  or even revert to normal cognition ( ganguli et al .  2004 ; brooks and loewenstein  2010 ) . 
 therefore  it is difficult to label mci patients as having prodromal ad . currently  the most frequently used clinical diagnostic criteria for ad are the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm - iv - tr ; apa  2000 ) and the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke - alzheimer disease and related disorders ( nincds  adrda ; mckhann et al .  1984 ) working group . 
 first  the dementia syndrome is established and then  criteria based on the clinical features of the ad type dementia are applied . 
 the dsm - iv - tr criteria require the presence of impairment in multiple cognitive domains of sufficient severity to interfere with the individuals activities of daily living to diagnose dementia . 
 hence  the clinical diagnosis of ad is not possible until a patient reach the dementia phase of the disease . on the other hand  
 these criteria have shown to have good sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between patients with ad type dementia and non - demented subjects  but are less accurate to differentiate ad dementia from other primary dementias ( knopman et al . 
 in fact  up to 20% of patients clinically diagnosed with ad do not have ad pathology at autopsy ( mayeux et al . 
 a more accurate and earlier diagnosis of ad ( e.g.  in mci patients that will progress to the ad dementia phase or ideally those subjects in the pre - clinical phase ) could enable the administration of potential disease - modifying drugs that would have a great impact on patients life and profound implications for public health ( brookmeyer et al . 
  1998 ) . in this context  there is a need of specific biological markers for ad diagnosis in the earliest stages . 
 a biomarker is defined as a measureable feature that can be used to diagnose a physiologic or pathologic condition . 
 the ideal biomarker of ad would be : ( 1 ) directed at the fundamental pathophysiology of the disease  ( 2 ) a marker of the presence of disease itself  ( 3 ) efficacious at prodromal  and even pre - clinical stages of ad  ( 4 ) an indicator of disease s severity  ( 5 ) a marker of treatment effectiveness  and ( 6 ) inexpensive and non - invasive ( klunk  1998 ) . in the case of ad  different biomarkers have been described using diverse approaches . 
 the development of cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) assays and neuroimaging techniques that can provide information about the presence of ad pathological changes has been a major step forward in the field . 
 consequently  biomarkers for ad are called to play a central role in the clinical characterization of the disease . more recently  the nincds  adrda criteria have been revised by the national institute on aging and the alzheimer s association ( nia  aa ) workgroup to include the experience in research over the past 25  years ( mckhann et al .  2011 ) . 
 the nia  aa proposed a series of diagnostic classification from pre - clinical ad to mci to full - blown ad  and introduced csf and neuroimaging biomarkers as supportive features of the disease ( albert et al . 
  2011 ; mckhann et al .  2011 ; sperling et al .  2011 ) . 
 however  the authors cautioned about the use of biomarkers  and stated that their use should be limited to research and drug trials . 
 nevertheless  the core clinical criteria for ad remained relatively intact in the new criteria . 
 this review will focus on the most widely studied and currently accepted sources of biomarkers in ad : csf  magnetic resonance imaging ( mri )  and nuclear medicine techniques  including amyloid imaging . 
 typically  the csf better reflects the brain neurochemistry  while biochemical values in plasma or serum may be affected by many non - neurological factors . 
 csf biomarker research has focused mainly on molecules related to the central neuropathological features of ad  such as a  the main component of the senile neuritic plaques ( snp )  and tau proteins that are part of the nfts . 
 a is a 3643 amino acid peptide originated from proteolysis of the amyloid protein precursor ( querfurth and laferla  2010 ) . 
 snps are mainly composed by a protein with 40 ( a40 ) or 42 ( a42 ) amino acids  and it seems that a deposition begins with a42  and during plaque maturation  they acquire a40 ( iwatsubo et al .  1994 ) . 
 by contrast  nfts are formed by tau proteins  a microtubule - associated stabilizing protein essential for axonal transport . 
 tau is hyperphosphorylated in ad  which tends to aggregate  leading to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction ( lee  1996 ; blennow et al .  2010 ; 
 this process of nfts formation starts in the entorhinal cortex  spreading to the hippocampus  and then to the rest of the brain . 
 these neuropathological changes begin early  even decades before the onset of clinical symptoms of dementia ( braak and braak  1991 )  but the relative contributions of altered tau and amyloid metabolism to neurodegeneration remain under investigation . 
 nevertheless  nfts are more robust associated with measures of synapse loss and cognitive impairment that snps ( gomez - isla et al .  1997 ) . 
 typically  ad patients have lower levels of a42 in the csf compared to normal controls  a40 tends to remain constant  and tau ( t - tau ) and phosphorylated tau ( p - tau ) increase ( arai et al .  1995 ; blennow et al .  1995 ; 
  1995 ; galasko et al .  1998 ; kurz et al .  1998 ; shoji et al .  1998 ; hulstaert et al .  1999 ; 
  2001 ; sunderland et al .  2003 ; lewczuk et al .  2004 ; 
 the low csf a42 levels in this entity may represent the retention of the peptide into plaques  resulting in reduced availability to diffuse into the csf . 
 this is supported by the findings that a42 in the csf is inversely correlated with amyloid plaque load at autopsy ( strozyk et al .  2003 ; tapiola et al .  
 2009 ) and as measured in vivo by amyloid imaging ( fagan et al .  2006 
 the increase in t - tau and p - tau in the csf of ad patients may stem from release into csf during neurodegeneration ( blennow et al .  1995 )  although the exact mechanism is not known . 
 t - tau and p - tau concentrations in the csf have been associated with nft load at autopsy ( buerger et al . 
 2009 )  as well as with cognitive decline and brain atrophy ( buerger et al .  2002 ; 
 low csf a42 and high t - tau or p - tau proteins have shown high accuracy for ad diagnosis ( galasko et al .  1998 ; andreasen et al .  2001 ; schoonenboom et al .  
 2004 ) . studies that compared ad patients with normal control subjects have demonstrated that low a42 had 78100% sensitivity and 4781% specificity for ad diagnosis ; high csf t - tau levels had 70% sensitivity and 92% specificity and p - tau showed 77% sensitivity and 87% specificity . 
 however  p - tau appears to be better than t - tau in the diagnosis of ad  and it has shown a positive predictive value of 90%  especially p - tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 ( p - tau181 ; hampel et al . 
 figure 1 shows the t - tau levels in ad  frontotemporal dementia ( ftd )  and normal autopsied subjects  and figure 2 shows the a42 levels in the same population ( schoonenboom et al .  
 ad  alzheimer s disease ; ftd  frontotemporal dementia . because some studies found that a42 and tau levels alone were not sufficient to differentiate ad from normal controls or other dementias  the a42/tau ratio is used to improve the diagnosis of ad . 
 a meta - analysis showed that the a42/tau ratio had a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 83% for ad ( hampel et al .  2004b ) ; and a recent study showed that the  signature  of ad  based on the csf a42/p - tau181 ratio cutoffs  was present in 90% of the ad patients compared to 36% in the normal control group ( de meyer et al .  2010 ) . 
 although  these csf biomarkers seem to be useful to diagnose ad  they are not sensitive enough to assess disease progression ( sunderland et al .  1999 ; vemuri et al .  2010b ) . 
 nevertheless  higher csf t - tau and lower a42 values have been associated with rapid cognitive decline  no response to cholinesterase inhibitor treatment and a higher mortality in patients with ad dementia ( wallin et al .  2010 ) . 
 cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers might have a role in the differential diagnosis of ad and other dementias . 
 patients with dementia with lewy bodies ( dlb )  like ad patients  have lower levels of a42 in the csf compared to normal controls  reflecting that most of these subjects also present ad pathology 
 . nevertheless  shorter amyloid peptides ( a37  a38  and a40 ) appear to be slightly more elevated in ad dementia ( bibl et al .  2006 ) . 
 consequently  the a42/a37 and a42/a38 ratios seemed to better discriminate ad from dlb ( bibl et al . 
 t - tau and p - tau levels are normal or high in dlb  but most studies have shown that these markers levels in dlb are definitely lower than those found in ad . 
 other proposed biomarker for the differentiation of ad from dlb was monomeric soluble -synuclein  but the available studies in dlb patients showed conflicting results . 
 elevated  unchanged and decreased total -synuclein levels have been reported in these patients compared to ad and control subjects ( mukaetova - ladinska et al .  2010 ) . 
 in addition  there are limited data about oligomeric -synuclein in csf  although it could be potential biomarker for synucleinopathies ( tokuda et al .  2010 ) . 
 possibly  the combination of all these markers will help to distinguish between ad and dlb in the future . in ftd  
 csf a42 levels are lower than in control subjects but higher than in ad  while t - tau and p - tau levels are higher than in controls but lower that in ad patients ( hulstaert et al . 
 hence  t - tau / a42 and p - tau / a42 ratios could be a useful tool to distinguish ad from ftd ( bian et al . 
 creutzfeldt  jakob disease ( cjd ) is characterized by decreased csf a42 concentrations and very high t - tau levels  reflecting intense neuronal damage  while p - tau levels are normal ( kapaki et al .  2001 ; 
 current data suggest that p - tau levels could be the most relevant marker to differentiate ad from other types of dementias ( hampel et al . 
 cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers may also be useful in predicting progression to ad in subjects with mci ( andreasen et al . 
  1999 ; hampel et al .  2004c ; ewers et al .  2007 
 low csf a42 levels predicted conversion with 6080% sensitivity and 65100% specificity  while t - tau levels had 8386% sensitivity and 5690% specificity  and p - tau had 7384% sensitivity and 4788% specificity ( hampel et al .  2004b ) . 
 however  the conversion to ad dementia in mci subjects has shown significant variability among different csf studies . 
 ( 2006 ) found high sensitivity ( 95% ) and specificity ( 87% ) for the conversion from mci to ad dementia using a combination of t - tau and a42/p - tau181 ratio cutoff values . 
 by contrast  a multicenter csf study found lower sensitivity ( 83% ) and specificity ( 72% ) for the conversion from mci to ad than single - site studies  with a considerable inter - site assay variability that highlights a need for standardization of analytical techniques and subject selection ( mattsson et al .  2009 ) . 
 other large multicenter studies have confirmed the high predictive value of these csf biomarkers in the identification of cases with prodromal ad in the context of the mci syndrome ( shaw et al .  2009 ; visser et al .  2009 ) . 
 the csf biomarkers have been used to identify the pre - clinical stage of ad . 
 cross - sectional studies in normal control individuals carrying the apoe4 allele showed lower csf a42 and higher p - tau181 levels ( peskind et al . 
 interestingly  csf levels of a42 correlated with brain volume in this group of subjects  while in mci and ad dementia patients  whole - brain volume correlated with csf t - tau and p - tau181 ( fagan et al .  2009 ) . 
 a longitudinal csf study in normal controls found increased t - tau levels and no change in a42 after a 1-year follow - up ( vemuri 
 a few longitudinal studies have assessed which csf biomarker or combination of biomarkers better predict ad dementia or cognitive decline . 
 fagan et al . ( 2007 ) demonstrated that csf tau / a42 ratios may predict future dementia in cognitively normal older subjects and two other studies showed that low levels of csf a42 predicted cognitive decline  as measured with the mini mental status examination ( mmse ; gustafson et al . 
 although there are studies that showed that csf a42 could predict prodromal ad  there was a wide sd in these subjects  which made difficult to determine individually who will progress to ad . 
 further studies are needed to assess changes in csf markers over time and to determine the best csf markers of change . 
 structural neuroimaging techniques are normally performed during the clinical assessment of patients with dementia  mainly to rule out structural lesions  such as brain tumors  normal pressure hydrocephalus  or vascular lesions . 
 the mri has shown high sensitivity to detect brain atrophy caused by the neurodegenerative process ( bobinski et al .  2000 ) . 
 several methods are used to analyze mri data including visual inspection  volumetry  or region of interest ( roi ) analysis ( applying manual tracing  automated  or semi - automated techniques ) and voxel based morphometry ( vbm ; vemuri and jack  2010 ) . 
 the visual rating of the images and roi analysis depend on the a priori choice of structures  while vbm is a whole - brain operator - independent analysis ( ashburner and friston  2000 ) . 
 however  vbm analysis only allows comparing groups of patients  and it is not useful to classify individual cases . 
 visual assessment of mri scans is a fast method to assess brain atrophy but is not the most precise ( raji et al .  2010 ) . 
 volumetry of the medial temporal lobe structures is the most common quantitative method used in ad . 
 the traditional manual tracing is time - consuming  and consequently  automated or semi - automated methods that require no significant manual intervention have been developed . 
 other methods to analyze sequential mris are boundary shift integral ( bsi ) and tensor - based morphometry ( tbm ) . 
 bsi has been developed to quantify the global percentage of change in the brain surfaces between two scans  while tbm provides a three - dimension profile of brain atrophy ( vemuri and jack  2010 ) . 
 brain mri studies have shown that ad patients have a widespread cortical volume loss  including the frontal lobes  the temporoparietal regions  precuneus  and mesial temporal lobes  with relative sparing of the sensorimotor  visual  and cerebellar regions ( du et al .  2001 ; good et al .  2001 
 ; thompson et al .  2001 ; karas et al .  2003 ; testa et al .  2004 ; ishii et al .  2005 ; dickerson et al .  2008 ; burton et al .  2009 ) 
 longitudinal studies have suggested that atrophy stars in the medial temporal lobes and fusiform gyrus in the prodromal phase of the disease  then spreads out to the posterior temporal and parietal lobes  and by the time of the dementia phase  it involves the medial temporal lobes  temporoparietal cortex  and the frontal lobe ( whitwell et al .  2007 ) . 
 this pattern of atrophy progression on mri appears to follow the distribution of nft in the different braak and braak ( 1991 ) pathological stages ( whitwell et al .  2008 ) . 
 in ad  there is also a greater rate of brain atrophy over time compared with healthy elderly subjects ( 1.92.2% per year versus 0.50.7% per year ; obrien et al .  2001 ; sluimer et al .  
 hippocampal and whole - brain atrophy in ad correlated well with cognitive performance and measures of disease severity ( jack et al .  2008a ; ridha et al .  2008 
 mri studies show a similar pattern of brain atrophy to that observed in ad ( jack et al .  2000 ; 
 chetelat et al .  2002 ; karas et al .  2004 ; bell - mcginty et al .  2005 ; whitwell et al .  
 2008 ) and rates of whole - brain atrophy are around 1% per year  between ad and control subjects ( jack et al .  2004 ) 
 . whole - brain atrophy rate in mci is associated with impaired cognitive performance ( evans et al .  2010 ) and predicts progression to ad dementia ( spulber et al .  2008 ) . 
 whole - brain techniques have also shown that higher rates of atrophy in specific areas such as the hippocampus  posterior cingulated gyrus  and superior parietal cortex were associated with incident ad in mci cases ( chetelat et al .  2005 )  and hippocampal and basal forebrain volumes in normal subjects predicted future development of ad ( hall et al .  2008 ) . 
 interestingly  a recent study showed that normal subjects with the ad csf profile had increased rates of brain atrophy over time  suggesting they may be in the pre - clinical phase of the neurodegenerative process ( schott et al .  2010 ) . 
 nevertheless  this observation requires a longer follow - up period to demonstrate that this particular group of subjects has a higher risk to develop ad dementia . because the most important clinical manifestation of ad is memory loss  
 the majority of the researchers have focused on the study of hippocampal atrophy as a marker of the disease . 
 different neuroimaging studies assessing the mesial temporal lobe structures have consistently shown smaller hippocampal volumes in ad patients compared to controls ( pennanen et al .  2004 ) . 
 measures of hippocampal atrophy correlate well with the degree of cognitive impairment ( jack et al . 
  2000 ; mortimer et al .  2004 ) and with ad pathology and hippocampal sclerosis in mri - post - mortem studies ( jagust et al .  2008 ) . 
 both normal aging and ad have gradual volume loss overtime  but as with whole - brain volume is greater in ad ; the annual rate of hippocampal atrophy is 1.41% for healthy controls and 
 several studies have shown that hippocampal atrophy measured by mri predicts conversion from mci to ad ( jack et al .  1999 ; visser et al .  1999  2002 ; geroldi et al . 
  2006 ; devanand et al .  2007 ; teipel et al .  2007 ) . 
 a recent meta - analysis showed that this measure could identify mci converters with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 81% ( yuan et al .  2009 ) . 
 although decreased entorhinal cortical thickness has been proposed as a predictor of conversion from mci to ad  measures of decrease hippocampal volume appeared to be a more robust predictor . 
 there are several limitations for the use of whole - brain or hippocampal volume as a sole biomarker for ad . 
 one of the most important is that small brain volumes can also be seen in normal aging  and consequently  is difficult to separate cases with early ad from normal controls . on the other hand  the rate of change on whole - brain  entorhinal  and hippocampal volumes seemed to be good markers of neurodegeneration and they can be useful in determining the effects of ad therapies  but these techniques are labor intensive and limited to research studies . 
 brain functional neuroimaging techniques  positron emission tomography ( pet ) and single photon emission computed tomography ( spect )  allow a broad range of cerebral functions to be assessed in patients currently living with dementia . 
 actually  brain metabolism  brain perfusion  and different neurotransmitter systems can be measured with a great variety of pet and spect tracers . 
 however  brain metabolism with the glucose analog 2-[f]-fluoro-2-deoxy - d - glucose ( f - fdg ) and brain perfusion with technetium-99 m hexamethylpropylamine oxime ( 99mtc - hmpao ) are the two more widely employed techniques in the evaluation of patients with dementia  both in clinical practice and in research . 
 brain spect with 99mtc - hmpao studies provide information of the regional cerebral blood flow  and f - fdg pet estimates the regional brain rate of glucose consumption  therefore providing information about the pattern of neuronal loss or synapse dysfunction in patients with dementia . 
 the pattern of spect hypoperfusion and pet hypometabolism usually seen ad involves the anterior medial temporal lobes  the posterior cingulate and posterior temporoparietal cortex ( kogure et al .  2000 ; 
 nevertheless  spect seems to be less accurate than pet for the diagnosis of ad . 
 one autopsy study found that this technique alone had a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 93% to diagnose ad ( jagust et al .  2001 ) . on the other hand 
 the sensitivity of this procedure discriminating ad from ftd was 71.5% and the specificity was 78.2%  while its sensitivity and specificity to differentiate ad from vascular dementia were 71.3 and 75.9%  respectively ( dougall et al . 
  spect has shown that can predict conversion to ad with a test accuracy of 82% ( huang et al .  2007 ) . 
 positron emission tomography studies in early ad have shown a pattern of reduced metabolism in the posterior cingulate ( minoshima et al .  1997 ) and mesial temporal cortices . 
 as the disease progresses  there is a greater involvement of the parietotemporal and frontal cortices ( ishii et al .  2001 ; 
 this progression of the areas of hypometabolism correlated with cognitive deterioration over time as measured by neuropsychological tests ( engler et al . 
 1984 ; minoshima et al .  1995 ; silverman et al .  2001 ; mosconi et al .  2005 ) . 
 a meta - analysis showed that pooled f - fdg pet sensitivity and specificity to differentiate ad patients from normal subjects were 86% in both cases  but the variability was important between the studies ( sensitivity from 61 to 100% and specificity from 54 to 100% ; patwardhan et al .  2004 ) . 
 pet also seems to be a good tool to differentiate ad from other forms of dementia . in an autopsy confirmed study  the presence of occipital hypometabolism was able to distinguish dlb from ad with 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity ( minoshima et al . 
 this technique also has a high specificity and sensibility to differentiate ad and ftd ( koeppe et al .  2005 ; 
 f - fdg pet appears to be a promising instrument to discriminate those patients with mci who will progress to ad dementia . 
 these patients show a medial temporal and posterior cingulate cortices hypometabolism compared with healthy controls ( chetelat et al . 
 has also shown that f - fdg pet performs slightly better than spect and structural mri in identifying the prodromal phase of ad in patients with a clinical diagnosis of mci ( pooled sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 85% ; yuan et al .  2009 ) . 
 interestingly  similar metabolic reductions in the same regions as those found in mci and ad patients have been seen in asymptomatic subjects at risk of ad  i.e.  in persons with subjective memory complains ( caselli et al .  2008 )  carriers of an apolipoprotein e 4 ( apoe4 ) allele ( reiman et al .  1996  2001  2004  2005 )  with abnormalities in the csf markers ( petrie et al .  2009 )  or with a maternal history of ad ( mosconi et al 
  2007  2009 ) . furthermore  hippocampal hypometabolism during normal aging predicted cognitive decline years in advance of the clinical diagnosis ( de leon et al .  2001 ; jagust et al . 
 these data indicate that f - fdg pet has high sensitivity to distinguish ad from controls and from other dementing entities  and also to identify subjects at high ad risk . 
 consequently  the pet ad pattern has been incorporated into the new clinical criteria for prodromal ad ( dubois et al .  2007 )  pre - clinical ad ( sperling et al .  2011 )  and mci due to ad ( albert et al .  
 the development of pet radiotracers that bind to brain amyloid has revolutionized the use of neuroimaging techniques in patients with dementia . 
 these molecules allow the localization of ad pathology in vivo  and have helped to further our understanding of the underlying biology of ad . 
 the most actively tested tracers are n - methyl-[c]2-(4-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole ( c - pib ; klunk et al .  
 2003 )  ( e)-4-(2-(6-(2-(2-(2-(18)f - fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)pyridin-3-yl)vinyl)-n - methyl benzenamine ( f - av-45 ; choi et al .  2009 ) and 2-(1 - 96-(2-f - fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino)-2-naphthyl)ethyldene ) malono nitrile ( f - fddnp ; small et al .  2006 ; shin et al .  2008 )  but there are multiple c and f compounds under investigation such as trans-4-(n - methyl - amino)-4-{2-[2-(2-[18f]fluoro - ethoxy)-ethoxy]-ethoxy}-stilbene ( f - bay94 - 9172 ; rowe et al .  2008 )  4-n-[c - methyl]amino-4-hydroxystilbene ( c - sb-13 ; verhoeff et al .  2004 ) and 2-(2-[2-dimethylaminothiazol-5-yl]ethenyl)-6-(2-[fluoro]ethoxy)benzoxazole ( c - bf-227 ; kudo et al .  2007 ) . 
 while c have better affinity for fibrillar amyloid than f compounds  the former have a very short life  which limits its use to centers with an available cyclotron that can produce them . among these tracers  
 this thioflavin - t derived binds fibrillar a with high affinity and its brain retention correlates well with levels of amyloid in ad brain tissue ( mathis et al .  2002  2003 ; 
 positron emission tomography studies with c - pib have demonstrated an increased retention of this tracer in frontal and parietotemporal cortices  as well as in the striatum of almost all ad patients compared with controls ( klunk et al . 
  2004 ; edison et al .  2006 ; rowe et al .  2007 ) . however  it is important to note that a positive c - pib pet scan can also be seen in other entities  often misdiagnosed as ad  such as dlb and cerebral amyloid angiopathy ( edison et al .  2008 ; gomperts et al .  2008 ; dierksen et al .  
 c - pib retention in ad correlates with rates of whole - brain atrophy ( archer et al .  2006 )  parietotemporal hypometabolism on f - fdg pet ( klunk et al . 
  2004 ; edison et al .  2006 ; engler et al .  2006 )  and decreased csf a42 levels ( fagan et al .  2006 ; grimmer et al . 
 there are few longitudinal studies using amyloid ligands  and the observation time has been relatively short  because these techniques have only been available for research since 2004 . 
 recent longitudinal studies in ad patients assessing amyloid load and progression of neurodegeneration using structural mri or f - fdg pet found that c - pib retention was relatively stable over time  while neurodegenerative markers worsen in parallel with cognitive decline ( engler et al .  2006 ; jack et al .  2009 ; scheinin et al .  2009 ; kadir et al .  
 these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that there is dissociation between the amyloid deposition and the neurodegenerative process  where amyloid accumulation precedes the clinical symptoms and reaches its maximum detectable level before the cognitive deficits are evident ( jack et al .  2010a ) . 
 however  another recent study has shown increases of c - pib retention in mild to moderate ad dementia  questioning this hypothesis and suggesting that a deposition might slow down in the later stages of the disease  but it is still present ( villemagne et al .  2011 ) . in mci patients  
 c - pib pet shows a bimodal distribution with some subjects having a pattern of retention similar to ad patients and others similar to control subjects ( pike et al .  2007 ; rowe et al . 
 in these patients  the a burden is related to episodic memory impairment but not to other cognitive tasks ( pike et al .  2007 ) . 
 the pib - positive mci subjects are more likely to carry an apoe4 allele and to progress to ad ( pike et al .  2007 ; 
 factors that seem to influence a shorter time to progression in pib - positive subjects is the presence of hippocampal atrophy  higher c - pib retention values and having an apoe4 allele ( okello et al .  2009 ; 
 ( 2009 ) rescanned mci subjects after a single year  but only a minimal change has seen in this group of persons 
 2011 ) have shown small but significant increases in c - pib cortical retention in mci patients from the baseline studies to scans to those performed from 20  months to 3  years later ; other studies have reported similar results ( kadir et al .  2010 ; koivunen et al .  
  approximately 2030% of elderly cognitively normal subjects show some degree of c - pib retention  mainly in the prefrontal cortex  posterior cingulate and precuneus regions ( mintun et al .  2006 ; pike et al . 
  2007 ; rowe et al .  2007 ; aizenstein et al .  2008 ) . 
 in fact  the proportion of c - pib - positive healthy control subjects increases with age ( morris et al .  2010 ) . in these subjects  
 some studies have reported a strong relationship between impaired episodic memory performance and c - pib binding that could be modified by cognitive reserve ( pike et al . 
 2010 )  but some others have not found this association ( mintun et al .  2006 ; jack et al .  2008b ; stornadt et al .  2009 ) . 
 studies directly relating structural mri data to a burden in control subjects has yield contradictory results . 
 2009 )  a cortical thinning pattern consistent with early ad ( dickerson et al .  2008 ; 
 becker et al .  2010 ) and an increased rate of brain atrophy ( scheinin et al .  2009 )  while others have found brain atrophy only in c - pib - positive subjects or in normal individuals with subjective cognitive impairment ( chetelat et al .  
 there are only two longitudinal studies reporting progression of cognitively normal subjects scanned with c - pib pet to symptomatic ad . in one study  
 2009 ) reported that the relative risk of conversion from cognitive normal to ad was increased almost five - fold with a c - pib - positive pet scan . 
 ( 2011 ) performed serial c - pib pet scans in a group of normal subjects and found that 25% of individuals with a positive scan developed mci or ad dementia by 3  years . 
 in addition  the authors also reported an increase in c - pib brain retention in those control subjects with a positive baseline scan  suggesting a slow process of a accumulation in the brain over time ( villemagne et al . 
 these data are consistent with the hypothesis that amyloid imaging can detect a accumulation in advance of the onset of dementia ( jack et al .  2010a )  although more longitudinal studies are required to determinate the sequence of pathological events in the process from normalcy to ad . 
 figure 3 shows the spectrum of amyloid deposition in normal controls  mci and ad cases  as measured with c - pib pet ( mathis et al .  2007 ) . 
 transaxial and sagittal planes of c - pib pet scans in a normal control ( nc )  a c - pib - positive nc ( nc+ )  c - pib - negative mci subject ( mci )  a c - pib - positive mci subject ( mci+ )  a highly c - pib - positive mci subject ( mci++ )  and a c - pib - positive ad patient ( ad ) . reprinted from mathis et al . 
 although amyloid imaging is a relatively new technique  we can state that it accurately detects a accumulation in the brain . 
 however  it has been reported the case of a patient clinically diagnosed of mild ad with a negative c - pib pet scan  where low levels of amyloid pathology at autopsy were found ( cairns et al .  2009 ) . 
 on the other hand  there are not reported cases of subjects with a positive amyloid pet without presence of a at autopsy . 
 these data suggests that c - pib pet is a technique with high specificity and positive predictive value for early ad diagnosis . 
 nevertheless  having an c - pib - positive scan does not mean to be at a pre - dementia stage of ad  and the prognostic value of increased a load on pet has to be established with more extensive longitudinal studies . 
 in this scenario  adding techniques that assess functional brain changes suggesting early ad could be of special interest . 
 definitely  the information obtained with current amyloid tracers will bring to light important issues in the biology of amyloid deposition in the transition from normal to ad . 
 current data suggest that diagnosis of ad can be enhanced by use of these promising biomarkers to increase accuracy and identify early stages of the disease . 
 each of these biomarkers seems to indicate a specific process in ad  so that amyloid imaging and decreased csf a42 are indicators of brain amyloid burden  while csf tau  brain atrophy and brain metabolism are biomarkers of the neurodegenerative process . 
 some authors have proposed a model of disease in which there is timing for the use of different biomarkers ( jack et al .  2010a ) . 
 the ad pathologic cascade appears to have a sequential two stage process initiated by amyloid accumulation and followed by neuronal pathology . to validate this hypothesis and the right use of biomarkers in the clinical practice  
 it is necessary to determine the dynamics of the amyloid process with other biomarkers at the different stages of the disease . 
 an early ad diagnosis could enable to administer treatments with potential disease - modifying effect before neurodegeneration becomes severe . 
 the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .","

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, affecting daily living activities. Biomarkers, such as cerebrospinal fluid proteins and imaging techniques, are being studied for early detection and management of AD.

Research and Discussion:
Recent studies have shown high sensitivity for AD diagnosis based on clinical criteria, but it is not perfect. The use of biomarkers may improve early detection in the clinical setting and aid in research studies and drug trials for better disease management.

Results and Conclusion:
Cerebrospinal fluid proteins, structural and functional neuroimaging, and amyloid imaging are among the most studied biomarkers for AD. These biomarkers have the potential to increase our understanding of the underlying biology of AD and improve its detection and management in both research and clinical settings."
"joseph disease  is the most common subtype of sca world - wide  and is caused by a pathologic cag trinucleotide repeat expansion in the atxn3 gene located on chromosome 14q32.12 . 
 the cardinal clinical characteristics of sca3 include gait and stance unsteadiness  limb ataxia  dysarthria  oculomotor dysfunction  sensory disorder  pyramidal and extrapyramidal dysfunction  and so on . 
 sca3 is a slowly progressive and unremitting disease  in which patients generally will become wheelchair - bound and bedridden in the end stage  and the median survival time after disease onset is approximately 21 years . 
 the resulting loss of working ability and reduced survival confer significant disease burden to the patients  their families  and the society . 
 thus  it is of vital importance to explore effective therapeutic options in order to alleviate the symptoms or retard the disease progression in sca3 
 . nerve growth factor ( ngf ) is the founding member of the neurotrophin family  and is essential for the proper development  patterning  and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system . 
 previous studies have revealed that ngf specifically targets sensory and sympathetic neurons in the peripheral nervous system  as well as basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system . there is also growing evidence to support the role of ngf in the development  differentiation  and maintenance of the human cerebellar connectivity . in this context  ngf and its high - affinity receptor tachykinin receptor antagonist ( tkra ) 
 these data imply that ngf may have neuroprotective effects on cerebellar neurons and hence might serve as a therapeutic candidate of sca3 . 
 therefore  this clinical pilot study was set forth to examine the efficacy of ngf in patients with sca3 . 
 this study was an open - label clinical trial assessing the efficacy of ngf in patients with sca3 ; it was conducted at the first affiliated hospital of zhengzhou university from november 2011 to november 2012 . 
 this study was approved by the ethics committee of first affiliated hospital of zhengzhou university and registered at the chinese clinical trial registry ( www.chictr.org ; chictr - onc-11001954 ) . 
 all study procedures were in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and all recruited subjects have provided written informed consents . 
 ataxia patients with family history were screened at the department of neurology  first affiliated hospital of zhengzhou university and referred for genetic testing at the department of genetic diagnosis . 
 patients who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria : ( 1 ) ataxia patients with family history were checked and diagnosed by two independent doctors  then the genotype sca3 was confirmed by genetic test ; ( 2 ) older than 18 years ; and ( 3 ) willing to give informed consent  will be recruited . 
 the exclusion criteria were as follows : ( 1 ) allergy to neurotrophin ; ( 2 ) with concomitant severe systematic diseases or psychiatric disorders ; ( 3 ) unable to finish the scale for assessment and rating of ataxia ( sara ) score ; ( 4 ) refuse to attend the study  and ( 5 ) ataxias attributed to secondary causes ( such as alcohol or drug abuse and toxic exposure ) . 
 all enrolled patients underwent standard neurological  electrophysiological and neuroimaging examinations  and the sca3 subtype was classified according to these clinical findings . 
 china ) used in this study was extracted and purified from the submandibular gland of the male mouse and has high homology in the amino acid sequence with human ngf . 
 the mngf has been safely used in a series of clinical studies .  and has been approved by china food and drug administration . 
 mngf was administered peripherally by intramuscular injection at the dose of 18 g once daily for 4 weeks consecutively . 
 it has been proven to have good reliability and validity among chinese patients with degenerative cerebellar . 
 the sara evaluates axial ( gait  stance  sitting )  speech  and appendicular ( finger chase  nose - finger test  fast alternating hand movements ( fahms )  and heel - shin slide ) functions . 
 the sara sum score ranges from 0 to 40 with 0 indicating no ataxia and 40 the most severe ataxia  thus deterioration or improvement of disease severity is  respectively  represented by an increase or decrease of the sara score . for each patient  
 chinese version of sara was performed at the baseline  2 weeks ( midpoint ) and 4 weeks ( endpoint ) after treatment . 
 these sara evaluations were all videotaped and reviewed independently by two other investigators who did not attend the original assessment in a random order . 
 the average of score rated by these two evaluators was denoted as the final sara score . 
 the primary outcome measure was the change of sara score after treatment compared with that at baseline . 
 continuous variables were expressed as mean  standard deviation ( sd )  and categorical variables were expressed as frequencies or proportions where appropriate . 
 the observed changes of sara score after treatment from baseline were analyzed with nonparametric wilcoxon signed - rank test . 
 continuous variables were expressed as mean  standard deviation ( sd )  and categorical variables were expressed as frequencies or proportions where appropriate . 
 the observed changes of sara score after treatment from baseline were analyzed with nonparametric wilcoxon signed - rank test . 
 the mean age was 39.14  7.81 years  the mean age of onset was 35.00  6.53 years  the mean disease duration was 4.14  1.90 years  and the mean cag repeats number was 77.57  2.27 . 
 the mean sara score dropped from 8.48  2.40 to 6.94  2.34 ( p < 0.001 ) and 6.30  1.87 ( p < 0.001 ) after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment  respectively [ table 2 ] . 
 significant decrease in subsections sara scores was also observed in stance ( p = 0.008 and 0.003 )  speech ( p = 0.046 and 0.023 )  finger - chase ( p = 0.026 and 0.015 )  fahms ( 0.015 and 0.009 )  and heel - shin slide ( p = 0.006 and 0.001 ) at 2 and 4 weeks after therapy  respectively . 
 the mean improvement in total sara score was 2.18  1.30 ( ranging from 0 to 5.75 ) in our study .

 sara : scale of the assessment of rating of ataxia ; fahm : fast alternating hand movements ; ngf : nerve growth factor . 
 one previous study has shown that insulin - like growth factor-1  one of the neurotrophic factors  may be effective in reducing the disease progression of sca3 . 
 previous studies have reported that ngf can improve cognitive decline in patients with alzheimer 's disease and may also have potential therapeutic roles in other neurodegenerative diseases . 
 postmortem histopathological study in patients with sca3 has revealed considerable neuronal loss at the cerebellar purkinje cell layer and the four deep cerebellar nuclei . 
 ngf can prevent neuronal death or age - related atrophy in the adult brain by inhibiting apoptosis of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain  and it would be reasonable to postulate that it may also inhibit the apoptosis in the cerebellum neurons expressing tyrosine kinase a ( trka ) and serve as a potential therapy for sca3 . 
 such treatment effect is observed as early as 2 weeks after therapy and sustained after 4 weeks . to our knowledge  this study is the first to investigate the efficacy of ngf in sca3 . 
 postmortem study has shown that ngf and its high - affinity receptor tkra are distributed in the neurons of the human cerebellum cortex and its deep nuclei throughout life . 
 these findings support the involvement of ngf in the development  differentiation and maintenance of the cerebellar connectivity . 
 although the blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) has low permeability to large proteins  some autoradiography studies suggested ed that blood - borne ngf and its subunit -ngf can cross the bbb of mice and arrive at the brain parenchyma by direct permeation . 
 second  the therapeutic effect of ngf might also be mediated via the proprioceptive sensation system . 
 it has been reported that most ( 87% ) of the sca3 patients had somatosensory evoked potential abnormalities  especially in the lower limbs  which was due to degenerative lesions in the dorsal column of the spinal cord . 
 hence  ngf therapy may improve stance and heel - knee - shin slide due to improved proprioception . 
 these two proposed mechanisms may explain the observed improvement after therapy and substantiate the use ngf to treat a patient with sca3 . 
 first  it was an open - label study  in which the observed therapeutic efficacy might be contributed by placebo effects . however  in one randomized  double - blind  and placebo - controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline in sca3 patients  the mean improvements of sara score in the therapeutic group  and the placebo group were 1.97 and 0.86  respectively . 
 the sara score improvement of 2.18 in our current study is unlikely to be accounted for by placebo effect alone . 
 furthermore  sara is a reliable and valid scale to linearly assess the ataxia symptoms  and changes of sara scores exceeding 1.1 points are considered clinically relevant . 
 nevertheless  our pilot data suggest that ngf may be a promising treatment for patients with sca3 . a large - scale randomized 
  double - blind placebo - controlled trial would be worthwhile to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ngf in sca3 patients .","

1) Abstract:
This study evaluated the effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) on patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), a progressive and incurable neurodegenerative disease. After 28 days of NGF treatment, there were significant improvements in ataxia symptoms according to the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA).

2) Research and Discussion:
Previous studies have suggested the potential therapeutic effects of NGF in neurodegenerative diseases. In this open-label prospective study, 21 SCA3 patients were treated with NGF for 28 days. The mean total SARA score significantly decreased, with improvements in specific SARA subsections such as stance, speech, and hand movements.

3) Results and Conclusion:
Based on this preliminary data, NGF may be effective in treating SCA3 patients. Long-term studies with larger sample sizes are needed to further assess the efficacy and safety of NGF treatment for this progressive and currently incurable disease. NGF may hold promise as a potential therapeutic option for SCA3, providing hope for patients and their families."
"nanopores are powerful research tools to investigate the structural and dynamic properties of single biomolecules . 
 nanopores have inner diameters of a few nanometers  and following the size - exclusion principle  only individual dna or protein molecules can fit into or pass through a pore . 
 importantly  a passing molecule blocks a pore  leading to a transient change of current . 
 parameters of the current blockade such as duration and amplitude can give information about the length and size of the molecule . 
 one of the most widely published and scientifically attractive subjects is the sensing of dna with nanopores . while an ultimate goal of these studies is to develop an inexpensive method to sequence dna ( dekker 2007 ; branton et al . 
 2010 )  a large array of experiments have also shed light on the biophysics of dna or rna translocation through biological pores ( kasianowicz et al . 
 ; healy 2007 ; vercoutere and akeson 2002 ; deamer and branton 2002 ; marziali and akeson 2001 ) as well as inorganic pores ( reviewed in  e.g.  howorka and siwy 2009 ; healy et al . 2007 ; dekker 2007 ) . examined aspects include ( i ) the frequency with which the strands thread into the pore ( henrickson et al . 2000 ; meller and branton 2002 ; nakane et al . 
 2008 )  ( ii ) the orientation of strands ( butler et al . 2006 ; wang et al . 2004 ; mathe et al . 2005 ; wanunu et al . 2008 ; wiggin et al . 2008 ; li et al . 2003 ; chen et al . 2004 ; storm et al . 2005 ; fologea et al . 2007 ; steinbock et al . 2010 )  ( iii ) the speed of dna transport ( meller et al . 2001 ; wanunu et al . 
 2008 )  ( iv ) the influence of transmembrane potential ( aksimentiev and schulten 2005 ; mathe et al . 2005 ; kathawalla et al . 1989 ; heng et al . 2005 ; keyser et al . 
 2006 )  ( v ) pore geometry ( howorka and bayley 2002 ) as well as ( vi ) interaction with pore walls ( wiggin et al . 2008 ; wanunu et al . 2008 
 covalently attaching dna to the pore wall is an attractive variation in single - molecule research . in previous studies aimed at dna sensing  one or multiple single stranded dna ( ssdna ) molecules were end - tethered to the pore wall of protein ( howorka et al . 
 complementary or mismatched dna molecules showed that dna duplexes between the free and tethered strands form inside the nanopore . 
 as the perfect and mismatched duplexes  respectively  had different lifetimes  the dna - modified nanopores could be used as biosensor elements to distinguish nucleic acids with single - point mutations ( howorka et al . 
 the covalent attachment of dna strands has also been exploited to control the electronic properties of a pore . in general  artificial pores that exhibit engineered properties such as voltage gating or ion selectivity are attractive model systems for biological voltage - gated ion channels ( hille 2001 ) . 
 ( 2004 ) were the first to demonstrate that dna - modified nanopores can function as ionic switches . 
 a single gold nanotube carrying thiol - terminated dna strands was shown to preferentially transport cations in one direction  while hindering transport in the other . 
 the ion current rectification was explained by assuming that dna molecules deflect by the external electric field and cause voltage - dependent pore opening . 
 the attached dna strands were not localized to a single subnanoscale position but covered the entire pore . 
 additionally  the length of the fully extended dna molecules was smaller than the pore diameter ; hence  it was not possible to completely block the current ( e.g.  59-nm - diameter gold tube was modified with 30-mer dna ) . with the aim of achieving a greater pore blockade and ion current modulations  this study attempts to tune the ionic pore properties by restricting dna immobilization to a small nanoscale region . 
 single conically shaped nanopores with an opening of 8 or 12  nm were selectively modified at the narrow section with ssdna oligonucleotides ( fig . 
 1 ) with a length of 30 nucleotides . we compared the current  voltage curves of single nanopores before and after dna modification at different kcl concentrations between 1  m and 10  mm . 
 the experimental results indicate that the attached dna either reduced or blocked the ionic current flow through the pore dependent on ionic strength  which also influenced the conformation of the dna strands ( odijk 1977 ; skolnick and fixman 1977 ; kaiser and rant 2010 ) . 
 1scheme of the surface charge pattern obtained in the process of one - sided modification of a single conically shaped nanopore with point - tethered dna molecules . 
 we estimate the position of the junction between the dna - modified zone and the zone with carboxyl groups to be several tens of nanometers from the small opening of the pore ( vlassiouk and siwy 2007 ) . 
 carboxyl groups are formed in the process of pore preparation scheme of the surface charge pattern obtained in the process of one - sided modification of a single conically shaped nanopore with point - tethered dna molecules . 
 we estimate the position of the junction between the dna - modified zone and the zone with carboxyl groups to be several tens of nanometers from the small opening of the pore ( vlassiouk and siwy 2007 ) . 
 carboxyl groups are formed in the process of pore preparation in addition  the dna - modified conical nanopores presented here function as rectifiers . 
 rectifying systems have a preferential direction of mass flow and  in some cases  can entirely stop the flow in the opposite direction  forming a diode . 
 rectifiers and diodes based on surface charge patterns on the pore walls have previously been created  but these previous embodiments were able to switch the transport of just ions and charged species ( bassignana and reiss 1983 ; mafe and ramirez 1997 ; daiguji et al . 
 2005 ; vlassiouk and siwy 2007 ; nguyen et al . 2010 ; cheng and guo 2009 ) . as an example 
  an ionic bipolar diode was built based on nanopores that contained a junction between positive and negative charges on the pore walls ( vlassiouk and siwy 2007 ; cheng and guo 2009 ) . 
 a unipolar diode is formed with a junction between positive ( or negative ) surface charges and a neutral zone ( karnik et al . 
 by contrast  the dna - modified nanopores presented here feature an opening diameter that is tuned by the operation conditions  e.g.  kcl concentration and voltage . 
 the rationally engineered pores can thus be applied to tune and switch the transport of both ionic and neutral species . 
 single conically shaped nanopores were prepared by the track - etching technique according to a published procedure ( fleischer et al . 
 briefly  12-m - thick films of polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) were irradiated with single heavy ions ( e.g.  au  u ) with a kinetic energy of ~2  gev . 
 irradiation was performed at the linear accelerator unilac at the institute for heavy ions research ( gsi )  darmstadt  germany ( spohr 1983 ) . after tracking  
 foils were etched from one side in 9  m naoh to form conically shaped nanopores ( apel et al . 
 the other side of the membrane was protected against etching by an acidic stopping solution . 
 the preparation was performed in a conductivity cell so that the pore opening could be observed electrochemically . 
 once an etching current of ~200 pa was recorded  the membrane was washed with the stopping medium and kcl solution . 
 the transport properties of single pet nanopores were investigated in kcl solutions buffered to ph 8 with tris buffer . 
 an approximate diameter of the small opening of the conical pore was determined using conductance measurements as described previously ( apel et al . 
  both sides of a single nanopore membrane were placed in contact with 1  m kcl . 
 ag / agcl electrodes were immersed into each solution  and a current  voltage curve was recorded for voltages between + 100 and 100  mv . in this voltage regime 
 the nanopores produce a linear current  voltage curve whose slope provides the ionic resistance ( rp ) of the nanopore . 
 the tip diameter ( d ) is related to rp via \documentclass[12pt]{minimal }

				 \begin{document}$$ r_{p } = { \frac{4\rho l}{\pi dd } } $ $ \end{document }  where l is the membrane thickness   is the specific ionic resistance of the electrolyte and d is the base ( big opening of the cone ) diameter . 
 the diameter d was determined from the so - called bulk - etch rate of a polymer material . for pet and etching conditions of 20c and 9  m naoh  the bulk - etch rate is equal to 2.13  nm / min ( apel et al . 2001 ) . 
 the value of d was then determined from the formula d  =  2    2.13 t ( nm )  where t is time of etching in minutes . the validity of this relation was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy studies ( wharton et al . 
 pore walls and the surface of track - etched pet films contain carboxyl groups at a density of ~1 group / nm ( wolf - reber 2002 ) . 
 the carboxyl groups were the attachment points to covalently couple amino - modified dna using a procedure which had been previously applied for other surface modification purposes . in the procedure  
 carboxyl groups are activated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide hydrochloride ( edc ) and then coupled to the amine  forming an amide ( vlassiouk and siwy 2007 ) . 
 a dna oligonucleotide with a 5-terminal amino c12 spacer and the sequence 5-cgc gag aagtta cat gac ctg tag acg atc-3 was purchased from integrated dna technologies ( coralville  ia ) . 
 the received amount of 1267 nm was dissolved in 500  l of 0.1  m mes buffer  ph 5.5 . in the amidation protocol 
  the dna and edc solution was placed in contact with the small opening of the pore  while the large opening of the pore was in contact with 0.1  m 2-(n - morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid ( mes ) solution  ph 5.5  for 24-h incubation . placing the modifying agent only on one side of the membrane

 single conically shaped nanopores were prepared by the track - etching technique according to a published procedure ( fleischer et al . 
 briefly  12-m - thick films of polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) were irradiated with single heavy ions ( e.g.  au  u ) with a kinetic energy of ~2  gev . 
 irradiation was performed at the linear accelerator unilac at the institute for heavy ions research ( gsi )  darmstadt  germany ( spohr 1983 ) . after tracking  
 foils were etched from one side in 9  m naoh to form conically shaped nanopores ( apel et al . 
 the other side of the membrane was protected against etching by an acidic stopping solution . 
 the preparation was performed in a conductivity cell so that the pore opening could be observed electrochemically . 
 once an etching current of ~200 pa was recorded  the membrane was washed with the stopping medium and kcl solution . 
 the transport properties of single pet nanopores were investigated in kcl solutions buffered to ph 8 with tris buffer . 
 an approximate diameter of the small opening of the conical pore was determined using conductance measurements as described previously ( apel et al . 
  both sides of a single nanopore membrane were placed in contact with 1  m kcl . 
 ag / agcl electrodes were immersed into each solution  and a current  voltage curve was recorded for voltages between + 100 and 100  mv . in this voltage regime 
 the nanopores produce a linear current  voltage curve whose slope provides the ionic resistance ( rp ) of the nanopore .

 the diameter d was determined from the so - called bulk - etch rate of a polymer material . for pet and etching conditions of 20c and 9  m naoh  the bulk - etch rate is equal to 2.13  nm / min ( apel et al . 2001 ) . 
 the value of d was then determined from the formula d  =  2    2.13 t ( nm )  where t is time of etching in minutes . the validity of this relation was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy studies ( wharton et al . 
 pore walls and the surface of track - etched pet films contain carboxyl groups at a density of ~1 group / nm ( wolf - reber 2002 ) . 
 the carboxyl groups were the attachment points to covalently couple amino - modified dna using a procedure which had been previously applied for other surface modification purposes . in the procedure  
 carboxyl groups are activated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide hydrochloride ( edc ) and then coupled to the amine  forming an amide ( vlassiouk and siwy 2007 ) . 
 a dna oligonucleotide with a 5-terminal amino c12 spacer and the sequence 5-cgc gag aagtta cat gac ctg tag acg atc-3 was purchased from integrated dna technologies ( coralville  ia ) .

 figure 2a presents a set of current  voltage curves of a single conically shaped nanopore with small and big openings of 8 and 400 nm  respectively . 
 a positive voltage in our electrode configuration corresponds to a positively biased electrode placed at the big opening of a conical nanopore  and vice versa for a negative voltage . 
 similar to previous reports  the conical nanopore rectified the ion current due to breaking of the symmetry of the electric potential inside the pore ( siwy and fulinski 2002 ; hanggi and marchesoni 2009 ; cervera et al . 2005 ) . 
 in particular  the broken symmetry affected the interactions between k ions and the negatively charged carboxyl groups on the pore walls . 
 the rectification was quantified by calculating the so - called rectification degree  which is a ratio of currents for voltages of the same absolute value but of opposite polarity  e.g.  i(3  v)/i(+3  v ) . the negatively charged nanopores have transference numbers found from the reversal potential ( hille 2001 ) of at least 0.8  which indicates that ~80% of the current is carried by potassium ions ( cervera et al . 
 the larger currents for negative voltages correspond to cations moving from the small opening to the large opening of the pore . 
 the experimentally found ion current rectification and selectivity properties of conically shaped nanopores were modeled using the poisson - nernst - planck ( pnp ) equations ( cervera et al . 
 2005  2006  2007 ; white and bund 2008 ) as well as monte carlo ( he et al .

 are significantly higher than at the corresponding positive voltage  thereby validating that the negative voltage corresponds to the high conductance state . given that the concentration of cations is higher than that of anions for negative and positive potentials  the plot in fig . 
 the modeling furthermore revealed that in the case of conically shaped nanopores  the quantitative estimation of cation selectivity ( based on the reversal potential measurements ) holds true only for low voltages . at high negative potentials

 2009 ) . opening diameters of the modeled nanopore were set at 5 and 500  nm it is well known that the pores rectify only if the walls have excess surface charge and when the pore diameter is comparable to the thickness of the electrical double - layer ( siwy and fulinski 2002 ; cervera et al . 
 2006 ) . as a consequence  the rectification degree of the conically shaped nanopores in 1 
 m kcl was lower than that in 0.1  m and 10  mm kcl . 
 2a ) 2.7 ( |15.4| na  5.68 na ) in 1  m  4.7 ( |8.32| na  1.75 na ) in 0.1  m kcl and 4.9 ( |4.08| na  0.828 na ) in 10  mm kcl . 
 the small difference in rectification degrees between 0.1  m and 10  mm kcl is in agreement with predictions based on the pnp equations  which point to a nonlinear dependence of the rectification degree on kcl concentration ( cervera et al . 
 the modeling also showed the optimal ratio between the pore diameter and the screening length that produces the highest rectification degree . for a 6-nm - diameter conical 
 pore  the concentration range at which the pore was predicted to rectify most was between ~0.12 and 0.40  m kcl ( cervera et al . 
 the optimal concentration range is shifted to more diluted solutions ; and in the 8-nm pore studied here  at 10  mm and 0.1  m kcl the pore rectified almost equally well . 
 a very different behavior was observed after modifying the tip of the same nanopore with 30-nucleotide - long ssdna . 
 figure  3 compares current  voltage curves of the pore before and after dna modification for 1  m  0.1  m and 10  mm kcl . 
 for all these concentrations  the dna modification caused a significant decrease of the current  which suggests that the long dna molecules physically occluded the pore and diminished its effective opening diameter.fig .

 m kcl  no differences between currents recorded for forward and reverse voltage sweeps were observed the experimental results suggest that occlusion of the pore by dna becomes more pronounced with lowering the ionic strength . at 1 
 m kcl  attachment of dna caused a decrease of ~2.5-fold of ion current compared to a non - modified pore ( fig . 
 3a )  while at 10 mm kcl  the dna - modified nanopore exhibited at least five times lower current ( fig . 
 any explanation of the observed current change has to consider two effects which were initially used to describe experiments performed with non - attached pore - translocating dna strands ( smeets et al . 
 firstly  each dna molecule excludes a certain volume in the pore so that fewer ions are available for transport . 
 secondly  dna molecules are heavily charged ; thus  their presence brings more counter - ions to the pore lumen . 
 insertion of dna molecules in the pore can therefore cause a decrease or an increase of the current  depending on whether the number of excluded ions is larger or smaller than the number of additionally introduced dna counterions . 
 both effects have been observed in systematic experiments on threading single dna molecules through unmodified nanopores ( smeets et al . 
 2006 ) . in dependence of the concentration of the background electrolyte  the pore - threaded dna molecules caused a positive or negative spike of the current . in all reported cases  lowering 
 the kcl concentration of the background electrolyte caused the dna counter - ions to become dominant . 
 our observation that a decrease in kcl concentration leads to an increase of the pore blockage suggests that a simple explanation based on volume exclusion and electrostatic effects is insufficient . 
 it is more likely that the transmembrane current is additionally influenced by changes in the conformation of the dna molecules . 
 this effect has recently been observed with dna molecules attached to gold surfaces ( kaiser and rant 2010 ) . in the experiments  
 the background electrolyte concentration caused the dna molecules to be more extended  and in concentrations ~1  mm the molecules became entirely stretched . 
 the length of the dna strand was determined by applying a negative potential to the gold surface and determining the quenching of a fluorophore which was attached to the other dna end . 
 these results were explained by considering the dependence of the mechanical rigidity of ssdna on the ionic strength of the environment . 
 theories of odijk ( 1977 ) as well as skolnick and fixman ( 1977 ) distinguish bare ( l0 ) and electrostatic ( le ) contributions to the total persistence length of a charged molecule lp : \documentclass[12pt]{minimal }

 the parameters kb and t have their usual meaning of the boltzmann constant and temperature  respectively . the length le becomes important only at lower concentrations ; e.g.  at 10  mm kcl it equals ~10  nm . applied to our dna - modified pore  this high length obviously increases the volume of the dna strands and could thereby help explain the high level of occlusion observed for the nanopore which measures 8  nm in diameter ( fig . 
 it is also important to mention that for the lowest studied kcl concentration of 10  mm  the current  voltage curves exhibited a strong hysteresis  especially for negative voltages ( fig . 
 when the voltage sweep started at negative voltages  the currents were typically significantly lower than in the case when the sweep started from positive voltages . 
 we think that the hysteresis is caused by the voltage - induced movement of the attached dna strands as well as voltage - dependent ionic concentrations  as discussed above . 
 figure  4 summarizes a model which accounts for the observed hysteresis and high currents for a sweep from positive to negative transmembrane potentials . 
 when a positively biased electrode is placed at the wide opening of the pore  the dna molecules are expected to be deflected away from the narrow opening and toward the wide opening  which does not present any significant steric hindrance for the strands ( fig .  4  region a ) . 
 due to the conical shape of the pore  this voltage polarity constitutes the lower conductance state of the device . 
 reducing the positive voltage and switching it to the negative values forces the dna strands to deflect toward the small opening of the pore ( fig .  4  region b ) . 
 it is recalled that at negative voltages concentrations of potassium and chloride ions in the region close to the small pore opening increase at least several times compared to the bulk concentration ( fig . 
 this region with elevated ionic concentration is rather wide and reaches several hundreds of nanometers away from the narrow opening . 
 consequently  the dna strands in the modified pore are in contact with high concentrations of potassium and chloride ions  which in turn likely causes dna to assume a more compact form ( fig .  4  region b)in line with results from kaiser and rant ( 2010 ) . 
 at moderate negative voltages the currents through the pore are large  leading to high rectification degrees . at negative voltages above a threshold value of ~2 
 3d  4 )  dna molecules might become extended due to the electric field ( heng et al . 2005 ; randall et al . 
 2006 ) so that the nanopore is again more blocked ( fig .  4  region c).fig .

 we think that this process occurs with significantly more severe steric hindrance because lowering the negative applied voltage decreases the ionic concentrations in the pore  causing the dna to maintain a more elongated form induced by the high voltage  thereby leading to a greater pore blockade . in order to support our general hypothesis on the conformation dependent occlusion of nanopores by dna molecules 
 we expected that in this case the dna would lead to a less extensive pore blockade based on geometric grounds .

 3 )  the wider structure is characterized by not only a less extensive blockade but also higher negative currents after the dna modification . the larger current after dna modification suggests  according to smeets et al . 
 ( 2006 )  that the number of dna counter - ions exceeds the number of ions that are excluded from the nanopore . 
 most likely  dna attachment increases the local surface charge density and consequently enhances ionic concentrations at the narrow opening.fig .

 b current  voltage curves of 12-nm dna - modified nanopore in 10  mm kcl  ph 8  for forward bias ( gray squares ) and reverse bias ( red squares ) the wider nanopore also exhibited an ion current rectification degree in 0.1  m kcl  4  v equal to almost 17  which is three times higher than the rectification degree of the 8-nm dna - modified pore ( fig . 
 this observation was at first puzzling to us as one would expect a higher rectification degree for a narrower pore . 
 one possible explanation is that the dna conformational change makes the pore structure less asymmetric and less rectifying . 
 another explanation takes into account the dependence of the rectification degree of a conical nanopore on ionic strength  which we already discussed above . 
 there is an optimal ratio of pore diameter and screening length for a maximal rectification degree ( cervera et al . 
 2006 ) . for concentrations that are lower than the optimum for a given pore diameter  
 with dna  the nanopore is effectively smaller so that the pore might be outside its optimal rectifying regime . 
 as expected  for the wider conical nanopore in 10  mm kcl  the hysteresis of ion currents recorded for forward and reverse voltage sweeps was much less pronounced compared to the 8-nm nanopore ( see figs . 
 we have prepared an ionic rectifying system based on single conically shaped nanopores whose small opening was modified with ssdna . 
 in contrast to previously designed bipolar and unipolar diodes ( vlassiouk and siwy 2007 ; karnik et al . 
 2007 ) containing stationary surface charges  the attached dna molecules are flexible and assume different configurations depending on the operation conditions such as kcl concentration and voltage . 
 our experimental results provide evidence that the level of nanopore blockage and  most likely  the persistence length of tethered dna increase with lower kcl concentration . due to the salt - dependent dna volume  the nanopore changes its effective diameter and thus can be applicable in building systems to control transport of both charged and neutral species . in future research  we will systematically study the transport properties of dna - modified pores as a function of dna length . 
 we expect to be able to tune the rectification properties of the pores as well as the effective pore diameter as a function of external voltage . 
 we will also try to identify a particular ratio of dna length and pore diameter under which dna - modified nanopores exhibit spontaneous openings and closings of the pore similar to biological voltage - gated channels .","

Abstract: The use of single nanopores in biosensors and for studying molecular interactions has gained much attention. By modifying the geometry and surface chemistry of these nanopores, we can create devices that control the transport of molecules and ions in solution. Here, we present our findings on the effect of single-stranded DNA on conically shaped nanopores and how it can tune the opening diameter for regulating transport.

Research and Discussion: Our research reveals that the presence of single-stranded DNA in the narrow opening of nanopores leads to a reduction in ionic current flow, which decreases with decreasing ionic strength. This is due to the DNA molecules occluding the pore opening, with their conformation depending on the concentration of salt in the background electrolyte. This further highlights the importance of tuning the nanopore surface to regulate transport.

Results and Conclusion: By attaching flexible polymers to the nanopore walls, we were able to create a system with tunable opening sizes, allowing for the regulation of transport for both neutral and charged species. The extent of blockade by DNA in our experiments was explained by the ionic strength dependence of the persistence length of the molecules. This research provides valuable insights into the potential of nanopore devices for biosensing and studying molecular behavior in confined volumes."
"skin is the largest sensory organ of the body and is densely equipped with highly specialized sensory nerve endings capable of sensing a wide range of sensory stimuli such as  light touch  mechanical pressure  temperature  itch  and pain . 
 these cutaneous sensory afferents can be distinguished by many morphological  anatomical  electrophysiological  and molecular criteria ( liu and ma  2011  owens and lumpkin  2014 ) . 
 for example  based on their cell body size  degree of myelination  and axonal conduction velocity  cutaneous fibers can be split into a  a  or c - fibers ( abraira and ginty  2013  bessou and perl  1969  li et  al .  2011  smith and lewin  2009  zimmermann et  al .  2009 ) . 
 they can be split into free nerve endings  found both in glabrous and hairy skin where they are embedded between the keratinocytes of the epidermis  and a particular population of c - unmyelinated fibers  found exclusively in hairy skin where they form longitudinal lanceolate endings around hair follicles ( delfini et  al . 
  2013  li et  al .  2011 ) or terminate in large arborizations similar to c - fiber tactile afferent receptive fields ( liu et  al .  2007  
 cutaneous free nerve endings are tuned to respond to itch - inducing compounds and pain - evoking thermal  mechanical  and chemical stimuli ( zimmermann et  al .  2009 ) . 
 mrgprd free nerve endings belong to a subset of non - peptidergic nociceptors that convey noxious mechanical and -alanin - induced itch stimuli ( cavanaugh et  al . 
  2009  liu et  al .  2012 )  whereas c - low - threshold mechanoreceptors ( c - ltmrs ) have been proposed to contribute to light touch under normal conditions ( bessou et  al . 
  1971  douglas and ritchie  1957  johansson et  al .  1988  
 lken et  al .  2009  maruhashi et  al .  1952  
 olausson et  al .  2002  seal et  al .  2009  zotterman  1939 ) and to touch hypersensitivity after injury ( delfini et  al . 
  2013  liljencrantz et  al .  2013  seal et  al .  2009 ) . 
 our knowledge of the molecular contents that contribute to the functional specialization of these diametrically different subpopulations of cutaneous afferents is still at its infancy . in a recent study ( gaillard et  al .  2014 ) 
  we identified a novel g inhibitory interacting protein ( ginip ) that marks two distinct subsets of non - peptidergic neurons : the cutaneous free nerve endings mrgprd neurons ( dong et  al . 
  2001 ) and the v - glut3-  th-  and tafa4-expressing c - ltmrs ( delfini et  al .  2013  li et  al .  2011  seal et  al .  2009 ) . here  we took advantage of the ginip mouse model in combination with isolectin b4 ( ib4 ) cell surface staining and fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( facs ) . 
 we succeeded to purify three distinct populations of drg neurons and subjected their respective total rna contents to rna deep - sequencing technology ( rna - seq ) . 
 as expected  ginip / ib4 neurons showed a remarkable enrichment in mrgprd transcripts and ginip / ib4 neurons revealed a striking enrichment of the three known markers of c - ltmrs : tafa4  th  and vglut3 . 
 deeper comparison of the rna - seq data revealed distinct transcriptional signatures between mrgprd - expressing neurons and c - ltmrs that were further confirmed by in  situ hybridization analysis of over 100 genes . 
 most importantly  in addition to providing the transcriptional signatures of two categories of primary sensory neurons  our study expands the molecular characterization of c - ltmrs and suggests that this particular subset of primary sensory neurons shares many molecular features of ltmrs . as a functional readout  we used electrophysiological recording to unravel the specific and exclusive functional expression of the low - voltage - gated ca channel cav3.3 in c - ltmrs  where it very likely plays a key role in shaping their functional specialization . 
 in a recent study  we generated a mouse model that expresses the fluorescent protein m - cherry from the ginip locus ( gaillard et  al .  2014 ) . 
 double - labeling experiments using anti - ginip antibody in combination with ib4 staining showed that drg neurons can be split into four distinct categories : ginip / ib4 ; ginip / ib4 ; ginip / ib4 ; and ginip / ib4 neurons . 
 the ginip / ib4 double - positive ( dp ) population corresponds to the cutaneous free nerve endings mrgprd neurons ( figures 1a and 1b )  the ginip / ib4 population corresponds to tafa4-expressing c - ltmrs ( figures 1a and 1b )  the ginip / ib4 population contains the 20% remaining ib4 neurons ( figure  1a )  and the ginip / ib4 double negative ( dn ) neurons represents a heterogeneous population of neurons composed of peptidergic nociceptors  a subset of ret neurons and trkb and trkc neurons ( figure  1a ) . 
 as ginip mouse model allows high - fidelity expression of m - cherry in ginip neurons  we sought to combine live m - cherry fluorescence with ib4 cell surface staining and facs to purify the four categories of drg cells ( figures 1c and 1d ) . 
 neurons with a cell body size above 70  m were eliminated by filtering the suspension  and axonal debris was removed by using a percoll gradient . 
 negative gating was used to exclude dead or dying cells that incorporated sytox blue dye and cells that were autofluorescent in v500 channel ( figures 1c and s1 ) . 
 next  we gated on m - cherry - positive and m - cherry - negative cells that we further subdivided into ib4 and ib4 subsets ( figures 1c and s1 ) . 
 facs - sorted ib4 and ib4 m - cherry - positive neurons gave rise to expected proportions of cells : about two - thirds were ib4 ( corresponding to ginip / ib4 ) and the remaining one - third was ib4 ( corresponding to ginip / ib4 ; figure  1d ) . 
 the m - cherry / ib4 subset was excluded from the transcriptional analysis  because it was highly contaminated by cd31 ( pecam)-expressing endothelial cells  consistent with ib4 binding on this cell type ( data not shown ) . for the remaining three sorted samples ( hereafter called dp for the ginip / ib4  c - ltmrs for the ginip / ib4  and dn for ginip / ib4 )  we first confirmed by rt - pcr the accurate expression of ginip and m - cherry transcripts ( figure  s2b ) and then extended the purity evaluation by analyzing the expression of mrgprd  tafa4  trka  and trpv1 in each sorted sample ( figure  s2c ) . as expected  
 mrgprd transcripts were highly detected in the dp sample but low in the two others  whereas tafa4 expression was high in c - ltmrs . 
 trka and trpv1 transcripts were enriched in the dn sample  consistent with the enrichment in peptidergic nociceptors in the dn fraction ( figure  s2c ) . 
 high - quality rna ( figure  s2a ) was extracted from the three purified populations of neurons  and their respective transcriptional profiles were generated using rna - seq . 
 after one round of rna amplification  libraries were built in biological duplicate and sequenced in 100-bp paired - end cycles using the illumina hiseq2000 system with sbs technology . 
 image analysis and base calling were performed using the hiseq control software and rta component from illumina . 
 this approach yielded between 40 and 50 millions of reads that were further submitted to sequence mapping on mouse reference genome mm10 with casava 1.8.2 software . 
 after removal of contaminants ( 28s  18s  and 5s rrna ; mitochondrial chromosomes ; phix ; illumina controls ; and illumina adaptors )  reads mapping to multiple splicing positions  and reads with no match  we obtained between 32 and 42 millions of reads that were used for the generation of the raw data file ( table s1 ) . among the first - ranked genes in the raw data 
 file  we found genes known to be related to structural organization of neurons such as tuba1a  prph  sncg  and mtap1b ( table s2 ) . 
 all these genes exhibited strong expression in the three sorted samples  as they generated at least 50000 reads ( table s2 ) . 
 accordingly  they were highly and broadly expressed in drg neurons in allen - brain atlas database . 
 interestingly  genes associated with cellular stress such as hsp90ab1 and fos were also highly expressed in all samples  very likely due to the cell dissociation and facs process ( table s2 ) . 
 most importantly  quick analysis of the reads per kilobase per million of reads ( rpkm ) generated for genes expected to be enriched in each sorted subpopulation revealed high enrichment of mrgprd and p2rx3 in the dp subset  th and tafa4 in c - ltmrs  and cgrp and sp in the dn neurons ( figure  1e )  providing the first proof of concept of the successful outcome of our experimental paradigm . to identify genes that were preferentially enriched in one sample 
  we carried a pairwise comparative analysis ( 2-fold enrichment ; p  < 0.01 ) after libraries normalization with the trimmed mean of m values method ( tmm ) ( provided by edger statistical package ) . 
 then  for each subset  we extracted the list of genes that were upregulated in one subset as compared to the two others . 
 we found 486 genes enriched in dp subset  549 in c - ltmrs  and 2916 in dn subset ( tables s3  s4  and s5 ) . 
 these genes encode a variety of molecules including ion channels  receptors  signaling molecules  and previously uncharacterized genes . because not all neuronal subsets were included in our facs strategy and 
 because facs of acutely dissociated neurons may induce cellular stress that impacts on gene expression  the only follow - up strategy that could be employed to validate the specificity of our data sets was in  situ hybridization ( ish ) approach on fixed adult drg sections . knowing that we might miss genes that are expressed in subsets of our sorted neuronal subpopulations  we assumed that  below 1000 number of reads  transcripts detection by ish would be difficult to monitor . 
 therefore  we carried out a second pairwise comparative analysis by considering only the genes with values above 1000 reads ( figure  2a ) . as a result 
  we obtained 156 transcripts preferentially expressed in the dp subset  184 in c - ltmrs  and 784 in the dn population ( figure  2b ; tables s6  s7  and s8 ) . 
 we then monitored the expression of 48 dp-  68 c - ltmrs-  and 13 dn - enriched genes using ish followed by ginip immunostaining and ib4 labeling ( for the dp and c - ltmrs candidate genes ) or ginip and trka immunolabeling ( for the dn candidate genes ) . 
 these triple - labeling experiments provided an unambiguous and accurate expression pattern of each tested gene . 
 the 13 dn - enriched tested genes revealed two different expression patterns : genes mainly expressed in neurons and genes exclusively expressed in non - neuronal cells that harbor satellite and/or glial cell morphology ( figure  s3 ) . in agreement with our rna - seq data  genes expressed in neurons were excluded from dp neurons and c - ltmrs . 
 furthermore  we found 6/13 genes expressed in trka peptidergic neurons and others ( 2/13 ) excluded from this neuronal population  revealing the heterogeneity of the dn subset ( figure  s3 ) . because the aim of this study consisted at deciphering the transcriptional signatures that confer the functional specializations of mrgprd - expressing cutaneous free nerve ending and c - ltmrs 
  we analyzed the expression patterns of 48 dp - enriched genes and 68 c - ltmtrs - enriched genes . 
 in line with our rna - seq data sets  the 48 dp - enriched probes were highly expressed in the dp neurons and virtually excluded from c - ltmrs ( http://www.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/equipes/reynders/dp-ishlibrary.pptx ) . 
 however  the vast majority of the dp - enriched  genes displayed an additional expression pattern outside dp neurons . 
 12 genes showed some expression in few ginip / ib4 neurons  17 genes showed lower expression in discrete subsets of small ( 3/17 ) or medium - to - large size neurons ( 14/17 )  and 19 genes were expressed in broader neuronal subsets in addition to intense expression in dp neurons ( figures 2c2e ; dp - ish library ) . 
 the same strategy applied to c - ltmrs - enriched genes showed that all 68 tested genes were expressed in c - ltmrs and massively excluded from dp neurons ( http://www.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr/equipes/reynders/cltmrs-ishlibrary.pptx ) . 
 one striking feature of c - ltmrs - enriched genes is that the vast majority was also expressed in medium - to - large  size drg neurons  whereas only two were expressed in small neurons . 
 indeed  out of the 68 tested genes  six were specifically expressed in c - ltmrs  as they only marked a subset of ginip neurons that do not bind ib4 ( figures 3a3f ) . 
 quantitative analyses showed that ceacam10 is expressed in 71.2%  6.3% of c - ltmrs  wfdc2 in 73.4%  1.7%  cacna1i in 89.2%  5.9%  c1ql4 in 70%  1.8%  fbp2 in 19.9%  4.7%  and bok in 62.7%  6.4% of c - ltmrs ( figure  3 g )  further highlighting our previously suggested molecular heterogeneity of this particular class of neurons ( delfini et  al . 
 the remaining 60 genes could be split in three categories : 18 genes exhibited high expression in c - ltmrs but also marked a discrete subset of large - diameter neurons  23 genes showed equal levels of expression in c - ltmrs and in  large - diameter neurons  and 19 genes exhibited a very high enrichment in larger - diameter neurons and a discrete expression in c - ltmrs ( figures 4a4c ; cltmrs - ishlibrary ) . 
 because 88% of c - ltmrs - enriched genes displayed an additional expression preferentially in large - diameter neurons  we sought to unravel the molecular identity of these neurons . 
 to do so  we performed double ish using nf200 antisense probe in combination with selected c - ltmrs - enriched probes followed by trka immunolabeling . 
 this triple - staining experiment showed that all the selected probes were massively excluded from trka peptidergic neurons and expressed in subsets of nf200 neurons ( figure  s4 ) . knowing that nf200 is a hallmark of proprioceptors and ltmrs ( bourane et  al .  2009  li et  al . 
  2011  luo et  al .  2009  wende et  al .  2012 )  these data suggest that c - ltmrs share some molecular features of ltmrs . 
 mrgprd - expressing neurons and c - ltmrs exhibit fundamental differences both at anatomical and functional levels . 
 however  little is known about the molecular contents that instruct their respective functional specializations . 
 in line with this  we pooled dp and c - ltmrs - enriched genes according to their biological functions by searching for statistically over - represented associations with gene ontology ( go ) terms  using gorillla database ( figures 5  6  and s5 ) . 
 this analysis yielded  respectively  20 and 33 functional annotations for dp and cltmrs . 
 dp neurons exhibited a high enrichment in g - protein - coupled receptors as well as in transcripts encoding signaling molecules  such as gna14  gna1  gnaq  plcb3  prkca  prkcd  and prkcq ( figures 5a and s5a ; table s9 )  whereas c - ltmrs exhibited a striking enrichment in transcripts associated with voltage - gated ion channel activity ( figures 6a and s5b ; table s10 ) . 
 detailed analysis of genes associated with g protein receptor binding and signal transducer activity led to the identification of  two transcripts encoding for g - protein - coupled receptors  namely the angiotensin receptor type 1a ( agtr1a ) and the prostaglandin receptor d2 ( ptgdr ) ( figure  5a ) . 
 our ish experiments showed that agtr1a is expressed in dp neurons  but not in c - ltmrs or other subsets of drg neurons ( figure  5b )  whereas ptgdr was found at higher intensity in dp neurons compared to c - ltmrs and large - size neurons ( figure  5c ) . 
 in addition to gpcrs  go analysis revealed a striking enrichment of transcripts encoding signaling molecules in dp neurons  including gna14  gna1  gnaq  plcb3  prkca  prkcd  and prkcq ( table s9 ) . 
 our in  situ screen showed that all these transcripts were highly expressed in dp neurons and virtually absent in c - ltmrs ( figures 5d5 g ) . 
 the restricted enrichment of such number of signaling molecules likely endows dp neurons with the molecular machinery required to sense and transduce injury - induced pain hypersensitivity . regarding c - ltmrs  one of the most striking observations with respect to the go analysis was the high enrichment in transcripts associated with voltage - gated ion channel activity . 
 other physiologically pertinent functional annotations encompass substrate - specific channel  ion transmembrane transporter  and g - protein - coupled receptor activities ( figures 6a and s5b ) . 
 voltage - gated ion channels included potassium channels ( kcnq2  kcnj12  kcnv1  kcna2  and kcna4 )  sodium channels and associated beta subunits ( scn1a  scn1b  scn3b  scn4b  scn7a  and scn8a )  and low - voltage activated calcium channels ( cacna1h and cacna1i ; figures 6a and s5b ; table s10 ) . 
 ish screen showed that cacna1i is specifically expressed in c - ltmrs ( figure  3c ) and kcnj12 and cacna1h are expressed in c - ltmrs as well as in some large - diameter neurons but excluded from dp neurons ( figures 6b and 6c ) . 
 scn4b and scn8a exhibited low expression in c - ltmrs  very high expression in myelinated large neurons  and no detectable signal in dp neurons ( c - ltmrs - ish library  slides 67 and 68 ) . 
 the combinatorial enrichment of such channels in c - ltmrs is likely to explain the tonic and repetitive firing properties of this particular class of neurons ( delfini et  al . 
 interestingly  substrate - specific channels / ion transmembrane transporters encompassed anoctamin 6 ( ano6 ) and solute carrier 17a2 ( slc17a2 ) . 
 ano6 is part of outwardly rectifying chloride channels ( martins et  al .  2011 )  and slc12a7 encodes for the k / cl co - transporter kcc4 ( boettger et  al .  2002 )  suggesting that both channels could be involved in membrane excitability . 
 in situ analysis of ano6 and slc12a7 showed that both transcripts were expressed in c - ltmrs  but not in dp neurons  and exhibited some expression in large drg neurons ( figures 6d and 6e ) . 
 gpcr - activity - related transcripts were also represented in go analysis of c - ltmrs data set  including cholecystokinin receptor a ( cckar ) and purinergic receptor y1 ( p2ry1 ) . 
 our ish data showed that both cckar and p2ry1 transcripts were highly enriched in c - ltmrs  totally excluded from dp neurons  and displayed expression in some large - diameter neurons ( figures 6f  6 g  and s4b ) . 
 together  our data provide a functional description of sets of  genes differentially expressed in dp versus c - ltmrs . 
 the differential expression of such clusters of genes likely contributes to differences in signal transduction  intrinsic membrane excitability  and the firing properties of c - ltmrs and mrgprd neurons . 
 our data also provide a predictive basis for deciphering the mechanisms by which specific external stimuli and downstream - associated signaling pathways fine - tune the activity of these two neuronal subsets . 
 our rna - seq data revealed high enrichment of cacna1h ( cav3.2 ) and cacna1i ( cav3.3 ) in c - ltmrs . 
 our ish showed that transcripts encoding both channels were expressed in c - ltmrs with cav3.3 being exclusively expressed in this neuronal subset ( figures 3e and 7a ) . to explore whether both channels were functional in c - ltmrs  we used whole - cell patch - clamp recordings on primary culture of heterozygous m - cherry - expressing neurons in the presence of alexa 488 ib4 live staining to distinguish between c - ltmrs and dp neurons . in ionic conditions designed to isolate calcium currents  current - voltage relationships showed inward low - voltage - activated ( lva ) and high - voltage - activated ( hva ) currents in all recorded c - ltmrs soma  confirming the systematic presence of t - type currents in these neurons ( figures 7b and 7c ) . 
 in sharp contrast  dp neurons did not express any lva current in agreement with the absence of cav3 transcripts in this population ( figures 7b and 7c ) . to test whether cav3.2 and cav3.3 were functional in c - lmtrs  we took advantage of cav3.2 high sensitivity to nickel ions ( ni ) ( lee et  al .  1999 ) . 
 blockade of t - type calcium currents in c - ltmrs by low concentration of ni ( 30  m ) revealed a ni - insensitive current with slow kinetics of activation and inactivation typical of cav3.3 channel ( figure  7d ; chemin et  al .  2002 ) . 
 in contrast  the ni - sensitive fraction obtained by subtraction revealed faster kinetics with an explicit criss - cross pattern typical of cav3.2 ( figure  7d ) . to date  zinc ( zn ) is the only available pharmacological tool that interferes with the gating kinetics of cav3.3 ( cataldi et  al .  2007  traboulsie et  al .  2007 ) . 
 after blockade of cav3.2-like fraction by ni  subsequent application of zn ( 100  m ) slowed down the remaining native cav3.3-like current with a prominent slowing of the deactivation ( figure  7e ) . 
 analysis of several c - ltmr soma revealed that cav3.3-like currents account for a third of the total amplitude of c - ltmrs t - type calcium currents ( figure  7f ) . 
 the dramatic slowdown of the deactivation kinetics by zn further shows that cav3.3 is a unique feature in the portfolio of ion channels specific to c - ltmrs ( figure  7 g ) . to test whether these two t - type calcium channel isoforms impact c - ltmr excitability  we performed current - clamp experiments . in neurons  
 t - type calcium channels are well known to generate rebound low - threshold spikes ( lts ) following a transient hyperpolarization . in c - ltmrs  
 membrane depolarization triggered small lts when the membrane is held at more and more negative values ( figure  7h ) . 
 inhibition of cav3.2 by ni ( 50  m ) did not significantly alter lts and action potential ( ap ) threshold  whereas potentiation of cav3.3 by zn ( 100  m ) increased both lts amplitude and kinetics ( figure  7h  inset ) . 
 this resulted in an increased excitability with a lowering of ap activation threshold crowning the potentiated lts ( figures 7h and 7i ) . in two cells out of ten  the sole application  of zn at the resting potential of c - ltmrs elicited a depolarization sufficient to trigger spontaneous ap trains ( figure  7j ) . 
 application of ni in these conditions did not produce any change in membrane potential ( not shown ) . to exclude trpa1 channel contribution  
 also activated by zn  these experiments were performed in  presence of trpa1 blocker  hc030031 ( 10  m ) . 
 together  our electrophysiological data nicely corroborate the rna - seq  and  the ish expression data  demonstrating that both cav3.2 and cav3.3 channels are concomitantly expressed in c - ltmrs and that both channels are absent in the free nerve ending mrgprd - expressing neurons . 
 in this study  we used our recently generated mouse model in  which the cutaneous mrgprd - expressing neurons and c - ltmrs were genetically marked by the m - cherry protein  in combination with ib4 live staining followed by cell sorting and rna deep sequencing to gene profile three categories of primary sensory neurons : the free nerve ending mrgpd - expressing neurons  c - ltmrs  and a heterogeneous population of drg cells that  neither bind ib4 nor are labeled by the m - cherry protein . 
 we provide a digital  measure of the presence and prevalence of transcripts from known and previously unknown genes for each of the three neuronal subsets . 
 because the dn population is composed of a variety of neuronal subsets and glial cells  dn data set was used to identify genes specifically enriched in the free nerve ending mrgprd - expressing neurons and those specifically enriched in c - ltmrs . 
 this analysis yielded 156 genes specifically enriched in the dp neurons and 184 in c - ltmrs . 
 these genes encode a variety of molecules including ion channels  receptors  signaling molecules  and previously uncharacterized genes . a major concern with any gene - profiling experiment is the follow - up procedure . 
 which genes should one pursue  and what should be done with these lists of genes ? 
 the answer to this question was motivated by our objectives to expand the molecular characterization of c - ltmrs and to identify the combinatorial expression of the key genes that shape the functional specialization of the free nerve endings mrgprd neurons and c - ltmrs . 
 mrgprd neurons are required for acute and injury - induced mechanical pain as well as for the sensation of itch ( cavanaugh et  al . 
 2012  shields et  al .  2010 )  whereas c - ltmrs were postulated to convey light touch under physiological conditions and mechanical and chemical pain after injury ( abraira and ginty  2013  delfini et  al .  2013  
 our rna - seq data in combination with ish and gene ontology analysis revealed a great number of genes expressed in dp neurons  but not in c - ltmrs  and vice versa  reflecting their anatomical and functional differences . 
 indeed  dp neurons showed very high enrichment in genes encoding gpcrs and signaling molecules in addition to a selective expression of three isoforms of the protein kinase c family . 
 the enrichment of such receptors and signaling molecules is in agreement with the involvement of dp neurons in acute and injury - induced mechanical pain and itch ( cavanaugh et  al . 
 we show that dp neurons express high levels of agtr1a and ptgdr  suggesting that the pro - nociceptive effect of their respective agonists  angiotensin ii and prostaglandin d2  likely occurs through dp neurons activation . 
 pgd2 has been shown to enhance neuronal excitability by increasing the amplitude of ttx - sensitive currents ( ebersberger et  al .  2011  nakae et  al .  
 2005 )  and continuous perfusion of angiotensin ii enhanced tactile and thermal hypersensitivity in the setting of nerve injury via the activation of agtr1a ( pavel et  al .  2013 ) . 
 furthermore  dp neurons exclusively express mrgprd  a gpcr that is activated by -alanine  but not histamine ( liu et  al .  2012 )  suggesting that dp neurons are part of a histamine - independent itch neural circuit and that these neurons can be targeted for treating clinical itch that is resistant to antihistamines . 
 c - ltmrs on the other hand expressed different gpcrs than those expressed in dp neurons such as cckar and the metabotropic gq p2y1 receptor and showed a striking enrichment in voltage - gated channels including potassium channels ( kcnq2  kcnj12  kcnv1  kcna2  and kcna4 )  sodium channels and associated beta subunits ( scn1a  scn1b  scn3b  scn4b  scn7a  and scn8a )  and the low - voltage - gated calcium channels ( cacna1h and cacna1i ) . 
 it has been shown that cckar was restricted to 10% of neurons that do not overlap with peptidergic cgrp nociceptors ( broberger et  al .  2001 ) . 
 our rna - seq and ish data demonstrate that cckar is expressed in c - ltmrs and excluded from dp neurons . 
 cholecystokinin octapeptide  which in its sulfated form binds the gq/11-coupled cckar  is involved in regulation of a large variety of physiological functions among which opioid - induced anti - nociception ( suh et  al .  1995 ) . 
 electrophysiological studies in rat drg neurons have shown that activation of cckar evokes membrane depolarization  indicating that cckar mediates excitatory responses ( ma et  al .  2006 ) . 
 psychophysiological studies in human using cholecystokinin octapeptide could lend new insights into the role of c - ltmrs in touch sensation under normal and pathological conditions . 
 c - ltmrs also exhibited high expression of the metabotropic gq p2y1 receptor  whereas dp neurons mainly expressed the ionotropic purinergic receptor p2x3  demonstrating that  in dp neurons  atp / adp compounds are sensed through p2x3  whereas in c - ltmrs  these signaling intermediates are likely detected though metabotropic gq p2y1 receptor . 
 our data also highlighted the specific and the functional enrichment of the lva t - type channels in c - ltmrs . 
 among the three t - type channels  we found cav3.2 and cav3.3 highly present in c - ltmrs  with cav3.3 being exclusively expressed in this particular class of neurons . 
 t - type currents with slow kinetics and resistance to nickel block have been described in a subset of small - sized rat drg and trigeminal neurons expressing slowly adapting mechano - activated currents ( coste et  al . 
 our rna - seq data in combination with ish and electrophysiological recordings provided a clear demonstration that cav3.3 is a specific marker of c - ltmrs and offers a new possible selective pharmacological target to  control c - ltmrs excitability in mice . 
 although zinc has plethoric effects  its use to investigate cav3.3 contribution to c - ltmr excitability shows specificity . 
 particularly  the slowing of lts kinetics is highly correlated to the massive changes in cav3.3 currents . in line with this  the depolarizing effects observed result  at least in part  from the persistent depolarizing zinc - modulated cav3.3 current . whereas the contribution of other zinc targets remains possible  
 trpa1 effect has been eliminated by the use of its specific blocker  and a possible inhibition of two pore potassium task3 channel ( kcnk9 ) is unlikely because the transcript is not present in c - ltmrs ( our study ; usoskin et  al .  2015 ) . 
 mechanistically  our findings suggest a substantial contribution of cav3.3 to rebound firing reminiscent of those observed in nuclear reticularis thalamic neurons that  like c - ltmr  express both cav3.2 and cav3.3 and with a prominent cav3.3 effect on burst firing ( astori et  al .  2011 ) . 
 finally  a recent elegant study using an unbiased large - scale single - cell rna sequencing revealed 11 molecularly distinct subsets of primary sensory neurons  including the th - expressing c - ltmrs population ( usoskin et  al .  2015 ) . 
 very interestingly  genes enriched in c - ltmrs in our study were similar to those upregulated in the th population described in the usoskin and colleagues study . 
 however  our ish experiments showed that the vast majority of c - ltmrs - enriched genes were also expressed in other neurons  preferentially in the nf200 neurons  further supporting our strategy to validate the specific expression of the identified enriched genes using ish approach . 
 given that the majority of c - ltmrs - enriched genes were also expressed in nf200 neurons and that nf200 is a hallmark of proprioceptive and a and a ltmrs ( abraira and ginty  2013 )  we postulate that c - ltmrs share many molecular features with some a and a ltmrs . in line with this hypothesis  
 studies of  the last few years demonstrated that c - ltmrs share many functional and anatomical features of some a and a ltmrs ( abraira and ginty  2013 ) . 
 c - ltmrs have been described to convey low - threshold mechanical stimuli ( bessou et  al .  1971  douglas and ritchie  1957  johansson et  al .  1988  
  1952  seal et  al .  2009  zotterman  1939 ) . 
 they are sensitive to skin indentation  respond to sustained mechanical stimuli with slow and intermediate adaptation rates  and form longitudinal lanceolate endings around hair follicles ( abraira and ginty  2013  delfini et  al .  2013  li et  al .  2011  lou et  al .  2013  
 cross comparison of our rna - seq data sets with those of the five nf subsets recently published by usoskin and colleagues ( usoskin et  al .  2015 ) will provide a comprehensive view of the molecular signatures of c - ltmrs and a and a ltmrs . in conclusion  data presented in this study provide a wealth of  information about the presence and prevalence of transcripts  from known and previously unknown genes in three categories of  primary sensory neurons  they highlight the differential expression of a great number of genes in two diametrically opposite classes of cutaneous afferents  the ish screen followed by immunostaining and ib4 binding led to the generation of two open - access libraries that allow monitoring the cellular distribution of 115 genes  they provide the first electrophysiological recording of a low - voltage - gated ca channel exclusively present in c - ltmrs  and they suggest that c - ltmrs share many molecular features with a and a ltmrs .

1) Abstract: This study examines the molecular mechanisms underlying the opposite sensations of pain and pleasant touch conveyed by cutaneous C and unmyelinated MRGPRD+ free nerve endings and C-LTMRs innervating hair follicles. The study utilized a mouse model and advanced sequencing technology to identify differentially expressed genes in these neuron subsets.

2) Research and Discussion: Using a combination of genetic marking, flow cytometry, and RNA-sequencing, the study identified 486 and 549 genes differentially expressed in MRGPRD+ neurons and C-LTMRs, respectively. Further validation using a triple-staining approach revealed 48 MRGPRD-enriched and 68 C-LTMR-enriched genes, including the exclusive expression of the Cav3.3 channel in C-LTMRs.

3) Results and Conclusion: This study significantly expands our understanding of the molecular characteristics of C-LTMRs and suggests a shared molecular profile with A and A low-threshold mechanoreceptors. The identification of Cav3.3 channel as a specific marker for C-LTMRs may provide new insights into the distinct functions of these neurons in conveying pain and pleasant touch sensations. "
"the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) is an organelle with crucial biosynthetic and signaling functions in eukaryotic cells . 
 the er is not only the major intracellular calcium ( ca ) storage organelle critically involved in ca homeostasis and ca mediated signaling pathways  but it also provides the environment for the synthesis  folding  and modification of proteins destined to be secreted or embedded in the plasma membrane ( reviewed in [ 1  2 ] ) . 
 moreover  the er is the major site for the biosynthesis of steroids  cholesterol  and lipids . 
 proper folding  maturation  and stabilization of the nascent protein in the er require the highly oxidizing and ca - rich er environment  which is essential for the diverse posttranslational and cotranslational modifications  including glycosylation and disulfide bridge formation  to which proteins are subjected after entering the er .   these processes are assisted and monitored by several resident chaperones and ca binding proteins  including the glucose - regulated proteins [ such as grp78 or bip ( immunoglobulin heavy - chain binding protein ) ]  calreticulin and calnexin  and several folding enzymes  such as the thioredoxin - like protein disulfide isomerase ( pdi ) . 
 pdi oxidizes cysteine residues in nascent proteins ( i.e.  oxidative folding ) resulting in formation of intra- and intermolecular disulphide bonds  while reduced pdi is in turn oxidized by the thiol oxidoreductase ero1 . 
 ero1 transfers reducing equivalents to molecular oxygen  generating stoichiometric amounts of h2o2 per newly formed disulphide  which is coupled with a depletion of the reduced gluthatione pool . 
 proteins that fail to adopt a correctly folded or native conformation  or a proper oligomeric assembly in case of multisubunit proteins  are retrotranslocated to the cytosol through a process known as er - associated protein degradation ( erad )  and further degraded by the 26s proteasome . 
 various physiological and pathological conditions  including hypoxia  er - ca depletion  oxidative injury  high - fat diet  hypoglycemia  and viral infections may cause an imbalance between er protein folding load and capacity  leading to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the er lumen  a condition referred to as  er stress  . 
 er stress sets in motion an evolutionary conserved and integrated signal transduction pathway known as the unfolded protein response ( upr ) . 
 the upr primarily aims at ameliorating the protein load on the er by coordinating the temporal shut down in protein translation along with a complex program of gene transcription to increase er folding capacity . 
 if this transcriptional program fails to reestablish proper er homeostasis  persistence in er stress induces cell death . 
 severe er stress can cause cell death  usually by activating intrinsic apoptosis . moreover  in order to clear the er from the accumulation of terminally misfolded protein aggregates that can not be degraded by the proteasome  the upr may upregulate the autophagy machinery [ 5  6 ] . 
 macroautophagy ( hereafter referred to as autophagy ) is a major lysosomal pathway for the in bulk degradation of cytoplasmic materials  including proteins and damaged organelles  characterized by the sequestration of entire portions of the cytoplasm by a double - membrane bounded vacuole called the autophagosome [ 7  8 ] . in spite of its role as a self - digestion mechanism  autophagy is mainly activated to protect against cell death . 
 however  just like in the case of the upr  stimulation of autophagy can under certain circumstances be required to activate the cell death machinery . 
 although both the upr and autophagy can function independently from each other  recent reports show that they may be interlinked and share the functional duality of exerting both a cytoprotective ( under basal or metabolic stress conditions ) and cytocidial activity ( after acute cellular damage ) . 
 tumor cells are bathed in a hostile microenvironment and confronted with chronic metabolic stress conditions that favor the activation of adaptive mechanisms  such as the upr and autophagy [ 10  11].moreover  certain promising anticancer regimens have been shown to activate concomitantly er stress and autophagy in cancer cells ( see section 4 ) . the molecular link between the upr and the autophagic response to er stress  and how these stress pathways influence therapeutic outcome  remain largely undefined  making this topic a very important area for future research in cancer therapy .   here 
  we review the molecular mechanisms underlying the emerging connections between the upr and autophagy pathways  and discuss their potential implications in the context of anticancer therapy . 
 the unfolded protein response in mammalian cells is governed by three transmembrane er stress sensors  namely perk ( pkr - like er kinase )  ire1 ( inositol requiring enzyme 1 )  and atf6 ( activating transcription factor 6 )  which are kept in an inactive state by binding to the er chaperone bip  preventing their oligomerization - induced activation . when er homeostasis is perturbed  accumulating misfolded proteins become progressively bound to bip  titrating away bip from interaction with these transmembrane signaling proteins . upon deinhibition and homodimerization 
 these er sensors activate a complex er - to - nucleus signaling pathway that transmits information across the er membrane to an extensive gene - expression program mediated by the activation of downstream transcription factors . the genetic program activated by the upr results in upregulation of the folding machinery along with an expansion of the er lumen and enhanced degradation of terminally misfolded proteins through erad . 
 additional mechanisms include a general translational shutdown as well as the degradation of a select group of secretory mrnas and proteins that are delayed at the translocon  a process also known as pre - emptive quality control . 
 the mechanisms by which upr induction coupled with the failure in reestablishing the er folding capacity leads to cell death and the requirement of upr signaling in autophagy stimulation  are still unsettled questions . 
 furthermore  recent studies have revealed that the er serves as a subcellular platform for the formation of signaling complexes comprising molecular elements of the upr  bcl-2 family members ( both pro- and antiapoptotic ) ( reviewed in )  and perhaps regulators of autophagy .    in the following sections we will discuss current knowledge on the main signaling pathways emanating by each branch of the upr along with their downstream targets ( figure 1 ) . 
 ire is expressed in all cell types and tissues  whereas expression of ire1 is primarily restricted to the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract [ 14  15 ] . 
 ire1 is a type i transmembrane protein with an n - terminal luminal sensor domain and a c - terminal cytosolic effector region that contains both kinase and endoribonuclease ( rnase ) domains . in cells undergoing er stress  oligomerization of ire1 results in trans - autophosphorylation and activation of the rnase domains which excise a 26  nt sequence from xbp1u ( unspliced xbp1 )  producing mature xbp1s mrna ( spliced xbp1 ) . 
 xbp1s encodes an active leucine zipper ( bzip ) transcription factor xbp1s that regulates the transcription   of several genes involved in er quality control mechanisms  er / golgi biogenesis  as well as erad components [ 1822 ] and as recently revealed  also genes involved in redox homeostasis and oxidative stress responses . 
 consistent with this  xbp1 deficient cells were found to be more susceptible to exogenous agents causing oxidative stress  such as h2o2 and parthenolide  concomitant with a reduced expression of several antioxidant enzymes including catalase and thioredoxin ( trx1 ) . 
 overexpression of xbp1 restored catalase expression and reduced ros generation after h2o2  thus implicating a protective role for xbp1 in oxidative stress . 
 intriguingly  this antioxidant effect was mediated by xbp1u ( i.e.  the protein encoded by the unspliced xbp1 mrna )  whereas xbp1s ( i.e.  the product of ire1 activation ) failed to induce changes in catalase expression in response to ros or following er stress  thus underscoring that ire1 activity is dispensable . 
 although the molecular mechanism underlying the differential function of the unspliced ( xbp1u ) and spliced ( xbp1s ) products of xbp1 is still elusive- and may involve the binding and regulation of selected targets dependent on their relative abundance in different cell types   this study highlights a new role for xbp1 in ros signaling  independent of ire1 rnase activity . 
 although ire1 displays intrinsic kinase activity  there are no other substrates known thus far than ire1 itself . however  prolonged activation of ire1 is capable to transmit a map kinase activation cascade . 
 it has been shown that ire1 can serve as a molecular platform for the recruitment of the adaptor protein tnf - receptor associated receptor 2 ( traf2 )  an e3 ubiquitin ligase  which leads to the activation of apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 ( ask1 )  a map3k of the jnk / p38 mapk pathway [ 25  26 ] . 
 depending on the cellular context  activation of jnk can either allow the cells to adapt to er stress by initiating autophagy   or  as discussed further  promote apoptosis in response to persistent or irrecoverable er stress . 
 like ire1  perk is a type i transmembrane protein with a luminal sensing domain and a cytosolic kinase domain which becomes activated following dimerization . 
 the resulting transautophosphorylation induces a conformational change that enhances the affinity of perk for eif2 ( eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha ) . 
 phosphorylation of eif2 on ser51 by perk results in the rapid shut down of general translation  relieving the protein burden on the stressed er  while the concomitant loss of cyclin d1 arrests the er stressed cells in g1 . in addition  a recent study has shown that eif2 phosphorylation also regulates translation via inhibition of rrna synthesis  coordinately regulating translation and ribosome biogenesis during cellular stress . 
 paradoxically  this translational shutdown leads to the selective translation of the transcription factor atf4  a member of the bzip family of transcription factors . 
 the perk - eif2-atf4 axis regulates the expression of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport functions  antioxidant stress responses  and apoptosis . 
 in addition to eif2  perk also phosphorylates the nuclear factor - e2-related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) . 
 nrf2 is maintained inactive in a cytoplasmic complex with the microtubule associated protein keap1 ( kelch - like ech - associated protein 1 ) . 
 nrf2 phosphorylation promotes its dissociation from keap1  leading to the nuclear accumulation of nrf2  binding the antioxidant response element ( are ) in the promotor of genes encoding detoxifying enzymes such as heme oxygenase 1 ( ho-1 ) . in line with these results 
  it was shown that nrf2 cells are more prone to er stress induced apoptosis . 
 likewise  perk cells  along with an impaired attenuation of protein synthesis  were found to mount a high amount of endogenous peroxides preceding apoptotic induction in response to agents causing perturbation of er functions . 
 interfering with ero1 blocked the increased ros production  thus providing a link between protein oxidation in the er and ros production during er stress . 
 this perk function was linked to the ability of atf4 to regulate the expression of genes involved in glutathione biosynthesis and antioxidant response . 
 these studies suggest that the perk branch of upr bifurcates in two parallel but integrated signaling pathways  perk - eif2-atf4 and perk - nrf2  with a key role in adaptation to oxidative stress  a metabolic consequence of biosynthesis and posttranslational oxidative processing in the er . both isoforms of atf6  atf6 and atf6  are present in all cell lines as type ii transmembrane er proteins . 
 release of bip does not cause atf6 oligomerization  but instead reveals a golgi localization sequence . 
 once translocated to the golgi  atf6 is cleaved at a juxtamembrane site by the site 1 and site 2 proteases ( s1p and s2p )  which are also involved in the cleavage of the er membrane transcription factor srebp ( sterol response element - binding protein ) [ 35  36 ] . 
 processed atf6 moves to the nucleus where it forms active homodimers or dimerizes with other bzip transcription factors like nf - y ( caat binding factor ) as well as xbp1s  to regulate transcription from atf / camp response elements ( cres ) and erses [ 38;39 ] . 
 interestingly  yoshida et al . found that xbp1u interacts directly with the active form of atf6 ( but not atf4 )  targeting it for proteasomal degradation which may provide a negative feedback loop to decrease xbp1 expression . 
 other transcriptional targets include proteins increasing er chaperone activity and degrading of er client proteins [ 37  39 ] . 
 although atf6 is neither essential for basal expression of er chaperones nor for embryonic or postnatal development  it plays an important role in recovery from acute er stress and adapting cells to chronic er stress . 
 additionally  a recent study shows that atf6 also contributes  in an xpb1s - independent manner  to lipid biogenesis and er expansion  an er stress response which was thought to be predominantly mediated by the irei pathway . 
 bcl-2 family proteins  which consist of proapoptotic multidomain proteins ( e.g.  bax  bak )  antiapoptotic multidomain proteins ( e.g.  bcl-2 )  and bh3-only proteins ( e.g.  bid  bim  bad )  are key regulators of mitochondrial apoptosis [ 41  42 ] . 
 they function as gatekeepers ( antiapoptotic ; bcl-2 ) or gatecrashers ( proapoptotic ; bax / bak ) of the outer mitochondrial membrane . 
 while the molecular mechanism underlying their mitochondrial action is still a matter of debate  it is becoming clear that bcl-2 family proteins can exert a tight control on apoptosis at different subcellular sites . 
 a constellation of er localized bcl-2 family members  including bax  bak  bik / nbk  and bcl-2  has been shown to be engaged in the control of er - ca homeostasis [ 4446 ] ( for an extensive review see [ 13  47 ] ) . 
 moreover  recent reports have identified bcl-2 members as vital regulators of upr sensor mechanisms and cellular fate following er stress . 
 for instance  atf6 negatively regulates bad proapoptotic activity by upregulating regulator of calcineurin 1 ( rcan1 )  an endogenous inhibitor of calcineurin ( protein phosphatase b ) . 
 bad dephosphorylation   allows its dimerization with antiapoptotic bcl-2 protein family members like bcl - xl  thus inhibiting their activity . 
 this mechanism underscores a prosurvival role for the genetic program activated by atf6  through the suppression of bad proapoptotic activity . 
 the proapoptotic multidomain proteins bax and bak can form a protein complex with the cytosolic domain of ire1  and this interaction has been shown to be essential for ire1 signaling . 
 genetic ablation of bax / bak in mice caused abnormal response to tunicamycin - induced er stress in the liver along with extensive tissue damage  decreased expression of xbp1  and reduced jnk activation . 
 furthermore  the requirement of bax / bak proteins for proper ire1 signaling was confirmed in mefs doubly deficient ( dko ) in these proapoptotic proteins . in a recent report klee et al 
 .   showed that reconstituting bak expression at the er membranes in dko cells is sufficient to reestablish ire1-traf2 activation and mitochondrial apoptosis ( as discussed further in section 2.3 ) instigated by   reticular forms of the bh3-only proteins bim and puma . 
 interestingly  the ire1 pathway activated by reticular bh3-only effectors was atypical as it did not lead to xbp1 splicing  likely because other arms of the upr required for the upregulation of xbp1 mrna levels  such as atf6  were not sufficiently activated . 
 however  an alternative and intriguing possibility could involve a differential regulation of the ire1 rnase activity ( required for xbp1 mrna splicing ) and ire1-traf2 complex formation ( required to activate proapoptotic jnk signaling ) by a different subset of proapoptotic proteins at the er membrane . 
 clearly  further studies are required to shed more light into the mechanisms regulating ire1 signal transduction . 
 recently  the er associated bax inhibitor-1 ( bi-1 )  an evolutionary conserved antiapoptotic protein  has been identified as a new player in the regulation of ire1 by bcl-2 family members and their modulators . 
 bi-1 can block bax - mediated apoptosis following er stress and other intrinsic stress signals by directly interacting with antiapoptotic bcl-2 family members and enhancing their antiapoptotic function . 
 bi-1 at the er was found to be capable to interact through its c - terminus domain with ire1 and to inhibit ire1 signaling  in vitro as well as in mice and flies  conferring increased resistance under conditions of mild er stress . 
 er stressed bi-1 deficient cells displayed ire1 hyperactivation along with an increased xbp1 mrna splicing and expression of xbp1s - dependent genes  thus unraveling a paradoxical role of bi-1 as inhibitor of the cytoprotective ire1 branch of the upr in mildly er stressed cells . 
 interestingly  in another study using human fibrosarcoma cells  overexpression of bi-1 inhibited ros production downstream er stress through the upregulation of ho-1  an effector of the perk - pathway ( as described previously ) . 
 bi-1 deficiency in mefs did not affect expression of ho-1  this raises the intriguing possibility that bi-1 may affect ire1 and possibly perk pathway in a cell type specific manner . 
 whereas further mechanistic studies are required to solve these discrepancies  these findings reveal how a subtle cross - talk between molecular sensors of upr and cell death regulators might affect the amplitude and function of the upr . 
 moreover  abundant evidence claims for a critical role of proapoptotic bcl-2 family proteins in the induction of apoptosis following er stress . when the initial cellular responses fail to restore er homeostasis  sustained er stress causes the upr to switch from an adaptive to a cell death pathway . however  the molecular elements of this switch are still elusive . with the exception of few components of the upr for which a dominant prosurvival ( i.e.  bip  ) or proapoptotic ( i.e.  chop  [ 56  57 ] ) role has been assigned by genetic studies  
 each apical upr sensor holds a dualistic role in propagating adaptive as well as a toxic signals .   for example  genetic deletion of perk or interference with eif2 phosphorylation impairs cell survival [ 58  59 ] and tumor growth under hypoxia  while artificially increasing perk activity increases cell survival . 
 however  lin et al .   have shown that sustained perk signaling is lethal  whereas the equivalent duration of ire1 signaling is not  suggesting that transition from protective to proapoptotic upr function involves a switch in ire1 signaling along with enduring perk activity . 
 the main effector of perk - mediated apoptosis is the proapoptotic transcription factor chop ( c / ebp homologous protein ; gadd153 ) which can be induced by atf4  atf6  as well as xbp1s . 
 however  the perk - eif2 branch appeared to be essential for chop upregulation as both perk  atf4 and eif2 ser51ala knock - in cells failed to induce chop during er stress [ 32  58  59 ] . 
 chop activity is also regulated translationally by the limited chop mrna lifetime   and posttranslationally by p38mapk phosphorylation  which enhances its proapoptotic activity [ 57  64 ] . 
 the latter mechanism may provide a point of convergence between the perk and ire1 signaling pathways since p38mapk is a downstream target of the ire1-traf2-ask1 signaling complex [ 25  26 ] . 
 genetic studies have shown that chop loss - of - function results in cytoprotection  whereas chop gain - of - function enhances sensitivity to a variety of stresses perturbing er function [ 56  65 ] . 
 chop mediated cell death entails the induction of a variety of genes that may potentiate apoptosis  including gadd34    ero1    bim  and trb3 ( tribbles homologue 3 ) . 
 gadd34 is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 ( pp1 ) that targets pp1 to dephoshorylate eif2  which promotes the resumption of protein synthesis . 
 if the protein folding capacity of the er has not been reestablished  a premature deinhibition of translation will increase client protein load in the er and may favor improper disulphide bond formation of unfolded proteins  thus amplifying the damage . in addition  elevated expression of ero1   by chop is thought to instigate hyperoxidizing conditions in the er [ 67  68 ] . 
 thus the perk - axis  which is involved in maintaining the redox state during er stress  as discussed before  has also the ability to turn into a prooxidant signal when the transcriptional program of chop is efficiently set in motion .   as suggested by a recent study wherein the stability of prosurvival and prodeath mrnas and proteins 
 was studied under conditions of mild or severe er stress  atf4-dependent prosurvival gene expression is likely to be more sustained when perk is activated transiently and to a limited extent . 
 in contrast  as a consequence of the intrinsic instability of the proapoptotic mrnas and proteins  the apoptotic program mediated by the atf4 target chop would be activated only when protective mechanisms fail and require a more sustained perk activation . 
 chop can also regulate the expression of a number of bcl-2 family proteins . by a yet unidentified mechanism 
  it suppresses the expression of the antiapoptotic bcl-2   while directly promoting the transcription of the proapoptotic bh3-only protein bim . 
 although it is clear that chop fulfills an important role in er stress induced apoptosis  the fact that perk and eif2 ser51ala knock - in cells are unable to induce chop yet are very susceptible to er stress [ 58  59 ] unravels the dual role of the perk axis in triggering both adaptive and proapoptotic processes . the increased sensitivity of perk deficient cells could be explained  at least in part  by the impaired activation of the prosurvival pi3k ( phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase)-akt signaling pathway which   has been shown to promote the expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins ( iaps )  thus conferring cellular resistance to er stress [ 70  71 ] . 
 an interesting molecular switch between the prosurvival and prodeath functions of the perk pathway could involve the human orthologue of the drosophila tribble protein ( trb3 )  a downstream transcriptional target of chop . 
 .   showed that trb3 knock down sensitized the cells to cell death during tunicamycin treatment . 
 remarkably  trb3 could downregulate its own induction by repressing chop / atf4 functions [ 72  73 ] . 
 a mechanism was proposed wherein trb3 exerts a negative feedback on chop during mild er stress  allowing the cell to adapt to er stress [ 72  73 ] . 
 in contrast  during severe or persistent er stress  induction of trb3 would be more robust  leading to apoptosis through a mechanism involving trb3-mediated inhibition ( dephosphorylation ) of akt [ 74  75 ] . 
 this feedback mechanism could facilitate er stress mediated apoptosis in severely er stressed cells that have successfully mounted proapoptotic threshold levels of chop . 
 similar to perk  ire1 signaling has also been implicated in promoting or impairing cell survival . 
 for instance  when unfolded proteins accumulate  artificially extending ire1 's rnase function led to enhanced survival [ 62  76 ] and the knock down of xbp1 impaired cell survival  [ 77  78 ] pointing to a general protective role for the ire1-xbp1 signaling during er stress . 
 however  in another report  ire1 overexpression in hek293 t cells led to its activation in the absence of er stress and subsequent cell death . as discussed before  ire1 has apparently gained signaling properties independent of xbp1 splicing  which are strongly dependent on interaction with bcl-2 proapoptotics and bcl2 modulators at the er membrane . 
 thus  ire1 can promote cell death by recruiting a traf2-ask1 complex leading to the activation of jnk and p38 mapk cascades [ 25  26 ] . 
 jnk  in turn  can exert its proapoptotic effect by activating certain bh3-only proteins  such as bim [ 79  80 ]  or by suppressing the antiapoptotic activity of bcl-2 . 
 the apoptotic pathway evoked after upr is still unclear  but mounting observations indicate that the mitochondrial pathway is heavily involved  since cells lacking bax and bak  or apaf-1 are resistant to apoptosis induction by different er stressors [ 44  82  83 ] . 
 moreover  as mentioned before  several bcl-2 family members localize at the er and regulate both calcium levels as well as signal transduction through the upr . 
 in addition to bim  other bh3-only proteins  such as noxa and puma  are transcriptionally activated  through p53-dependent   and independent mechanisms   depending on the type of er stressor  thus bridging er stress to bax / bak mediated mitochondrial membrane permeabilization . recently 
 klee and coworkers using bax / bak cells showed that bak targeted at the er membrane is sufficient to engage mitochondrial apoptosis when activated by bh3-only molecules puma and bim at the er  thus bypassing the need to be localized to the mitochondria . 
 reticular bak engaged an atypical ire-traf2 activation pathway  wherein the mobilization of ca facilitated persistent jnk activation . 
 intriguingly  er ca   release per se was not able to incite mitochondrial apoptosis unless bak was expressed at the reticulum  whereas it favored nonapoptotic cell death  as shown also in our previous study . whether this pathway has any role in normal cells expressing both mitochondrial and 
 er bax / bak still needs to be proven  however it can already be argued that jnk functions as a master regulator of both apoptosis and perhaps autophagy pathways after er stress .   thus all together 
 the emerging consensus is that the amplitude and the temporal activation of specific arms of the upr  along with the repertoire of signaling platforms formed at the er membrane ( upr interactome )  are crucial elements determining cellular fate following er stress . 
 proteasomal degradation and autophagy are the two main mechanisms that are in charge of protein clearance in the cell . unlike proteasomal degradation ( that digests soluble ubiquitin - conjugated proteins in a specific way )  autophagy can degrade both soluble and aggregated proteins [ 8  86 ] . 
 thus  during the autophagic process  entire cytoplasmic portions  including organelles and other cytoplasmic components  are engulfed within a double membrane vesicle designated autophagosome . 
 the maturation of these vesicles involves their fusion with lysosomes  which leads in turn to the degradation of the autophagosome components by the lysosomal degradative enzymes [ 8  86 ] . 
 as discussed below  a variety of stress signals such as nutrient starvation or treatment with different anticancer agents ( including those that induce er stress ) stimulate the autophagy process  which is nowadays considered as an essential cellular process participating in a number of physiological functions within the cell . 
 the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of autophagy have not been completely elucidated yet  although genetic and biochemical analyses performed during the last few years have identified several autophagy genes ( atg ) that participate in the regulation of this cellular process . 
 researchers working in the autophagy field have formally divided the autophagic process in several steps . 
 initiation of autophagy relies on the formation of an isolation membrane ( i m ) at the so - called preautophagosomal site . 
 the autophagy process ends with the fusion of the autophagosome and the lysosome  the digestion of the autophagosome content  and the release of the digested components back to the cytosol   [ 8  86 ] . in these sections 
  we will briefly summarize the mechanisms by which the different stages of autophagy are regulated . the normal rate of autophagy in the cell is low and therefore this cellular process only becomes activated in response to certain situations . 
 thus  exposure of the cell to an autophagic stimulus triggers a series of modifications in the autophagic machinery that allow the formation and elongation of the i m . 
 the precise origin of the i m in mammalian cells is still unknown  although it has been proposed that it could be either derived from de novo synthesized lipids or generated by vesicle budding from er  golgi apparatus  or endosomes 
 . the transmembrane proteins atg9 and vmp-1 [ 88  89 ] are required for autophagosome formation and it has been suggested that they could play a role in the transport of lipids to the i m as well as in the recruitment of additional proteins involved in the initiation of autophagy . 
 thus  the movement of atg9 from the trans - golgi location to the preautophagosomal site seems to be a crucial event in the initiation of autophagy [ 87  90 ] . 
 the relocation of the transmembrane protein atg9 to the autophagosome is thought to require activation of the complex formed by the proteins atg1  atg13  and atg17/fip200 .. the activity of the atg1 complex is modulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mtorc1 ) . 
 mtorc1 is a protein complex formed by mtor  raptor ( regulatory associated protein of mtor )  mlst8  and pras40 ( proline - rich akt substrate 40  kda )   that plays a central role in the control of protein synthesis  cell growth  and cell proliferation through the regulation of several downstream targets . 
 in addition  mtorc1 has been proposed to regulate autophagy by repressing the activity of the atg1-atg13-atg17/fip200 complex [ 9295 ] . 
 regulation of mtorc1 relies on the small g protein rheb ( ras homologue enriched in brain ) which ( through a still not completely elucidated mechanism ) activates mtorc1 . 
 the tuberous sclerosis proteins ( tsc1 and tsc2 ) have gtpase activating protein ( gap ) activity on rheb and therefore promote its inhibition . 
 hence  inactivation of tsc1/2 stimulates rheb and mtorc1 and inhibits autophagy .   as a result of its central position in the control of cellular homeostasis 
 one of the most important upstream regulators of mtorc1 is the prosurvival kinase akt  which phosphorylates and inactivates tsc2 as well as pras40 . 
 another important regulator of tsc2 is the amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) which phosphorylates tsc2 in a different residue than akt leading to activation of   tsc1/2  inactivation of rheb  and inhibition of mtorc1 . as discussed in the following sections  modulation of mtorc1 activity is one of the mechanisms by which er stress and autophagy become connected . 
 another important step in the initiation of autophagy is the generation of a specific pool of phosphatidylinositol-3-p ( pip3 ) at the autophagosome . in mammals  
 this event is catalyzed by the class iii phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( pi3k ) complex [ which consists of vps34 ( vacuolar protein sorting 34 ) and its regulatory protein p150 ( homolog to the yeast vps15 protein ) ] . 
 accumulation of pip3 seems to be crucial for the recruitment of autophagy proteins such as atg18/wipi-1 to the i m   which is important for atg9 trafficking and therefore for the initiation of the autophagic process . 
 in addition  other proteins such as matg2 and dfcp1 ( double fyve domain - containing protein 1 ) may also be regulated by pip3 and play a role in the regulation of the formation and elongation of the autophagosome . underlining the importance of pip3 in the early stage of autophagy  a specific phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase ( jumpy ) 
 importantly  other vps34-interacting proteins are required for autophagy including  vps30/atg6/beclin1  atg14 and autophagy / beclin-1 regulator 1 ( ambra-1 )  and uvrag . among the different partners of vps34 
 beclin-1 has a bh3-only domain that permits the interaction of this protein with the antiapoptotic proteins bcl-2 and bcl - xl . 
 different stimuli  including er stress  modulate the interaction between beclin-1 and bcl-2 family members ( see also the following sections ) which is considered an important mechanism of autophagy regulation . atg14 and uvrag are also interactors of vps34 although their presence in the class iii pi3k complex seems to be mutually exclusive [ 87  103  104 ] . 
 recent findings support that atg14 plays an important role in the early stages of autophagy activation in response to starvation . in any case  
 further research is still necessary to understand the complex lipid - protein and protein - protein interactions that regulate the formation of the i m . 
 the elongation of the initial autophagic membrane requires the participation of two ubiquitin - like protein conjugation systems which modify the autophagy proteins atg5 and atg8/lc3 . 
 thus  upon autophagy stimulation  atg5 is conjugated to atg12 . in this process atg12 
 is activated by the e1 activating enzyme atg7 and transferred to the e2-like protein atg10 . finally atg12 is attached to an internal lysine of atg5 in a process that does not seem to require an e3 ligase protein . 
 is cleaved by the protease atg4 ( which generates a glycine ct residue in atg8/lc3 ) . 
 then  the e1 enzyme atg7 activates atg8  which is transferred to the e2-like protein atg3 . 
 the last step in atg8/lc3 modification involves the conjugation of this protein to phosphatidylethanolamine ( pe )  a process that is facilitated by the e3-like activity of the atg12-atg5 conjugate [ 105  106 ] . 
 upon autophagy induction  most of atg8/lc3 becomes lipidated and associates with the autophagosome  which is widely used to monitor activation of autophagy by immunofluorescence   [ 8  86  107 ] . 
 the atg16l and atg8/lc3 complexes play a crucial role on the modification of the autophagosomal membrane and therefore in the elongation and closure of the autophagosome . 
 the last step in the autophagic process is the fusion of the autophagosome with lysosomes . 
 the canonical machinery of vacuole membrane fusion seems to participate in the regulation of this process [ 87  90 ] . 
 thus  the lysosomal protein lamp2 and the small gtpase rab7 have been implicated in autophagosome - lysosome fusion in mammalian cells . 
 nevertheless  many additional proteins including those belonging to the rab and soluble n - ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors family ( snare ) are believed to play an important role in the autophagosome - lysosome fusion process [ 8  86 ] . 
 the lysosomal degradation of the autophagosomal content relies on several lysosomal hydrolases including cathepsins b  d  and l. the final outcome of the activation of the autophagy program is highly dependent on the cellular context and the strength and duration of the stress - inducing signals . 
 thus  besides its role in cellular homeostasis  autophagy can be a form of programmed cell death or play a cytoprotective role  for example in situations of nutrient starvation [ 108  109 ] . 
 accordingly  autophagy plays a dual role in cancer . on one hand  this cellular process may help to overcome the stress evoked by the lack of nutrients and oxygen at the initial steps of tumorigenesis . on the other hand 
  autophagy has been proposed to play a tumor suppressor function by providing the minimal supply of atp required for dna repair  preventing oxidative stress and reducing intratumoral necrosis and local inflammation [ 110113 ] . moreover  different anticancer treatments activate autophagy in tumor cells  which has been proposed to either enhance cancer cell death or act as a mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy [ 110115 ] . 
 different situations that induce er stress also lead to induction of autophagy . as discussed above  the er stress response 
 is activated to protect the cells from different alterations affecting this organelle . however  when the intensity or duration of the er damage can not be restored by this response  er stress can also lead to cell death . 
 likewise  autophagy can help cells to cope with er stress ( for instance contributing to the elimination of unfolded or aggregated proteins ) or participate in the mechanism of er stress - induced cell death [ 115  117119 ] . in this section 
 we will try to delineate some of the proposed mechanisms by which er stress and autophagy become connected under certain cellular situations ( figure 2 ) . 
 as described above  the accumulation of unfolded proteins triggers the upr thus promoting the inhibition of general protein synthesis as well as the increased translation of several transcription factors that enhance the expression of er stress genes   ( see the previous sections for further details ) . 
 evidence for a link between upr and autophagy was obtained from ectopic expression of polyglutamine ( polyq ) proteins . in these experiments  a dominant - negative form of perk or genetic substitution of serine 51 of eif2 by ala ( which prevents the phosphorylation of this protein ) prevented polyq protein - induced autophagy  strongly suggesting that perk - dependent eif2 phosphorylation plays an important role in the activation of autophagy in response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins . on the other hand 
  eif2 phosphorylation seems to be also important for autophagy as induced by other er stress - related or unrelated stimuli [ 75  120  121 ] . 
 it is important to bear in mind that perk is not the only protein kinase regulating eif2 phosphorylation ( see reference   for a review ) as double - stranded rna - activated protein kinase ( pkr ; activated in viral responses )  general control nonderepressible 2 ( gcn2 ; activated upon aminoacid starvation )  and heme - regulated inhibitor ( hri ; activated in heme depletion ) also phosphorylate eif2. accordingly  pkr - dependent eif2 phosphorylation modulates autophagy in response to viral infection . 
 likewise  the small heat shock 22  kda protein 8 ( hspb8 ) and its cochaperone bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 ( bag3 ) have been proposed to mediate mutated hungtingtin - induced eif2 phosphorylation and autophagy via gcn2 activation .   regarding the signalling pathways by which eif2 phosphorylation can modulate autophagy  kouroku and et al 
 showed that perk - eif2-dependent atg12 upregulation is required for induction of autophagy in response to polyq protein accumulation which suggests that controlling the expression of autophagy - related genes by eif2 downstream targets could be one of the mechanisms connecting both events . on the other hand  
 we have recently found that treatment of cancer cells with -tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc )  the active component of marihuana  activates autophagy via er stress and eif2 phosphorylation   ( an effect that is not mediated by perk  pkr  or gcn2  salazar  m. and velasco  g. unpublished observations ) . 
 our data indicate that induction of autophagy in response to thc treatment relies on the eif2 phosphorylation - dependent upregulation of the transcription factors p8  atf-4  and chop as well as of the pseudokinase trb3 ( four genes that had been previously identified as essential mediators of thc action in cancer cells [ 122  123 ] ) . 
 we also showed that an important step in the induction of autophagy is the inhibition of the akt / mtorc1 axis by the pseudokinase trb3   ( see below for additional details ) ( figure 2 ) . in any case  
 further research is still necessary to clarify the precise mechanisms by which eif2 phosphorylation regulates autophagy in response to different er stress signals . 
 activation of the ire1 arm of the er stress response has also been shown to regulate autophagy . 
 thus  treatment with tunicamycin or thapsigargin   or treatment with proteasome inhibitors   induced autophagy on an ire1-dependent manner . 
 the proautophagic actions of ire1 seem to rely on the ability of this protein to interact with the cytosolic adaptor traf-2 and activate jnk ) . of interest 
  jnk has been proposed to regulate autophagy through bcl-2 phosphorylation  which prevents this protein of interacting ( and inhibiting ) the essential autophagy regulator beclin-1 [ 99  124  125 ] . 
 in addition  jnk has been shown to control beclin-1 expression to regulate ceramide - induced autophagy . 
 as discussed above  beclin-1 is associated to the vps34 and plays a very important role in the regulation of autophagy ( see below ) ( figure 2 ) . 
 it is therefore conceivable that activation of the ire1/traf2/jnk arm of er stress may regulate autophagy through modulation of beclin-1 function and expression . 
 intriguingly  it has been recently shown that xbp-1 ablation increases autophagy and protects from the toxicity induced by the aggregates of the enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 in a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . 
 these observations suggest that the xbp-1 may play a different role than traf2/jnk on the regulation of autophagy by the ire1 arm of the upr . 
 er stress activation is frequently accompanied by calcium release into the cytosol which leads to the activation of several ca - regulated signalling pathways . 
 different agents ( including er stress inducers ) have been shown to produce an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration and activate autophagy . 
 one of the mechanisms connecting ca release from the er and autophagy is the stimulation of ampk . as explained above  several kinases regulate mtorc1 including ampk  which inhibits mtorc1 by activating tsc2 . 
 ampk is considered an important energy sensor that becomes activated upon atp cellular depletion or phosphorylation by different kinases . 
 three ampk upstream kinases have been identified to date : lkb1  ca / calmodulin - dependent kinase kinase  ( cacmkk )  and transforming growth factor - beta - activating kinase 1 ( tak1 ) . 
 jttel and coworkers showed that increases in cytosolic ca concentration upon treatment with different er stress inducers stimulate camkk  leading in turn to ampk activation  inhibition of mtorc1  and autophagy stimulation . 
 the same group has recently shown that trail - induced autophagy is also mediated by ampk  in this case through a mechanism that involves phosphorylation of ampk by tak1 and not by lkb1 or cam - kk . 
 these observations suggest that ampk may play an important role in the regulation of autophagy in response to different ca - dependent and independent stress signals . 
 another ca - activated kinase that regulates autophagy in response to er stress is the death associated protein kinase 1 ( dapk ) . 
 dapk is a ser / thr kinase that plays an important role as tumor suppressor due to its ability to promote apoptosis and autophagy . 
 thus  dapk - deficient mefs are less sensitive to er stress - induced autophagy than their wild - type counterparts . 
 activation of dapk upon er stress relies on the dephosphorylation of an inhibitory autophosphorylation site of the kinase by a pp2a phosphatase  which suggests that additional er stress - activated signals ( apart from ca release ) are required to stimulate the proautophagic activity of the kinase . regarding the mechanisms by which dapk regulates autophagy 
  it has been recently shown that dapk phosphorylates beclin-1 on the bh3-only domain preventing thus the interaction of this protein with bcl-2 [ 133  134 ] . 
 as p53 modulates autophagy through different mechanisms [ 112  136138 ]  this could be another way by which dapk could regulate autophagy in response to certain er stress stimuli . 
 the protein kinase c theta ( pkc ) has been also implicated in regulating autophagy in response to er stress in a calcium - dependent manner . 
 thus  knock - down of pkc ( but not inactivation of the upr signalling routes ) prevented autophagy as induced by acute er stress . in this study  
 inactivation of mtorc1  under the used concentrations of thapsigargin  thapsigargin were not observed  which suggests that different signalling routes may converge in the regulation of autophagy under er stress situations involving calcium mobilization . 
 another link between ca  er stress  and autophagy relies on the modulation of the inositol 145-trisphosphate receptor ( ip3r ) . 
 this receptor releases ca from er stores in response to different cellular signals  although it could also play additional functions derived from its ability to interact with different proteins  including members of the bcl-2 family . 
 inhibition of the ip3r with xestospongin b   or lithium - induced decrease of myo - inositol-145-triphosphate ( ip3 ) levels   promotes autophagy . 
 intriguingly  these effects seem to be independent of the ca mobilization function of ip3r . 
 thus  it has been recently shown that use of pharmacological inhibitors of the ip3r disrupts the interaction of this protein with beclin-1   which could be an additional way of regulating the pro - autophagic function of this protein . 
 further investigation is nevertheless necessary to clarify whether this mechanism participates in the activation of autophagy in response to er stress . as discussed for the case of er stress  autophagy 
 is currently considered a cell survival mechanism that  under certain cellular settings  can also promote cell death . 
 consequently  depending on whether pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy enhances or prevents cell death  activation of autophagy after er stress has been assigned respectively a cytotoxic [ 75  115  119  132  145147 ] or a protective [ 5  6  115  119  128 ] role . 
 it is worth noting that depending on the intensity of the stimulus  the cell type ( normal versus cancer cells )  and the cellular context  ( hypoxia  starvation  treatment with antitumoral agents  or presence of mutations ) the final outcome of autophagy activation could be different . 
 an important problem at the time of predicting whether induction of er stress will activate autophagy in a protective or cytotoxic way is our relative lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which autophagy regulates cell death . 
 thus  autophagy has been proposed to protect from apoptosis  operate as an alternative cell death mechanism ( e.g.  in cells that are defective in apoptosis )  or act upstream of apoptosis to activate this cellular process  ( reviewed in [ 133  148 ] ) . as discussed in the previous section  some of the key regulatory steps in the activation of autophagy upon stimulation of er stress ( such as mtorc1 inhibition or the interaction of beclin-1 with bcl-2 ) 
 can also receive signals derived from different inputs including those not directly related with er stress . 
 moreover  some of the regulatory proteins transmitting these signals such as akt  ampk  dapk  or jnk play also a major role in the modulation of cell survival independently of autophagy . 
 it is therefore essential to consider the cellular context in order to understand how the different er stress signals are integrated to yield a protective or cytotoxic autophagic response . 
 from the above discussion  it is clear that er stress and autophagy can activate both prosurvival mechanisms as well as lethal programs  especially under conditions of enduring er stress and organellar damage . 
 thus activation of the upr and autophagy may either impede or facilitate drug - mediated cell killing  and it is plausible that this will depend on the type of cancer and cytotoxic agents used . 
 while a growing number of reports have started to identify molecular elements of the cross - talk between er stress and autophagy ( see section 3.2 )  thus unraveling potential druggable targets  knowledge of the functional outcome of the activation of these pathways in cancer cells responding to chemotherapeutics is still very limited . in terms of therapeutic outcome 
  drugs ( or a combination thereof ) capable of activating the proapoptotic branch of the upr while simultaneously inhibiting its prosurvival function should provide the highest therapeutic benefit . 
 moreover  if autophagy activated following er stress is a survival response restoring er homeostasis ( e.g.  by the removal of protein aggregates )  its pharmacological blockage could protract upr activation until a critical threshold is reached  which may precipitate its proapoptotic function . on the other hand 
  autophagy may endorse the proapoptotic functions of certain er stress pathways ( see also section 4.1 ) or become a lethal backup pathway in cancer cells with defect on apoptotic signaling [ 133  148 ] . 
 a wide array of conventional and experimental chemotherapeutic agents has been shown to stimulate er stress and activation of upr along with autophagy in cancer cells . 
 for example  tunicamycin  thapsigargin  and brefeldin a activate autophagy in colon and prostate cancer cells thus mitigating er stress and protecting against cell death . 
 however  autophagy induced by the same chemicals does not confer protection in a normal human colon cell line and in the nontransformed murine embryonic fibroblasts but rather contributes to cell death . 
 the combined administration of vorinostat ( a histone deacetylase inhibitor ) and sorafenib ( a tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) to carcinoma cells promotes cell death although activates at the same time a protective er stress - driven autophagic response . 
 similarly  the resistance to imatinib mesylate ( a bcr / abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia ) might also rely  at least in part  on the secondary activation of er stress - induced autophagy . 
 by contrast  cannabinoid treatment activates er stress and autophagy leading to apoptotic cell death of glioma and pancreatic cancer cells but not of nontransformed embryonic fribroblasts or primary astrocytes ( in which neither er stress nor autophagy is activated in response to the treatment with these compounds ) . 
 likewise  other agents such as nelfinavir ( an hiv protease inhibitor with anticancer activity ) [ 151  152 ] or melanoma differentiation associated gene-7/interleukin 24 ( mda-7/il-24 ) [ 145  153 ] activate an er stress response that promotes autophagy and apoptosis of cancer cells . 
 increased expression of tetraspanins ( a family of proteins that facilitate the spatial organisation and localisation of multiprotein complexes in distinct membranal microdomains ) has also been shown to activate er stress and autophagic cell death . understanding the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the extent of autophagy activation in response to different triggering signals as well as the ones that control the interplay of this cellular process with apoptosis is therefore crucial to design new antitumoral therapies based on the modulation of the er stress - autophagy response . here 
 we discuss further a selected group of clinically used or promising cytotoxic drugs with a demonstrated ability of inducing both upr and autophagy  as paradigms to discuss the potential of targeting these pathways in cancer therapy . 
 cannabinoids  the active components of marijuana  of which thc is the most important owing to its high abundance and potency  exert a wide variety of biological effects by mimicking endogenous substances  the endocannabinoids  that bind to and activate specific cannabinoid receptors . 
 thus  treatment with these agents has been shown to curb tumor growth in various animal models of cancer [ 157159 ] . 
 the antitumoral action of cannabinoids is based on the ability of these agents to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and activate apoptosis of cancer cells [ 157  158 ] . 
 our recent findings have unravelled that cannabinoids induce autophagy in different types of tumor cells  including glioma / astrocytoma and pancreatic cancer cells  whereas they do not activate this cellular process in nontransformed cells ( which are resistant to the cell death - promoting activity of cannabinoids ) . of interest  pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy prevented cannabinoid - induced cell death as well as apoptosis  
 whereas abrogation of apoptosis prevented cell death but not autophagy as induced by these agents . 
 these observations led us to conclude that induction of autophagy is part of the mechanism by which cannabinoids promote the apoptotic death of cancer cells . 
 the in vivo relevance of these findings was demonstrated by the observation that cannabinoid treatment reduced tumor growth and activated autophagy and apoptosis in subcutaneous tumor xenografts derived from human u87 mg astrocytoma cells and transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( mefs ) . 
 likewise  similar results have been obtained in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer  in which we had previously shown a proapoptotic and an antitumoral action of cannabinoids ( [ 122  123 ]  salazar  m. and velasco g.  unpublished observations ) . 
 furthermore  autophagy - deficient tumors ( generated by subcutaneous injection of transformed atg5 mefs ) were resistant to thc antitumoral action  strongly supporting that autophagy is essential for the antineoplastic activity of cannabinoids . 
 in addition  analysis of samples obtained from two glioblastoma multiforme patients indicated that thc administration might also trigger autophagy - mediated cell death in human tumors . 
 as discussed in the previous section  the mechanism responsible for the activation of autophagy upon thc administration relies on a cannabinoid receptors - induced early accumulation of de novo - synthesized ceramide [ an event that takes place in the er ]  which leads in turn to er dilation and increased eif2 phosphorylation . 
 activation of this er stress response induces the up - regulation of several genes  including the stress - regulated protein p8 and its downstream targets atf-4 and chop and the pseudokinase trb3  which are required for the stimulation of autophagy in response to cannabinoid action . 
 trb3 plays a crucial role in the induction of autophagy upon thc administration through its inhibitory interaction with akt  which leads in turn to mtorc1 inhibition . in agreement with these observations  
 treatment of mice with thc decreased mtorc1 activity  stimulated autophagy and apoptosis  and reduced tumor growth in xenografts generated with p8 cells but not in those generated with p8 cells ( in which trb3 is not up - regulated in response to thc )  further confirming that the p8/trb3 pathway plays an essential role in the activation of autophagy and cell death by cannabinoids also in vivo . 
 cannabinoids activate therefore a cell death - promoting signalling route that involves the stimulation of er stress  autophagy  and apoptosis in cancer cells . 
 thus  cannabinoids constitute an interesting tool to investigate the differential molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the stimulation of autophagy - mediated cell death . on the other hand  the selectivity of cannabinoids ( which only stimulate the above - described cell death promoting pathway in cancer cells ) together with a low toxicity and good safety profile makes of these agents promising antineoplastic tools . 
 photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) is an anticancer therapy involving the selective photosensitization of malignant cell types  usually involving porphyrins  porphyrin analogs or other agents with suitable photophysical properties . 
 the initial step in the photodynamic process involves localization of the photosensitizing agent at subcellular loci  followed by irradiation with visible light of the appropriate wavelength [ 161  162 ] . 
 this results in formation of singlet oxygen and other ros that can cause photodamage at sites where the photosensitizing agent has localized . 
 since singlet oxygen will not migrate more than a fraction of a micron from the site of formation  as a result  photodamage can be quite specific . 
 thus  a distinguished property of pdt is that ros formation is mainly targeted to a particular subcellular site and affects a rather specific subset of molecular targets . 
 pdt with various agents has been shown to induce apoptosis along with autophagy and  in most cases  autophagy is activated as a mean to protect cells from killing . 
 agents found to be clinically useful were reported to show affinity for the er  mitochondria  lysosomes  or combinations of these sites . 
 a well - studied paradigm of er - localizing dye is hypericin  a naturally occurring phototoxin with promising applications in bladder cancer . 
 consistent with its predominant reticular localization in cultured cells  light activation of hypericin is coupled with massive er expansion  preceding ultrastructural features of apoptosis  both in vitro and in bladder cancer bearing rats ( verfaillie  t. and agostinis  p. unpublished observations )  and stimulation of upr . 
 upr activation is likely the result of immediate ros - damage to the serca pump  depleting er - ca store  which is followed by the concomitant activation of autophagy and mitochondrial apoptosis . 
 this ros paradigm of er stress is linked to a persistent activation of the perk - eif2-chop axis  with proapoptotic function ( verfaillie  t. and agostinis  p. unpublished observations ) . 
 induction of autophagy in er stressed cells unable to mount an apoptotic response ( because of bax / bak deficiency ) results in increased photokilling  suggesting the activation of an 
 conversely  in apoptosis - competent cells  blocking autophagy stimulation following er stress by sirnas that target essential modulators of the autophagic machinery  sensitizes to cell death  thus revealing a cytoprotective role for this pathway ( dewaele  m. and agostinis  p. unpublished results ) . 
 hence  it is tempting to speculate that autophagy inhibition may potentiate the proapoptotic perk pathway resulting in a better therapeutic opportunity  only when the cancer cell 's apoptotic machinery has not been fully disabled . 
 further studies are required to establish whether suppression of the autophagic pathway along with upr stimulation may represent a valuable therapeutic strategy in hypericin - based pdt . 
 targeting proteasomal degradation has proven to be a valuable approach in various cancer treatments  and proteasome inhibitors have emerged as a new class of er stress agents . moreover 
  recent evidence suggests that when used in combination with certain cytotoxic drugs  such as pdt  proteasomal inhibitors are capable of enhancing their anticancer efficacy  making these agents a very promising class of pharmacological agents in combinatorial therapy . 
 bortezomib ( ps-341 or velcade ) distinguishes itself from other proteasome inhibitors as it specifically inhibits the 26s proteasome by selectively blocking its chymotryptic activity . 
 velcade has been clinically approved for treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma [ 166  167 ] and has been shown to successfully induce apoptosis in various human cancer cell lines including myeloma  prostate  and breast cancers as well as squamous cell carcinoma [ 168170 ] . 
 moreover  preclinical studies indicate that bortezomib displays anticancer activity against pancreatic cancers  one of the most aggressive human diseases . 
 one of the potential mechanisms underlying the apoptotic effects of bortezomib in cancer cells relies on its ability to inhibit the nf-b pathway by blocking the degradation of its cytoplasmic inhibitor ib . 
 however  inhibition of nf-b alone could not fully account for the antitumor effect by bortezomib  suggesting additional pathways being involved . 
 since proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins retrotranslocated from the er to the cytosol represents the final step in erad  proteasomal inhibition causes an additional burden of unfolded proteins on the er . 
 this explains the high efficacy of bortezomib treatment against types of cancer cells in which the er is already predisposed with a considerable load . 
 for instance  hypoxic cancer cells that otherwise show increased resistance to genotoxic agents as well as myeloma cells producing high amounts of immunoglobulins are hypersensitive to treatment with proteasome inhibitors [ 174  175 ] . 
 therefore  therapies that target the er response in combination with bortezomib ought to be more successful . 
 indeed  it was shown that bortezomib sensitized pancreatic cancer cells to er stress mediated apoptosis . 
 additionally  we recently found a significant retardation of tumor growth in vivo in two different murine tumor models when photofrin - based pdt  a pdt approach stimulating the upr  was combined with bortezomib  or other clinically used proteasome inhibitors . 
 this suggests that blocking the proteasome might offer a new therapeutic avenue to potentiate the antitumor effect of pdt . 
 interestingly  schewe and aguirre - ghiso   found that myeloma cells surviving bortezomib treatment attenuated eif2 phosphorylation and induction of chop . 
 combined treatment with the gadd34-pp1 complex inhibitor salubrinal restored eif2 phosphorylation and chop induction  maximizing bortezomib induced apoptosis  thus suggesting that strategies capable of sustaining chop expression might be required to successfully eradicate tumors . 
 furthermore  these processes are functionally coupled and proteasomal inhibition has been shown to stimulate autophagy  likely as a compensatory mechanism . surprisingly  whether autophagy enhances apoptosis induced by proteasomal inhibitors or not seems to depend on whether the treated cells are transformed or not . 
 these findings suggest that a combined inhibition of both cellular degradation systems would enhance the antitumoral efficacy . 
 indeed  autophagy was shown to be activated in mcf-7 cells treated with bortezomib  by a mechanism which involved proteasomal stabilization of atf4 and atf4 dependent upregulation of lc3b . 
 this mechanism was suggested to contribute to the resistance of breast cancer cells towards bortezomib . 
 however  a recent study wherein myeloma cells where treated with bortezomib in combination with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyl adenine ( 3-ma ) resulted in an antagonistic response instead of the expected synergizing effect . 
 research during the last decade has contributed to highlight the important role of er stress and autophagy in the maintenance of the cellular homeostasis . 
 the last few years have also evidenced that both processes are closely related as some of the signalling routes activated during the er stress response are involved in stimulating autophagy . intriguingly  
 for example  accumulation of unfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases may activate a protective autophagy response . 
 by contrast induction of er stress in cancer cells may promote the stimulation of autophagy - mediated cell death or the activation of a protective autophagy that may contribute to the resistance to certain antitumoral therapies . 
 thus  different factors such as the intensity of the er stress signal  the simultaneous activation of additional pathways  the cell type  and so forth  must be integrated to yield a specific autophagic response . 
 considering that escape from drug - mediated cell killing is one of the major obstacles of current cancer therapy  a better understanding of the role played by these processes in cancer cells in response to chemotherapy would help us to devise new and more efficient therapeutic opportunities utilizing inhibitors or activators of these er stress pathways .","

1) Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a crucial role in proper protein folding, and perturbations caused by physiological and pathological conditions can lead to ER stress. This activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can promote cell survival or cell death.

2) Research and Discussion: The UPR is responsible for reestablishing ER homeostasis through adaptive mechanisms, such as autophagy. However, persistent ER stress can lead to the activation of pro-death functions and the inhibition of pro-survival mechanisms. This has important implications for anticancer therapies, which have been found to induce ER stress in cancer cells.

3) Results and Conclusion: As our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind UPR and autophagy activation by chemotherapeutic agents improves, we can develop strategies to improve their efficacy. By targeting specific functions of the UPR, we may be able to enhance the tumoricidal action of anticancer therapies and identify new targets for cancer treatment. This could lead to improved outcomes for cancer patients and open up new avenues for research."
"bevacizumab became standard of care as first - line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer ( mcrc ) in association with chemotherapy  but not all patients benefit from bevacizumab treatment . 
 cumulative data  gathered from retrospective studies  show that bevacizumab - induced hypertension ( htn ) appears to be associated with a statistically significant improvement in response rates  progression - free survival ( pfs ) and overall survival ( os ) . 
 bevacizumab - related htn may serve as a predictor biomarker of response / survival in patients with mcrc treated with bevacizumb in first - line setting . 
 in our subset of patients  htn g2 - 3 demonstrated to be predictive of response to treatment with bevacizumab and of pfs . a trend towards a favourable os was observed . 
 these results strengthen previous evidence that bevacizumab - related htn may be a potential predictive biomarker for bevacizumab efficacy . 
 in the context of an exponential increase in economic treatment costs  contributed by targeted therapy  the identification of a reliable  non - invasive  feasible and not costly predictive factor that would allow the selection of patients / tumours more likely to benefit from treatment and spare those who would not from additional toxicity is of great value in clinical practice . 
 colorectal cancer ( crc ) incidence and mortality rates vary markedly around the world . globally  crc is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females.1 approximately 25% of patients present with initial stage iv disease and almost half of the patients with crc will develop metastases with a crc - related 5-year survival rate approaching 60%.2 within the past 10  years  an increase in the number of chemotherapeutic agents available to treat this disease has been seen . 
 novel biologically targeted therapies  which interfere with specific molecular pathways of cancer proliferation and metastasis  are being developed.3 vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) is a key mediator of angiogenesis and plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of a wide range of human cancers  being a potential target for new anticancer therapies . 
 bevacizumab  a humanised anti - vegf monoclonal antibody  became standard of care as first - line treatment of mcrc  after showing effectivity in the treatment of mcrc with improvement in response rates and survival outcomes.46 although not all patients benefit from bevacizumab  selection of those who do profit from this therapy is still difficult because no biomarker has yet been identified that allows us to predict the benefit of the association of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in mcrc . 
 different biomarkers  such as b - raf and k - ras mutation  microvessel density  vegf receptor ( vegfr ) expression  have been widely studied  but none has proven to be a reliable predictive factor.7 
 8 hypertension ( htn ) is a common complication of the treatment with bevacizumab which is easily manageable with antihypertensive agents . 
 the pathogenesis of vegf signal inhibition - induced htn is still unclear with reports suggesting that impaired angiogenesis or endothelial dysfunction associated with bevacizumab treatment may be responsible.5 
 9 in fact  vegf signal antagonism may lead to inhibition of nitric synthase with a consequent decrease in the nitric oxide level  which in turn leads to vasoconstriction and decrease in sodium renal excretion  ultimately resulting in htn.9 cumulative data from recent studies have suggested that htn may be a biomarker for efficacy of vegf signal inhibition  namely of bevacizumab  due to the underlying mechanism of action . 
 retrospective studies have shown that patients who develop bevacizumab - induced htn showed increased response rates and progression - free survival ( pfs ) in comparison with those who did not . 
 these findings build up the hypothesis that bevacizumab - induced htn may represent a predictive and prognostic biomarker in patients with advanced colorectal cancer receiving first - line bevacizumab.5 
 10 
 11 the aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate if htn grades 2 to 3 were correlated with response to treatment with bevacizumab in first line  as well as with improved pfs and overall survival ( os )  in a series of patients with mcrc . 
 eligible patients were 18  years of age or older with histologically proven mcrc  with measurable disease  receiving bevacizumab as first - line therapy at a dose of 5  mg / kg every 2  weeks in association with irinotecan  5-fluorouracil and folinic acid  according to the folfiri regimen  or oxaliplatin  5-fluorouracil and folinic acid  according to the folfox regimen . 
 tumour response evaluation was performed with the use of ct or mri  depending on which imaging methods were used at baseline .

 grade 23 arterial htn was the cut - off level for htn definition in accordance with previous reports  indicating this level to be biologically and clinically relevant.3 
 9 patients were then stratified into two groups  those who did not present htn ( grade 01 ) and those who presented bevacizumab - related htn ( grade 23 ) . 
 tumour response and progression were assessed by radiologists of the home institution according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors  v.1.1 every 8  weeks .

 the median age at diagnosis was similar between the two groups ( about 60  years ) with a predominance of the male gender being observed in both arms ( 68.2% vs 65.8% ) . 
 all patients were evaluated in terms of ps presenting an ecog ps 0 - 1 . 
 the majority of patients ( 85.4% ) in the group who developed bevacizumab - related htn had an ecog ps 1  while in the group who did not  almost 66% presented an ecog ps of 0 . 
 the majority of patients had their primary tumour in the colon ( about 63% in both groups ) . 
 hepatic or lung metastases were more frequently seen in both arms with a similar number of patients presenting both liver and lung metastases . 
 peritoneal lymph node  bone  ovarian and/or penile metastases were observed  although to a lesser extent . in the group of patients who developed bevacizumab - related htn  
 more patients seem to have been previously submitted to surgery of the primary ( 56.1% vs 36.8% colon ; 19.5% vs 10.5% rectum ) . 
 a similar proportion of patients received chemotherapy for stage ii and iii crc in both groups . 
 the chemotherapy regimen most often used in association with bevacizumab in first - line treatment for mcrc was  undoubtedly  folfiri with more than 90% of the patients in both arms having received this treatment . 
 the majority of patients in both arms were evaluated for kras status  with 14 in the group that developed bevacizumab - related htn  and 15 in the group that did not  presenting a kras mutation . 
 nras status was evaluated in a minority of patients with all of those patients having an nras wild type . 
 about 40% of patients  in both groups  presented a previous diagnosis of htn managed with medical treatment . 
 forty - one patients ( 51.9% ) developed htn g2-g3 during chemotherapy - bevacizumab treatment ( 35 patients ( 85.4% ) grade 2 and 6 patients ( 14.6% ) grade 3 ) . 
 thirty - eight patients ( 92.7% )  after beginning treatment with adequate antihypertensive therapy  maintained bevacizumab until progression ( 3 suspended : 2 developed thrombotic events and 1 fistula ) . 
 all patients were evaluated in terms of response : 5 patients ( 6.3% ) presented complete response ( cr )  32 patients ( 40.5% ) partial response ( pr ) and 28 patients ( 35.4% ) stable disease . in the group of patients who developed bevacizumab - related htn  30 ( 73.2% ) presented response to treatment ( complete response ( cr)+partial response ( pr ) ) and 40 of them ( 97.6% ) achieved dc ( cr  pr or stable disease ) compared to 7 patients ( 18.4% ) with response and 24 ( 63.2% ) with dc in the group of those who did not develop htn ( or 12.08 ; 95% ci 4.13 to 35.29 ; p<0.001 responders vs non responders ; or 20.8 ; 95% ci 2.56 to 168.91 ; p 0.005 controlled vs non - controlled disease ) ( figures 1 and 2 ) . 
 htn g2 - 3 was an independent predictor of progression - free survival for all adjusted factors but not of os ( see online supplementary data ) . 
 number of patients with response in the groups of grade 23 bevacizumab - induced htn and without bevacizumab - related htn . 
 number of patients with disease control in the groups of grade 23 bevacizumab - induced htn and without bevacizumab - related htn . 
 a significant statistical difference was obtained in pfs between the two groups ( p<0.001 ) ( figure 3 ) . 
 the median os was 28  months ( 22.733.3 ) . in the group that developed bevacizumab - related htn  
 the median os was 33  months ( 25.740.3 ) and in the group that did not  it was 21  months ( 16.525.5 )  with no significant statistical difference between the 2 groups ( p 0.114 ) ( figure 4 ) . 
 pfs of patients with colorectal cancer with grade 23 bevacizumab - induced htn and without bevacizumab - related htn ( p<0.001 ) . 
 os of patients with colorectal cancer with grade 23 bevacizumab - induced htn and without bevacizumab - related htn ( p 0.114 ) . 
 target therapies like bevacizumab affect tumour growth by targeting specifically tumour - activated biological pathways . 
 new toxicity profiles with this new agents have emerged  as the acneiform skin rash with the anti - egfr therapy and vascular abnormalities associated with anti - vegfr agents.12 htn is a common adverse event of the treatment with antiangiogenic therapy ( such as bevacizumab ) that has been correlated with the biological inhibition of the vegf - related pathway and may represent a possible clinical marker for treatment efficacy  analogously to what has been demonstrated for skin rash and cetuximab.3 
 13 cumulative data  gathered from retrospective studies  show that bevacizumab - induced htn appears to be associated with a statistically significant improvement in response rates  pfs and os  raising the hypothesis that bevacizumab - related htn may serve as a predictor biomarker of response and survival in patients with mcrc treated with bevacizumb in a first - line setting . 
 scartozzi et al12 conducted a retrospective study which included 39 patients with mcrc treated with bevacizumab as part of front - line therapy . 
 twenty per cent of the patients developed grades 23 htn with a significant improvement in response rate ( 73.2% vs 18.4% p<0.001 ) and pfs ( 14.5  months vs 3.1  months p<0.001 ) being observed in the group of patients who developed bevacizumab - related htn with no statistically significant difference in the median os . in the sterlund et al14 study  56% of the patients presented htn with results showing that htn predicted bevacizumab treatment efficacy regardless of the analysed end point ( os  pfs or rr ) . 
 early htn  defined as htn within 3  months of treatment initiation  was shown to be predictive for os in this study . 
 similar data in metastatic renal cell carcinoma  breast cancer and lung cancer have also been published.1517 dahlberg et al16 showed that htn within 1  month in bevacizumab therapy for lung cancer was predictive for survival . 
 in our study  51.9% patients developed htn g2-g3 during chemotherapy - bevacizumab treatment  which is superior to that reported in other retrospective trials.6 
 12 
 16 according to a recently published large meta - analysis  the incidence of htn in bevacizumab - treated patients with cancer was 23.6%.18 a possible explanation may be that our study population presents a high predominance of the male gender being more frequently affected by primary htn  suggesting that bevacizumab - related htn may present the same biological pathway  or that this increase may be possibly due to selection bias since it is a retrospective trial . 
 our results seem to be in line with published data  with patients who developed bevacizumab - related htn showing an improvement in clinical outcomes  namely response rates ( 73.2% vs 18.4% p<0.001 responders vs non responders )  disease control ( 97.6% vs 63.2% p 0.005 controlled disease vs non - controlled ) and pfs ( p<0.001 ) . in our group  
 no statistical difference in the median os was observed ( 33  months vs 21  months p 0.114 )  although a trend towards a favourable outcome was seen in those patients with bevacizumab - induced htn . 
 htn g2 - 3 was an independent predictor of progression - free survival for all adjusted factors ( age  ecog ps and kras status ) but not of os . 
 this apparently conflicting result might be explained by the fact that htn is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease being associated with an increase in cardiovascular mortality and so possibly counteracting  in the long term  the potential beneficial impact on os . 
 the fact that more patients were submitted to surgery of the primary tumour in the group of patients who developed bevacizumab - related htn may reflect a population with less advanced disease at diagnosis . 
 only a minority of the patients were evaluated for nras status  which is explained by the fact that this mutation analysis only became available for clinical use in our institution recently . 
 the fact that it is a retrospective analysis  as the majority of the previous studies on this subject  presents some limitations as the lack of randomisation ( presenting possible selection bias ) and accuracy of data ( as it is carried out in a retrospective fashion ) . 
 the small sample size may also be a limitation  although this sample is larger than that of some of the previous ones reported ( scartozzi or sterlund ) . it would be interesting to perform analysis about the potential effect of antihypertensive medication on treatment efficacy in bevacizumab - treated mcrc . 
 owing to the sample size  the authors did not have adequate statistical power to evaluate this hypothesis . 
 it is known that inflammation might affect blood pressure ; however  owing to the fact that the c reactive protein level at baseline was not systematically evaluated for all patients  since it is normally requested in an infectious setting  this effect could not be assessed . 
 the accumulating evidence seems to imply that the identification of a reliable clinical factor such as bevacizumab - induced grades 23 arterial htn may constitute an early indicator efficacy  whereas lack of this side effect could represent a warning of lack of activity and maybe justify an early change in the treatment strategy  for example  egfr inhibitors.9 
 10 in the context of an exponential increase in economic treatment costs  contributed by targeted therapy  the identification of a reliable  non - invasive  feasible and not costly predictive factor that would allow the selection of patients / tumours more likely to benefit from treatment and spare those who would not from additional toxicity is urgent.3 
 19 in conclusion  in this subset of patients  htn g2 - 3 demonstrated to be predictive of response to treatment with bevacizumab and of pfs . 
 bevacizumab treatment - related htn is a very interesting subject at the moment and prospective studies  to disclose whether bevacizumab - associated htn predicts outcome and the exact mechanism for the development of anti - vegf related htn  are needed .","

1) Abstract: This study retrospectively evaluated the correlation between hypertension grades 2 to 3 and response to bevacizumab treatment in first line metastatic colorectal cancer. The results showed that patients with bevacizumab-related hypertension had higher response rates and improved progression-free survival. 
2) Research and Discussion: The use of bevacizumab has become standard of care for metastatic colorectal cancer due to its proven efficacy. This study aimed to determine if hypertension grades 2 to 3 could serve as a potential biomarker for treatment response. The results suggest that bevacizumab-related hypertension may predict response and improvement in progression-free survival. 
3) Results and Conclusion: In this study, 51.9% of patients treated with bevacizumab developed hypertension. Of those, 73.2% showed a response to treatment and 97.6% achieved disease control. There was a significant difference in progression-free survival between patients with and without bevacizumab-related hypertension. Overall, these findings suggest that hypertension grades 2 to 3 may be a useful biomarker for predicting treatment response and improving outcomes in metastatic colorectal cancer patients receiving bevacizumab as first-line treatment."
"the need to advance saliva research is strongly recognized by the strategic plan of the national institute of dental and craniofacial research . 
 the ability to monitor health status  disease onset  progression  recurrence and treatment outcome through non - invasive means is highly important to advancing health care management . 
 saliva ( oral fluid ) is a perfect medium to be explored  offering the potential for a non - invasive  easy to obtain means for detecting and monitoring disease . 
 the adoption of saliva testing would allow a patient to collect their own specimens at home  yielding savings in health costs  convenience for the patient and facilitating multiple sampling . 
 specimen collection is less objectionable to patients than in the case of other bodily fluids and easier in children and older individuals . 
 the analysis of saliva can thus provide a cost - effective approach for the screening of large populations . due to these significant advantages  
 developing biomarkers in saliva for the detection of serious illnesses such as oral and systemic cancers has been on the national healthcare agenda for several years ( government performance & results act 2008 ) . 
 one mandate formulated in the government performance & results act report is that by the year 2013 proof of principle will be obtained for the ability of saliva to monitor health and diagnose for one systemic disease . 
 a vast amount of saliva omics data has been generated by recent studies using high throughput technologies . 
 however  there are still barriers which researchers must overcome before such data can be exploited  such as lack of computationally accessible salivary data and information  and inability to cross - reference the salivaomics data that could potentially be made available through different proteomics  transcriptomics  genomics and metabolomics studies . for these reasons 
  there is an urgent need to create the salivaomics knowledge base ( skb )  a data management system and web resource constructed to support saliva diagnostics research  and we present below the informatics advances brought about through the skb and through the associated tools and resources . 
 ontologies are controlled structured vocabularies designed to provide consensus - based means to ensure consistent description of data by scientists working in disparate domains . as applied in the biomedical domain 
  ontology plays a key role in providing consensus - based controlled vocabularies serving the consistent annotation of biological and medical data and information  most conspicuously within the framework of the gene ontology and now of its sister ontologies within the open biomedical ontologies foundry ( http://obofoundry.org ) . 
 the basic formal ontology ( bfo ) is a formal ontological framework developed by barry smith  pierre grenon and others  which serves as the starting point for some 100 ontology projects primarily in the biomedical domain ( http://www.ifomis.uni-saarland.de/bfo/ ) . 
 the bfo framework can be readily extended to the treatment of families of ontologies of other types  above all to the treatment of relations between ontologies of different levels of granularity  from genes to species and from a single patient to epidemics at a geographical scale ( combining applications of bfo to the medical and to the geographical domain ) . 
 the framework may also be used as a tool for dealing with the relations between distinct perspectives on the biomedical domain  including culturally generated perspectives of the sort which are studied by linguists and anthropologists . 
 two bfo - based ontologies of special significance for our work here are the ontology for biomedical investigations ( obi ) and the ontology for general medical sciences . 
 the obi is an ontology designed to serve the coordinated representation of designs  protocols  instrumentation  materials  processes  data and types of analysis in all areas of biological and biomedical investigation . 
 ontology for general medical science is an ontology of the entities involved in the clinical encounter . 
 thus  it includes very general terms that are used across medical disciplines  including :  disease '   disorder '   disease course '   diagnosis '   patient ' and  healthcare provider ' . 
 to advance the consistency of data in the dental research community  smith et al . 
 propose an approach to building a consensus - based ontology to support dental research ( odr ) . 
 in analogy to efforts in other fields  a consortium of research groups specializing in different areas of study would undertake such an effort  each building different components of ontology to support dental research . 
 initial efforts in this direction  by scientists in dental research and biomedical ontology at university at buffalo and university of california  include work on the ontology of oral pathology  oral maxillofacial anatomy  dental disease and dental procedures  and as we discuss below  the saliva ontology . 
 integral to his work is a plan to allow a seamless connection between the use of ontology to support dental research in the dental domain and the use of existing ontology resources developed in other areas of biology and medicine  by reusing elements and strategies from them . 
 the work on dental diseases is carried out in conjunction with the development of ontology for general medical science . 
 the saliva ontology ( salo ) ( figure 1 ) is a detailed ontology of this bodily fluid that is optimized to meet the needs of both the clinical diagnostic community and the cross - disciplinary community of omics researchers . 
 the salo is created through cross - disciplinary interaction with saliva experts  protein experts  diagnosticians and ontologists . to aid development and testing of salo 
  we develop a corpus of saliva - relevant literature in skb to assist in characterizing core terms and synonyms within the ontology and to provide links between salo content and relevant items in pubmed . 
 skb will also incorporate the results of experiments in data and text mining using the ontology . 
 salo will incorporate links to existing ontologies and terminology resources involving treatment of saliva - relevant phenomena . 
 we will also identify and represent within salo relationships to saliva - relevant types represented in ontologies such as the gene ontology  the protein ontology and the chemical entities of biological interest ontology  and also provide links to corresponding snomed ct terms where available . 
 each term in the ontology has its own url which points to a webpage providing definitions  pubmed sources  references to annotations to skb and to external databases . 
 it is cross - platform and supports many popular relational database managements systems  including mysql  oracle  postgresql  sql server and db2 . 
 the software is data - agnostic  and can therefore be easily adapted to existing data sets . 
 it is expandable and customizable through a plug - in system  and is open - source so the community can participate in deeper development . 
 furthermore  biomart can seamlessly connect geographically disparate databases  facilitating collaboration between different groups . 
 these features have catalyzed the creation of biomart central portal  a first of its kind community - supported effort to create a single access point integrating many different  independently administered biological databases . 
 anybody can contribute an independently maintained resource to the central portal  allowing it to be exposed to and shared with the research community  and linking it with the other resources in the portal . 
 users can take advantage of the common interface to quickly utilize different sources without learning a new system for each . 
 the system also simplifies cross - database searches that might otherwise require several complicated steps . 
 several integrated tools streamline common tasks  such as converting between i d formats and retrieving sequences . 
 the combination of a wide variety of databases  an easy - to - use interface  robust programmatic access and the array of tools make central portal a one - stop shop for biological data querying . 
 sdxmart is a biomart data portal that hosts salivary proteomic  transcriptomic  metabolomic and microrna data and offers access to the data by using the biomart interface and querying environment . 
 the sdxmart is designed to provide a variety of queries to facilitate saliva biomarker discovery including complex queries that integrate genomic  clinical and functional information . 
 the sdxmart holds data from projects of oral diseases and systemic diseases including oral cancer  sjgren 's syndrome  pancreatic cancer and breast cancer . 
 the types of datasets are : ( i ) proteomics ; ( ii ) transcriptomics ; ( iii ) microrna ; and ( iv ) metabolomics . 
 in addition  the sdxmart is imported with several public databases including ensembl genome database ( ensembl release 37 )  and the number of resources is continuously growing . 
 it is being built in tandem with the salo and sdxmart which will allow the skb to interoperate with other omics databases as part of a general strategy to facilitate integration of heterogeneous and disparate data sources that enable system biology approaches . 
 either salo or sdxmart is a first and only resource of its kind in the field of dentistry .","

The development of these tools is a major step towards advancing basic, translational, and clinical saliva research."
"emergence of new concepts in the management of oncologic malignancies and the fast - changing trends of modern medicine necessitate the development of strategies for customized treatment suited to the patient 's variable requirements . 
 response to chemotherapy can not be predicted with certainty in an individual presently . moreover  the histopathological changes after chemotherapy vary in patients . 
 studies have systematically described various histopathological changes seen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a variety of tumors including breast carcinoma  rectal carcinoma  ovarian carcinoma  head and neck carcinomas  esophageal carcinoma  wilms tumor  and non - small - cell lung carcinoma . however  the emphasis of these studies varied and no study described the pathologic changes following chemotherapy comprehensively . 
 this study describes the various histopathologic changes seen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast malignancies  squamous cell carcinomas  adenocarcinomas  and wilms tumor . 
 the present prospective study was carried out on 60 patients including 40 patients with carcinoma breast and 20 patients with other malignancies who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy . during a study period of one - and - a half years 
  a total of 355 patients were treated for breast carcinoma with neoadjuvant chemotherapy . of these 
  40 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria as per the protocol of the thesis project were included in the study . 
 inclusion criteria was patients with prechemotherapy clinicoimaging assessment of tumor size  with an established histological diagnosis of carcinoma on biopsy  and who had received at least two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy . 
 the study group was divided into three subgroups ; group a ( n = 30 ) and group b ( n = 10 ) included breast carcinoma patients with initial pathologic material submitted as trucut or wedge biopsy in group a and lumpectomy specimens in group b. group c ( n = 20 ) included cases of other malignancies besides breast carcinoma who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy . after initial tissue diagnosis  the patients were clinically examined in detail and investigated including radiological  imaging  and other laboratory tests to decide the stage of the cancer . 
 the initial biopsies were subjected to routine formalin fixation and paraffin processing with microscopic analysis on hematoxylin- and eosin - stained sections supplemented by special stains including immunohistochemistry to decide histological type and grade of the tumor according to the world helath organization ( who ) classification . 
 detailed histopathological examination was carried out especially looking for chemotherapy - induced histopathologic changes like necrosis  fibrosis  inflammatory reactions  and other retrogressive changes . for carcinoma breast  neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens either included cyclophosphamide 50 to 60 mg / m2 iv ( iv : intravenous )  doxorubicin 40 to 50 mg / m2 iv  and 5-fluorouracil 500 to 800 mg / m2 iv ( caf )  or cyclophosphamide  epirubicin  and 5-fluorouracil ( cef )  21 days apart . 
 number of chemotherapy cycles varied from two to six depending on the initial size of the tumor to make them operable . 
 the drugs and doses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy given to the patient were recorded in the pro forma . 
 the tumor cells were evaluated for dissociation  dyscohesion  and loss of organization of the tumor cells and necrobiotic changes such as necrosis  vacuolation of nucleus and cytoplasm  karyorrhexis  pyknosis  and karyolysis . any change in pattern or type of carcinoma was noted . 
 the stroma was examined for host response including fibrosis  elastosis  and collagenization  and infiltration by lymphocytes  plasma cells  fibroblasts  histiocytes  and giant cell formation was observed . 
 epithelial - to - stromal ratio was calculated as the mean of readings in all sections and viable - to - nonviable tumor cell ratios were calculated in both pretreatment biopsies and postchemotherapy specimens  viability being defined as distinct nuclear chromatin with intact nuclear and cytoplasmic membrane in the absence of the criteria of necrosis ( karyorrhexis  karyolysis  pyknosis ) . 
 a note was made on the tumor type and any change after chemotherapy ; tumor grading was done based on the elston and ellis modification of bloom - richardson ( mrb ) grading system and nottingham prognostic index ( npi ) was calculated . 
 lymphocytic response was graded as : grade 1  scattered lymphocytes between tumor cells ; grade 2  formation of microaggregates of lymphocytes ; grade 3  dense infiltration of lymphocytes destroying tumor cells or forming masses . 
 the presence of lymphovascular embolization and in situ disease / cancerization of ducts were separately noted . 
 twenty cases of other malignancies ( group c ) besides breast included 12 cases of squamous cell carcinoma ( seven from head and neck  four of cervix  and one of esophagus )  five cases of adenocarcinoma  and three of wilms tumor . 
 neoadjuvant chemotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck included chemotherapy based on docetaxel  cisplatin  and 5-fluorouracil ( tpf regimen ) . 
 patients with carcinoma cervix received paclitaxel and carboplatin regimen  and for esophageal carcinoma  cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil was given . 
 chemotherapy given for ovarian carcinoma was paclitaxel and carboplatin  and patients with anorectal carcinoma received a 5-fluorouracil- and oxaliplatin - based regimen ( folfox ) . 
 children with wilms tumor received vincristine and dactinomycin cycles varying from three to four cycles  as was considered appropriate for reducing the bulk of the tumor . 
 histologic sections from all the malignancies were observed for any change in differentiation  changes in architecture  necrobiotic changes  and host tissue response . 
 pearson 's coefficient of correlation was applied to correlate the three types of response patterns with all the parameters observed . 
 breast tumors which showed complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy included five of ductal carcinoma - not otherwise specified ( nos ) type  and one each of schirrhous  apocrine  and tubular types . 
 apocrine change and tubular and papillary pattern disappeared in postchemotherapy specimens ; mucinous change and metaplastic change appeared in two each of ductal nos types . 
 ductal nos with metaplastic change differentiated to completely metaplastic in mastectomy specimens [ table 1 ] . 
 carcinoma breast : histological types of the tumor before and after chemotherapy number of cases with metastasis was 22 ; number of lymph nodes with metastatic deposits was 88 . 
 the most common pathologic changes noted were necrosis  elastosis / collagenization  and lymphocytic response . there was no relation of lymphocytic response with the clinical or pathologic response irrespective of their presence in the pre or postchemotherapy specimens . 
 giant cell response was significantly correlated to all the types of response grades ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 collagenization was significantly correlated to pathologic and tumor regression grade ( p < 0.05 ) [ tables 2 and 3 ] . 
 carcinoma breast : inflammatory and stromal response seen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy carcinoma breast : inflammatory and stromal response seen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in axillary lymph nodes in the present study  of the total 20 cases of group c  12 cases were of squamous cell carcinoma ( seven from head and neck  four of cervix  and one of esophagus )  five cases were of adenocarcinoma  and three cases were of wilms tumor . 
 of the 12 cases of squamous cell carcinoma in the present study  there was improvement in histological differentiation from moderate to well - differentiated carcinoma in two cases of head and neck cancers  whereas there was complete pathologic disappearance of tumor in another two cases comprising one case each of carcinoma tongue and cervical carcinoma . 
 other histological changes observed were increase in keratinization with formation of keratin pearls  acellular keratin with islands of nonviable tumor cells  histiocytic giant cells  and increase in lymphocytes surrounding residual tumor cells . 
 of the five cases of adenocarcinoma  a change in histological differentiation was seen in a case of anorectal carcinoma which revealed poor differentiation with solid sheets  a small amount of mucin in the initial biopsy  and moderately differentiated mucin - secreting adenocarcinoma with large mucin pools after chemotherapy . in serous papillary adenocarcinoma of the ovary  
 degenerative changes were observed with karyorrhexis  pyknosis  smudging  dyscohesion  and loss of papillary architecture in some areas . in a single case of esophageal adenocarcinoma  an increase in signet ring cells 
 adenocarcinoma : histological differentiation before and after chemotherapy of the three wilms tumors  one was biphasic and two were triphasic . 
 in the two cases revealing triphasic wilms tumor in the pretreatment biopsy  blastemal component decreased with marked necrobiotic changes and totally disappeared in the one with biphasic wilms tumor . 
 mesenchymal component revealed rhabdoid differentiation in one and chondroid differentiation in the other with the presence of smooth and skeletal muscles . 
 in the present prospective study  a spectrum of histopathologic changes was observed with the use of chemotherapy . 
 the effects have been divided into two  as pathologic changes in tumor cells and changes in the stroma . in the tumor cells  nuclear enlargement  nuclear shrinkage  necrosis  
 vacuolation of nucleus  cytoplasm  pyknotic nuclei  and degenerative changes have been described in the literature.[159 ] in the present study  loss of architecture  dyscohesion  and shrinkage of tumor cells with retrogressive changes like karyorrhexis  karyolysis  and pyknosis were observed in addition to the above - mentioned changes . in view of the presence of a large variety of retrogressive changes  
 the emphasis was more on trying to recognize viable tumor cells  morphologically identified as cells with distinct nuclear chromatin with intact nuclear and cytoplasmic membrane in the absence of criteria of necrosis ( karyorrhexis  karyolysis  pyknosis ) . 
 necrosis was the most common event observed . in the stroma  fibrosis  elastosis  collagenization  hyalinization  microcalcification  and neovascularization have been observed and described.[56813 ] in the present study  in addition  some prominent findings were elastosis/ collagenization of the stroma  hyalinization of the walls of the blood vessels  and atrophy of the adjacent breast parenchyma and cancerization of ducts even in atrophic lobules . 
 collagenization was found to be significantly correlated to pathologic response and tumor regression grade ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 lymphocytic reaction and the presence of plasma cells and macrophages with the formation of histiocytic giant cells observed in many studies may be indicative of host tissue response to necrobiotic tumor.[5101214 ] the most common inflammatory host response observed in the present study was lymphocytic ; others included mixed inflammation  plasmacytic  prominent histiocytic  and giant cell types . 
 giant cell reaction was significantly correlated to all types of tumor responses ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 pathologically similar changes were observed in response to chemotherapy in draining lymph nodes but not as pronounced as in the primary site . 
 though these changes have been observed by many workers  positive correlation of the presence of these changes with the effect on chemotherapy has not been significant in many studies . according to them  
 the presence of fibrosis  elastosis  collagenization  hyalinization  necrosis  inflammatory infiltrate  lymphocytic response  giant cell reaction  plasma cells  foamy macrophages  microcalcification  and neovascularization were not significantly related to the response to chemotherapy . 
 honkoop et al . concluded that none of the pretreatment pathologic or biologic characteristics were predictive of a good pathologic response . in the present study  
 the most common type was ductal carcinoma nos ; mucinous change appeared in three patients after chemotherapy who were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma nos type in the initial biopsy  and a transformation from ductal to metaplastic carcinoma and from papillary pattern to ductal nos was seen in one case each . 
 a change to either a higher or lower grade was noted by rasbridge et al . 
 complete response was seen in one case of apocrine carcinoma and disappearance of apocrine component in mixed ductal with apocrine differentiation in another . 
 the response in the case of ductal carcinoma nos was not significantly different from the response in invasive lobular carcinoma . in the present study  
 the clinical and pathologic response was not found to have a significant correlation with the prechemotherapy grade . 
 however  significant correlation was observed between the postchemotherapy grade and the pathologic and tumor regression grades but not with clinical response . 
 so  a better response to chemotherapy was observed in the poorly differentiated malignancies with higher mrb and npi grades and a poorer response with well - differentiated ones ( p < 0.05 ) [ figure 1 ] . 
 in contrast  sanchez et al . observed a poor response in poorly differentiated carcinomas . 
 carcinoma breast : occasional nests of viable tumor cells left post chemotherapy ( h and e ; 100 ) post neoadjuvant chemotherapy  hyalinization of the blood vessel wall was a common finding . 
 the adjoining breast showed atrophy of parenchyma ; even then  terminal duct lobular units ( tdlus ) revealed ductal carcinoma in situ ( dcis)/ cancerization of ducts by surviving tumor cells in some cases . 
 no correlation of size with the response grades was observed  that is  size reduction after chemotherapy was seen in both small and large tumors and was not restricted to any one group . 
 in squamous cell carcinoma  changes observed were improvement in histologic differentiation in some  complete pathologic disappearance of the tumor in a few  an increase in keratinization with formation of keratin pearls  acellular keratin with islands of nonviable tumor cells  histiocytic giant cells  and increase in lymphocytes surrounding residual tumor cells in most cases [ figure 2 ] . 
 in adenocarcinoma  an improvement in histologic differentiation was seen with large mucin pools after chemotherapy  degenerative changes were observed in serous papillary adenocarcinoma of the ovary  and an increase in signet ring cells was noticed in an esophageal carcinoma [ figure 3 ] . in wilms tumor 
  there was an almost complete disappearance of blastemal component and retrogressive changes in the epithelial component . 
 squamous cell carcinoma : after chemotherapy  only necrotic masses of keratin with areas of calcification are left ( h and e ; 100 ) adenocarcinoma : abundant pools of mucin with occasional scattered tumor cells after chemotherapy ( h and e ; 40 ) wilms tumor : only few bizarre tumor cells persisting along with the mesenchymal component with complete disappearance of the blastemal component which was a triphasic tumor before chemotherapy ( h and e ; 200 ) the results of this study again reveal that the response to chemotherapy may be markedly variable in patients . the desired response in some 
 may be achieved with a fewer number of cycles  whereas in other patients  the tumor may resist even with the maximum number of neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles presently employed  thus defeating the very purpose even at the potential risk of toxicity . 
 it was also concluded that the tumor grade decreases and differentiation improves  in addition to the retrogressive changes and increase in stromal component as a result of chemotherapy in carcinoma breast as well as in other malignancies .","

1) Abstract: The present study aims to observe the histopathologic changes seen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast malignancies, squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas and Wilms tumor, using breast cancer predominantly as the model. Results showed significant decreases in tumor grade and improvements in differentiation. 

2) Research and Discussion: Stromal reactions, including fibrosis and neovascularization, were observed in addition to tumor cell changes such as nuclear enlargement, necrosis, and vacuolation. Inflammatory response also varied, with lymphocytic being the most common. A detailed literature review was also conducted. 

3) Results and Conclusion: Findings suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy leads to retrogressive tumor changes, increase in stromal component, and improvement in differentiation in breast cancer and other malignancies. Giant cell reaction was significantly correlated to all types of tumor responses. Overall, chemotherapy appears to have a positive impact on tumor histopathology."
"acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) is a clinically  morphologically and genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by clonal expansion of myeloid blasts in peripheral bone marrow ( bm )  blood or other tissues . 
 the incidence of aml increases with age  particularly after 65 years old  and the median age at diagnosis is around 70 years . 
 age in itself is one of the most powerful prognostic factors for survival in aml   . 
 elderly patients not only present more comorbidities and worse performance status   but also have more adverse molecular features compared to younger patients   . due to the presence of comorbidities and poor performance status  intensive chemotherapy ( ic ) or 
 allogeneic stem cell transplant is often unsuitable for a large proportion of elderly patients with aml  resulting in early mortality and prolonged hospitalization  . 
 however  when feasible  treatment is associated with better survival when compared to best supportive care only but the median overall survival achieved with ic in the elderly is only 513 months  . 
 therefore  there is an increasing need for new treatment options for elderly patients with aml . 
 the aza-001 phase iii trial has demonstrated effectiveness of azacitidine ( aza ) in a dose of 75  mg / m2 daily for 7 consecutive days in patients with high - risk myelodysplastic syndromes . a subset analysis of the aza-001 trial restricted to patients with 2030% bm blasts  demonstrated superior efficacy of aza when compared with conventional care regimens  leading to aza international approval for the treatment of low bm blast count ( 2030% ) who - defined aml . 
 these results raise the question of the potential use of aza in aml irrespectively of the bm blast count . 
 this is supported by the identification of somatic mutations of genes involved in epigenetic regulation in approximately 30% of aml patients . 
 consequently several groups have assessed and reported the efficacy of aza in patients with aml    . more recently a randomized phase iii trial comparing first - line aza to conventional therapies  including intensive chemotherapy  in elderly patients with aml revealed that aza achieved clinically meaningful survival benefit compared to conventional treatments . 
 we present herein a multi - centre retrospective analysis of 77 aml patients who were treated with aza in first line or due to relapsed / refractory disease . 
 the main aim was the characterization of the efficacy and safety of aza treatment in aml patients in portugal . 
 we also conducted an exploratory comparison of overall survival between patients receiving 1st line treatment with aza and elderly aml patients treated with ic alone . 
 patients with aml who received at least 1 cycle of aza were selected for inclusion . 
 the comparator group comprised 50 matched patients from a historical cohort of aml patients from a single institute . 
 patient data was collected retrospectively from patient files from 4 portuguese institutions following written informed consent . 
 the study was approved by the ethical committee of instituto portugus de oncologia de lisboa  francisco gentil  epe and all data treated according to the declaration of helsinki . 
 overall survival ( os ) was defined as time from start of treatment with aza ( either 1st or 2nd line ) or ict ( 1st line ) to death from any cause or last follow - up . 
 progression - free survival ( pfs ) was defined as time from start of treatment until disease relapse / progression or death from any cause . 
 survival curves of the different treatment groups were compared using the log - rank test ( univariate analysis ) . 
 all tests were two - tailed and p - values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant . 
 seventy - seven patients treated with aza and 50 elderly aml patients treated with ict were included .

 their frailty imposes limitations upon the aggressiveness of the treatment which can be administered  . 
 in addition  the poor prognostic disease features often seen in this population mean that refractoriness and relapse are more frequent . treatments for this population require an optimal balance of tolerability and efficacy . 
 the main aim in most cases is to prolong survival and reduce the impact of cytopenias without undue toxicity . 
 aza has demonstrated efficacy in high risk mds  reducing transfusion requirements and prolonging survival . in this 
 setting it had proven to be well tolerated including by those more elderly . based on this experience  several groups have tested the efficacy and safety of aza in elderly patients with aml with promising results    . 
 our results are in line with previous reports that aza is efficacious in the treatment of aml regardless of the blast count . 
 the response rates and the overall survival observed in our study are in consonance to those reported by other groups    . 
 it is noteworthy that the rates of cr obtained with aza are equivalent to those obtained in some published series of elderly patients treated with ic . 
 improved survival in our cohort was significantly associated with any quality of response  including maintenance of stable disease . 
 this suggests that aza is capable of delaying progression  and thus prolong survival  even if no hematological or marrow improvement are obtained . 
 this supports its use in this population until frank progression is detected or until the patient receives another more definitive treatment  such as allogeneic bone marrow transplant . 
 another significant finding of our analysis is the efficacy of aza in those who are refractory or relapsed following ic . 
 the fact that survival from start of aza is similar in first and second line patients indicates that relapsed / refractory patients benefit equally . 
 the comparison of the cohort treated with aza first line with the comparator group treated only with ic highlights the advantages brought by the former treatment modality . 
 it is important to note that this finding has not been confirmed in a randomized trial . 
 however  41% of the trial patients were treated with aza following failure with ict whereas our comparator group never received aza . 
 as aza has demonstrated efficacy as second line therapy  this could explain the difference in our findings . 
 the significantly lower survival of the ic cohort indicates that this population benefits from less intensive treatment options which target other pathophysiological processes . the retrospective nature and the limited numbers of patients in 
 the collaborative nature of the study helps reduce bias which may be introduced by single centre data 
 . however our study adds new evidence to the use of aza in elderly patients with aml and indicates that it is at least not inferior to conventional ic . 
 the response rates and survival data here presented support its use in first line in those who are not candidates for ic and in second line in those who are refractory or relapsed following ic . 
 this and future collaborative studies will add to trial data to better identify those patients who benefit most from new treatment modalities  thus improving the management of elderly patients with aml .","

Abstract:
This study analyzed retrospective data from 77 elderly AML patients treated with azacitidine (aza) and 50 treated with intensive chemotherapy (ic) from Portuguese hospitals. The median OS for patients receiving aza as first-line treatment was 10.6 months, with an overall response rate of 44%. The results showed a significant impact of aza on OS compared to ic and support its efficacy in any line of treatment for elderly AML patients.

Research and Discussion:
The study found that aza had a significantly higher median OS compared to ic in elderly AML patients. This supports the use of aza as first-line treatment for AML in this population. The overall response rate of 44% also suggests that aza is an effective treatment for AML in the elderly. These findings highlight the need for further research and exploration of aza as a treatment option for AML in the elderly.

Results and Conclusion:
The overall results of this study support the efficacy of aza in the treatment of AML in elderly patients, regardless of the treatment line. Aza was found to have a significantly higher impact on OS compared to ic. These findings have important clinical implications and suggest aza as a potential alternative to intensive chemotherapy for elderly AML patients. Further research is needed to confirm these results and better understand the potential benefits of aza in this population."
"one of the most important organ systems is cardiovascular that it 's disorders specially ischemic heart diseases can cause disability or death . 
 some people specially workers who work in special industries are more in the risk of same disorders . 
 there were many studies work on workers health but there were some of them  study on cardiovascular system because these disorders have more than one etiology and one of the modifiable risk factors or etiology is work exposure . according to these realities ; cardiovascular disorders risk factors were assessed and measured such as triglyceride  total cholesterol  low density lipoprotein ( ldl )  high density lipoprotein ( hdl )  blood pressure  obesity  smoking  genetic . also shift work  stress  carboxi hemoglobin ( cohb )  solvents  noise  vibration  temperature of environment  air pollution 
 can find the high risk personnel with non occupational and occupational risk factors of cardiovascular disorders . 
 exposure to fumes  solvents  additives and drugs  carbon monoxide  carbon disulfide  pesticides  heavy metals  cold or warm environment  air pollution  vibration and noise can cause occupational cardiovascular disorders 
 had demonstrated work as a farmer  have a heavy and manual work  exposure to noise and some physical or chemical were cardiovascular disorders risk factors . 
 ghiasvand et al . in their study had shown that work in rail road industry was a risk factor and can cause hyper low density lipoprotein  specially in workers who had shift work . in study of national heart  lung  and blood institute had been shown that the work in tunnel can cause exposure to carbon monoxide and other study on foundry workers can cause the same exposure . 
 kim et al . in other study had demonstrated that work in refrigerated industry was not a risk factor but workers who work in cold place and environment had diastolic blood pressure in more amount  it was in comparison between exposure to cold and non exposure to it . 
 had shown that work as a engine driver had cardiovascular risk factors  because they had more hypertension and hyperlipidemia than control group . 
 kang et al . in their study had found that work in companies and related job mental stress specially in the background of decision making it was related to amount of cholesterol and triglyceride  in the background of demands of work these were related to systolic blood pressure . 
 chin - ming lin et al . had demonstrated that medical technicians had more hypertensive disorders than other healthcare workers . 
 also kim had shown the relationship between cold exposure and increasing of blood pressure or hypertension . 
 the objective of this study was comparison of cardiovascular risk factors between workers in different industries of iran .

 this study has been approved by university board  for research ethics ; with oral satisfaction and i told that cumulative data have been used result will be without name of industries . 
 results are in three sections  general information  specific information and cardiovascular risk factors from 875 workers of industries . 
 403 ( 46.0% ) from automobile industry  166 ( 19% ) from food industry and 304 ( 35% ) from light works had been participated in this study . 
 in general mean of age  work duration  body mass index  smoking had been calculated . 
 the mean of age in automobile industry was 34.87  6.19 years old  in food industry was 34.13  8.64 years old and in light works was 31.40  5.70 years old with f = 25.146 and p < 0.001 . 
 the mean of work duration in automobile industry was 10.37  4.86 years  in food industry was 5.94  2.46 years and in light works was 5.16  1.98 years with f = 117.286 and p < 0.001 . 
 76 ( 18.8% ) of automobile industry workers were smoker  none of the food industry worker and 11 ( 3.6% ) of light works were smoker . in specific information mean of systolic blood pressure  diastolic blood pressure  triglyceride  total cholesterol  low density lipoprotein ( ldl )  high density lipoprotein ( hdl )  fasting blood sugar had been measured . in table 1 
 these information had been demonstrated and there were comparison of related variables to cardiovascular disorders between industries workers . 
 comparison of risk factors to cardiovascular disorders between industries workers then number and percent of cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity  hypertension  hyper triglyceridemia  hyper cholestrolemia  hyper low density lipoprotein  lower high density lipoprotein  diabetes mellitus  were determined and compared in table 2 . although the person - time in automobile industry  food industry and light works were 4179.11  986.04 and 1568.64 . 
 according to the results workers of food industry more healthy than other industries for cardiovascular disorders  mean of high density lipoprotein ( hdl ) was more than 63 mg / dl and it was preventive factor . also according to results automobile industry workers had more obesity  hypertension  hyper triglyceridemia  hyper low density lipoprotein  lower the high density lipoprotein  diabetes mellitus . after the regression analysis  hypertension  hyper triglyceridemia  lower high density lipoprotein had significant difference and more in automobile industries . 
 there were some same results in previous studies  but total cholesterol  systolic and diastolic blood pressure were more in food industry workers but in the normal range . 
 sancini et al . had demonstrated that exposure to noise and some physical or chemical were cardiovascular disorders risk factors . 
 had demonstrated that work as a engine driver had cardiovascular risk factors  because they had more hypertension and hyperlipidemia than control group . 
 ghiasvand et al . in their study had shown that work in railroad industry was a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and can cause hyper low density lipoprotein and total cholesterol in blood  specially in workers who had shift work . 
 cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension can cause stroke  heart diseases   and had relation to long time disability and out of work . forbidden the smoking  control of temperature were popular advices for managers of industries to have healthy workers . 
 there were fumes  solvents  stress  heavy metals   in automobile industry that affect the cardiovascular system  although were controlled . 
 in study of national heart  lung  and blood institute had been shown that the work in tunnel can cause exposure to carbon monoxide and other study on foundry workers can cause the same exposure . 
 but about food industry temperature of environment is more important risk factor  that was controlled in food industries of iran . 
 the workers in automobile industries had more work duration  older and body mass index . 
 also light works such as office worker  administrative  healthcare  sanitary workers had more risk factors than food industry workers  that may be had better health with follow up of screening results . 
 screening of cardiovascular disorders risk factors in all works and industries can helpful and benefit . according to other studies in some industries controls of shift work  stress  noise  
 vibration and chemical exposures are helpful . in this study  after multi nominal logistic regression ; hypertension  hyper triglyceridemia  lower the high density lipoprotein were significant and the most in workers of automobile industry . 
 automobile industry have a lot of cardiovascular risk factors  these were fumes and other chemicals  physicals  control of them can reduce the risk of occupational cardiovascular disorders  one of the ways to control was engineering method  then administrative and at the end personal protective devices . medical surveillance with periodic examination for 
 screening of non occupational and occupational disorders  specially risk factors of cardiovascular disorders can be helpful . 
 screening of cardiovascular disorders risk factors were important and helpful in industries specially automobile industry  that might be preventive method for these disorders in the future .","

Abstract:
This study compares the risk factors for cardiovascular disorders among workers in three different industries in Iran. The objective is to emphasize the importance of screening for these risk factors, which can lead to disability or death.

Research and Discussion:
Data was collected from 875 workers and analyzed using SPSS. It was found that all the risk factors were within normal range, except for low HDL levels in automobile workers. There was also a significant difference in the prevalence of hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia within this industry.

Results and Conclusion:
Screening for cardiovascular risk factors is crucial, especially in high-risk occupations such as the automobile industry. These findings can help in implementing preventive measures to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disorders among workers."
"vesicoureteral reflux ( vur ) occurs commonly in children  resulting in potentially serious complications . 
 this could result in renal scarring  hypertension  and even end - stage renal failure . 
 treatment options for children with vur include continuous antibiotic prophylaxis  endoscopic injections  and laparoscopic or open ureteroneocystostomy . since hutch   introduced open ureteral reimplantation to correct vur in 1952  many such techniques have been developed . in 1984  
 endoscopic injections of tissueaugmenting material for the correction of vur were introduced ; since then  many urologists prefer this procedure . 
 endoscopic injection is frequently used now as a firstline treatment because it involves less pain and a shorter hospitalization period and leaves no scar  in contrast to open reimplantation . 
 however  when an injection treatment fails  open ureteral reimplantation should be considered for treating persistent vur . 
 we aimed to test the usefulness of open reimplantations  which were performed primarily and after failed endoscopic injection procedures . 
 we analyzed the records of 81 children who underwent open reimplantation surgery over about 10 years . among them  64 underwent open reimplantation as a primary procedure ( group a )  and 17 underwent it after failed endoscopic injection ( group b ) . 
 we retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of both groups  including age  sex  preoperative reflux grade  operation time  laterality of surgery  postoperative complications  and hospitalization period . 
 all patients were classed in terms of preoperative reflux grade using voiding cystourethrography ( vcug ) . 
 reflux grade was classed as grades i - v according to the international classification system of the international reflux study committee . 
 we classified patients with reflux grades i - iii as a low - grade reflux group  and patients with grades iv and v as a high - grade reflux group . 
 success of surgery was defined as resolution of the vur as determined by vcug 6 months after surgery . 
 in addition  we conducted a telephone - based survey of the parents of group b about their preference for endoscopic injection or open reimplantation  and the reasons for their preference ; we asked the parents "" which surgery do you choose primarily between endoscopic injection again and ureteral reimplantation if your child have to undergo surgery for vesicoureteral reflux again ? and what is the reason ? "" . 
 statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics ver . 20.0 ( ibm co.  armonk 
 student t - tests and chi - square tests were applied to compare the parameters of each group ; p - values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant . 
 the mean ages of groups a and b were 49.637.1 months and 56.522.5 months  respectively . 
 the male - to - female ratios of groups a and b were 43:21 and 12:5  respectively . 
 there were no statistically significant differences in age or sex distribution between the 2 groups ( p=0.236 and p=0.312  respectively ) . 
 the low - grade reflux rates in groups a and b were 12 ( 18.8%  grade ii were 2 [ 3.2% ] and grade iii were 10 [ 15.6% ] ) and 8 ( 47.1%  grade ii were 3 [ 17.7% ] and grade iii were 5 [ 29.4% ] )  respectively  and the high - grade reflux rates were 52 ( 81.2%  grade iv were 34 [ 53.1% ] and grade v were 18 [ 28.1% ] ) and 9 ( 52.9%  grade iv were 7 [ 41.3% ] and grade v were 2 [ 22.2% ] )  respectively . 
 patients with high - grade reflux were significantly more common in group a than b ( p=0.022 ) . at 6 months after endoscopic surgery in group b  
 the numbers of patients with low- and high - grade reflux were 10 ( 58.8%  grade ii were 5 [ 29.4% ] and grade iii were 5 [ 29.4% ] ) and seven ( 41.2%  grade iv were 6 [ 35.3% ] and grade v were 1 [ 5.9% ] )  respectively . 
 there was no significant change in the numbers before and after primary endoscopic surgery in group b ( p=0.738 ) . 
 however  group a still had more patients with high - grade reflux after endoscopic surgery than did group b ( p=0.020 ) . 
 the operation times for unilateral cases in groups a and b were 16736 minutes and 15518 minutes  respectively . 
 those for bilateral cases in groups a and b were 21533 minutes and 21623 minutes  respectively . 
 the mean hospitalization periods for groups a and b were 10.45 days and 8.82 days  respectively . 
 there were no serious postoperative complications except that bleeding occurred in both groups . in groups 
 a and b  7 ( 11.0% ) and 2 patients ( 11.9% )  respectively  needed postoperative blood transfusions because of anemia . 
 however  this difference was not statistically significant ( p=0.107 ) . at 6 months after surgery  
 resolution of vur was found in all patients who underwent vcug . in the survey of the parents of children in group b  
 eleven parents ( 64.7% ) answered that they would choose endoscopic injection first in the same situation . 
 the reasons included the convenience of endoscopic treatment  that there was no need for hospitalization  that it involved less pain than open surgery  and that it avoided the discomfort from urethral catheterization after open surgery . 
 the main reason was that they did not want their children to have multiple procedures and anesthesia . among the eleven parents who chose primary endoscopic surgery  7 of their children had low - grade reflux  and 4 had high - grade reflux . among the 6 parents who chose primary open surgery  one of them had a child with low - grade reflux  and 5 had a child with high - grade reflux . 
 parents of children with low - grade reflux preferred endoscopic surgery ; however  there was no statistically significant difference ( p=0.064 ) ( table 2 ) . 
 selecting the treatment option for different grades of vur reflux depends on the clinical presentation and renal function . 
 however  minimally invasive treatments such as endoscopic injection have advantages over open surgery  including less postoperative pain and fewer bladder spasms and infections  and the absence of surgical scarring . 
 furthermore  this procedure can be performed in a short operation time  in an outpatient setting  and with minimal use of postoperative analgesics . 
 therefore  endoscopic treatments have been preferred as the first - line treatment for children with vur . in a meta - analysis  elder et al 
 .   showed that after one injection the reflux resolution rate was 78.5% for grades i and ii reflux  73% for grade iii  63% for grade iv  and 51% for grade v . 
 the american urological association ( aua ) vesicoureteral reflux guideline update committee analyzed data from 17972 patients  and reported that the overall success rate of a single endoscopic treatment was 83.0% . as seen above  endoscopic treatment of children with vur had many advantages and a high success rate  but there were also many failures  especially in the children with more severe reflux . when the first endoscopic treatment fails  endoscopic treatment needs to be repeated or reimplantation surgery is indicated . in this study  we analyzed the characteristics of our patients who underwent open reimplantation surgery . 
 patients who underwent reimplantation as a primary treatment did not differ from those who underwent it after endoscopic injection in terms of age  sex  operation time  hospitalization period  or postoperative complications . 
 it is generally assumed that a secondary operation after failed a primary procedure is more difficult and has more complications . in open reimplantation for vur 
 after failed endoscopic surgery  we also supposed that it may show less success rate  more operation time  more complications  and more hospitalization periods because of ureteral adhesion or inflammation due to primary injection or because each patient had more severe vur . 
 however  as in our findings  several studies have reported that previous endoscopic treatment does not have an adverse effect on the success of subsequent open reimplantation . in many studies  
 open reimplantation for vur showed much higher success rates than endoscopic treatment for all grades of reflux . in the aua guidelines  the success rate for open surgical procedures was 98.1% . 
 chertin et al .   reported the success rate of open reimplantation following failed deflux injections to be 100% . a similar study by moreira - pinto et al 
 sencan et al .   showed that previous endoscopic injections could cause difficulties in dissection of the ureter because of fibrosis ; however  they did not alter the success rate or complications following open surgery . 
 parental preference has a major role in the selection of endoscopic treatment compared with long - term antibiotic treatment . in a survey  
 80% of parents preferred endoscopic treatment rather than antibiotic prophylaxis or open surgery when given the option of any of the three treatment modalities . 
 this is due to the failed cases of endoscopic injection is very small  because of high success rate of endoscopic injection . 
 these patients were received endoscopic injection again or ureteral reimplantation to treat vur after failed endoscopic injection according to patients conditions and parents demand . 
 therefore  the number of patients underwent ureteral reimplantation was very little  and this study was not analyzed by patient matched - anlaysis . 
 in addition  the follow - up duration after surgery was not long  and several patients did not undergo a follow - up vcug . 
 accordingly  further studies with more patients and a longer follow - up duration are needed . 
 however  it is meaningful that this study showed open reimplantation can be applied effectively for failed endoscopic surgery . 
 in addition  even a parent whose child experienced failed endoscopic injection prefer endoscopic injection as primary treatment for vur . 
 patients with high - grade vur tended to have open ureteral reimplantation as their primary surgery rather than endoscopic injections . 
 however  there were no significant differences in operation time  postoperative complications  hospitalization period  or surgical success rates between open ureteral reimplantation surgery after failed endoscopic injection for vur and primary open reimplantation . 
 we conclude that open reimplantation can be conducted safely and effectively after failed endoscopic treatment . 
 in addition  parents prefer endoscopic injection as the first - line treatment option for their children with vur because of its convenience and reduced postoperative discomfort .","

Abstract:
This study compares the efficacy of secondary ureteral reimplantation (UR) after failed endoscopic treatment for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) to primary UR. Telephone surveys were conducted on parental satisfaction of endoscopic treatment and surgery.

Research and Discussion:
Charts of eighty-one children enrolled in the study were reviewed. Mean age, operative time, and postoperative complications show no significant difference between groups. Telephone survey results revealed parents still preferred endoscopic treatment despite possible secondary UR.

Results and Conclusion:
The study found no significant difference between secondary UR after failed endoscopic treatment and primary UR. Parents still preferred endoscopic treatment as the first line of treatment for VUR, despite the potential need for secondary UR."
"in all well developed societies there tend to be barriers between different organizations and different professions  even when those professions want to co - operate to help individuals to satisfy their needs .

 how can we increase our understanding of health and social services that are located in different organizations ? 
 lindberg   observed examples of meaningful co - operation at the local level  with colleagues from different organizations meeting and pooling their knowledge of local conditions with the patient or user as the focal point . 
 the phenomenon has been variously called the chain of care  integrated care  seamless care or shared care . 
 this co - operation aims at creating a continuing relationship with the patient / user regardless of who at a given moment is the responsible provider . 
 edgren and stenberg   found these practical attributes of co - operation in cass : 
 a common task is shared among the co - working agents.collaboration is in people s minds  it is instinctive behaviour.each actor s capabilities are known and respected.a combination of monetary and non - monetary incentives exists in order to create lasting mutually acceptable solutions . 
 collaboration is in people s minds  it is instinctive behaviour . each actor s capabilities are known and respected . 
 a combination of monetary and non - monetary incentives exists in order to create lasting mutually acceptable solutions . according to brommels in his presentation to the ehma - conference 2006 
  the cas approach means  among other things : 
 identifying and supporting constructive relations between agents within the system  and understanding tensions and conflicts.avoiding strict definitions of roles and concentrating on agreed actions.giving agents their freedom to organize current activities . 
  identifying and supporting constructive relations between agents within the system  and understanding tensions and conflicts . avoiding strict definitions of roles and concentrating on agreed actions . giving agents their freedom to organize current activities . 
 if we are to improve our understanding of how a health or social service provider functions as an integrated part of a locally driven health and social service system  we need an innovative  in terms of changing practice  model to guide our thinking . traditional models view systems as machines . 
 it helps us understand what happens in dynamic living systems  where many agents are interconnected . in order to make clear its significance let us first recapitulate the machine model . for a long time effective organizations 
 the machine has a constructor  the top manager  who describes the integral parts and how they are supposed to co - operate . 
 hospitals and other health services organizations are usually designed to function according to principles of scientific management [ 15  16 ] . 
 rationality  objectivity  stability and predictability are the terms we associate with this approach . 
 rationality  for example  requires that all integral parts act on perfect information  have the same background and similar values and work towards the same goals  and that there is a system designer  the top manager  who is from outside the system . 
 change is seen as a linier and predictable process  controlled by top managers and carried out by works managers . 
 plans are made and are to be followed  and the intended change  takes place as a direct consequence . if problems do arise during the implementation of change  then either there is wrong expectations or there is an inability or refusal to take prescribed action . 
 the change takes time and energy and the outcome is difficult to take in . when political decisions setting precise goals are centralized and detailed rules are laid down and lines of action specified  and when there is constant top - down monitoring and assessment  there is a very real risk of destroying capacity and motivation at the so - called 
 and then  when the unforeseen happens  the whole system breaks down  because there is no readiness or capability to adapt  all  solutions have been pre - programmed beforehand . from this 
 we learn that when there is no motivation to renew the system  when there is an inability to innovate  the survival of the system is threatened . 
 if health and social service providers are to meet changing demands and expectations from patients or users  they must be able to move quickly to find mutually acceptable  locally developed forms of integration at their points of intersection  that is  where their separate services should be coming together . instead of theories assuming cause and effect linkages between separate details  we need theories to deal with patterns and principles . 
 a few years ago concepts such as the knowledge society and learning organizations  and the associated mechanisms and technologies  the internet  e - mail  mobile phones and digital imaging  were all unknown . 
 davis   coined the expression  any time  any place  when he describes how time and space restrictions 
 this has given us enormous possibilities to communicate  to become connected  to network . 
 as we advance in the  knowledge society   the basic assumptions behind much of what is taught and practiced in the name of management are now hopelessly out of date . indeed  most of our assumptions about organizations are at least fifty years old . 
 so why turn to complexity science and to complex adaptive systems ( cas ) ? according to zimmerman et al . 
 they provide an alternative to traditional management principles  that is they offer patterns and principles whereby we can better act in an increasingly complex world  as when we attempt to harness health and social care and other services to meet the particular needs of the individual . in such a way complexity science can serve as a sense making tool . 
 it also enables us to develop locally adapted solutions in order to manage complex tasks  such as we find in advanced home health care . 
 complexity can be expressed as the amount of information needed to describe or understand something . and 
 the term  complex  emphasizes that the necessary competence to perform a task is not owned by any one part  but comes as a result of co - operation within the system . 
 a cas consists of several subsystems called agents  which act in dependence of one another . 
 . they may either compete or co - operate according to their sense of their interests and what will bring them an advantage . 
 self - organization is about creating order or increasing the regularity of the system without help from the outside . 
 good examples would be the ant - hill  the human immune defence  the financial market and the surgical operating theatre team . 
 important work has been carried out at the new england complex system institute and the santa fe institute and elsewhere . 
 researchers in chemistry  physics  biology  medicine  anthropology economics  and sociology have been asking fundamental questions about living systems  living systems that are not fixed  but change  grow  heal up  adjust  renew and develop organically . 
 prominent figures in the field include nobel laureates ilya prigogine in chemistry [ 26  27 ] and murray gell - mann in theoretical physics . within medicine 
 we find stuart kauffman [ 30  31 ] and physics russ marion and mary uhl - bien . 
 according to augustinsson  one way to explain the phenomenon of complexity is by reference to the possibility to apply routines to carry out a particular task . 
 the more a task is characterized by regularities the more we can think in terms of applying routines . 
 when everyday work is characterized by both regularities and irregularities  by a mix of the predictable and the unpredictable  then we have the highest degree of complexity . 
 although more research is needed to achieve greater understanding of complex adaptive systems and to strengthen the knowledge base for action  we do have a growing number of examples that show the cas concept gaining ground within the health and social services . 
 the agents see the point  because they create order out of many local interactions . 
 complexity science offers new ways to understand how complementary knowledge organizes for co - operation . 
 we can regard integrated care partners as partners in a common system and we can regard them logically as agents in this system . 
 emergency treatment is a clear example of independent agents interacting locally with other independent agents . 
 another example comes from elderly care where the cas concept has been applied to secure agreement between politicians and civil servants . 
 the objective was to identify how local politicians and managers understand problems and goals regarding the structures and processes involved in the care of the elderly . a common vision  easy to understand and to communicate  
 there is no external constructor  no superior centrally located source to govern the design of the system . 
 when we study a cas  the focus is on the interaction and communication between agents . rewriting the old clich  that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts  the whole is the relations between the parts . whether between two persons or between human being and machine or between machine and machine  it is the intensity of relations that determines the complexity of the system  the constant change  adaptation and development of the system  which will be in an unforeseeable non - linear way . today 
 digital imaging as a diagnostic technology brings together the specialist radiologist and the primary practitioner treating the patient in a way that was virtually impossible previously . and 
 thereby generate new possibilities of professional interaction and patient involvement as well as new forms of inter - organizational collaboration . 
 complexity science emphasizes the inherent power of development and self - organizing nature of the system . 
 attempts from above to reduce the complexity of the system in order to gain control  are often counterproductive . 
 in practice we assume that any provider s top down attempt at specifying tasks will risk more complexity for the patient . 
 such top down attempts are usually made in order to make it simpler for the provider  not the person seeking care . 
 when we address a given community s health and social problems  the process is local : both in intelligence gathering  using multiple local sources to build up the knowledge base for action  and in connecting all those locally based agencies / institutions and individuals with competence to do something about them . 
 one important aspect of complexity science is that it has shown how complementary knowledge organizes for co - operation . 
 later studies of cass have emphasized how the interplay between the environment and the system results in a sort of co - development  whereby each influences the other . 
 so  for example  a hospital inpatient can at the same time be a part both of the hospital system and another system at his workplace . 
 positive feedback loops enhance or amplify changes and tend to move a system away from equilibrium stage . 
 for example in general terms  there is a positive feedback loop between income and consumption in an economy . the bigger the income of the individuals  
 negative feedbacks tend to dampen or buffer changes and hold a system to some equilibrium state  like a thermostat in a fridge . these loops are carriers of information  material and energy between the agents of the system  and facilitate the adaptability of the entire system . in complexity science positive and negative feedback 
 there is not much sense in agents spending time separately on detailed planning since the functioning of the system is a result of their interactions . instead holden   talks about  direction without directives 
 . it has been found that for purposes of fostering connectivity among diverse agents  effective coupling of structures  ideas and innovations  and ensuring that they are neither too loose nor too tightly interdependent  complex systems are better led by indirect than by direct leadership behaviours . 
 the cas approach helps agents to see themselves as co - workers  part of an innovative team with great potential . with their local knowledge of needs  
 they are so much better placed to act than any centrally located management ever could be . 
 they sense that they have control over their own work situation  perhaps the most important change needed to create  the good workplace  . in this way 
 we see that the cas approach satisfies the fundamental human need to participate  to have a feeling of solidarity  to be part of a greater whole . 
 general criticisms of the cas approach coming from practitioners concern a lack of recommendations as to how they should behave being part of a cas . 
 others may argue that this is only one of several possible approaches to promote integrated care . 
 communication- and co - ordination conflicts among participating agents  or rather free riding agents  have been noted . 
 a certain level of system inertia may also develop over time . to learn to use a different approach to organizing may mean insecurity and risk similar to being expected to accept new technology . 
 seen from a staff perspective the cas approach may mean increased insecurity  greater responsibility  more decision - making and more elements of risk management . 
 the cas approach raises some ethical concerns that refer to decision making that can neither be supported by science nor by objective criteria . 
 first this is due to the nature of the system which is determined by the sum of choices made in it . 
 secondly  when there appears to be no simple final objective or calculable ground for our decisions  we can not shift the responsibility for the decision onto something or somebody else   do nt blame me ; the genetic algorithm said we should sell !  we know that all our choices to some extent represent a step in the dark  and therefore  we can not but be responsible for them . 
 but the cas approach lays out the considerations to be taken into account more clearly than the alternatives . 
 for a long time effective organizations have been looked upon like well - oiled machines . 
 the machine has a constructor  the top manager  who describes the integral parts and how they are supposed to co - operate . 
 hospitals and other health services organizations are usually designed to function according to principles of scientific management [ 15  16 ] . 
 rationality  objectivity  stability and predictability are the terms we associate with this approach .

 seen from a staff perspective the cas approach may mean increased insecurity  greater responsibility  more decision - making and more elements of risk management . 
 the cas approach raises some ethical concerns that refer to decision making that can neither be supported by science nor by objective criteria . 
 first this is due to the nature of the system which is determined by the sum of choices made in it . 
 secondly  when there appears to be no simple final objective or calculable ground for our decisions  we can not shift the responsibility for the decision onto something or somebody else   do nt blame me ; the genetic algorithm said we should sell !  we know that all our choices to some extent represent a step in the dark  and therefore  we can not but be responsible for them . 
 but the cas approach lays out the considerations to be taken into account more clearly than the alternatives . 
 when the competence necessary for carrying out a given task does not lie within one individual provider organization  co - operation between agents within the system comes into play to discharge that task . 
 we are no longer talking about the individual organization / agent but shaping overall workable solutions taking a patient / user perspective . 
 this applies to matching care with the needs of different patient groups and of individual patients . 
 the cas approach helps the management to understand why the traditional top down way of managing may meet with problems in organizations with complex tasks . 
 an important discussion is about how the top management in fact executes its steering function . 
 leaders may consider accepting complexity instead of trying to reduce it  formulate few simple and concrete goals  communicate and give feedback and measure performance . 
 when we perceive health and social service organizations as cass we should gain more insight into the processes that go on within and between organizations . 
 are we willing to face the interdependence between health and social services  the dependence on collaboration to deliver appropriate integrated care ? 
 if we do  complexity science could be an important step towards fresh thinking in order to fulfil our patients and users presently unfulfilled needs .

1) Abstract: Organizations as Systems in Understanding Integrated Care
2) Research and Discussion: Complex Adaptive Systems Theory for Organizational Management 
3) Results and Conclusion: Implementing CAS Approach for Improved Integrated Care Management"
"we will introduce recent advances on the study of post - translational processing  modification  and targeting of cathepsins and cystatins . 
 almost all the intracellular proteins are passed through principally similar processes from the synthesis to their degradation in general . 
 therefore  i would like to introduce the general fate of intracellular proteins  from the post - translational processing  modification  and targeting to the ordered particles . 
 as figure 1 shows  the intracellular proteins are synthesized as pre - promature complex in polysomes and prepart is removed cotranslationally  and then the promature parts are translocated into golgi - apparatus  and then glycosylated by mannose - rich sugar . 
 the glycosylated mature part is translocated into target organelles and the degradation was started by the splitting from the ordered nicked bonds to make hydrophobic peptides . 
 these hydrophobic peptides are secreted to cytoplasm and are incorporated into the phagosomes or proteosomes after ubiquitination . 
 biological merit of post - translational processing   and modifications of proteins are possible considerations . 
 the capability to take variable forms on the way of biosynthesis is important to keep adaptability to the changing of biological requirements and intracellular translocation during the maturation must be regulated . 
 pro - parts or bound sugar are the targeting signals in some cases . in the cases of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase ( cps ) and ornithine transcarbamylase ( otc )  their pro - 
 parts play the role of signals to be recognized by their receptors located on target organella membrane  such as lysosomes  as shown in figure 4 . 
 the glycosylated cathepsins are targeted into lysosomes mediated by mannose-6 phosphate receptors which are located on the lysosomal . 
 as figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) show  the lysosomes in which cathepsin h or b is located are attached to the cell - membrane . on the contrary  
 cathepsin l is located in the lysosomes which are distributed diffusely in liver cells . as figure 4(a ) shows  using immunodouble gold - particle staining  cathepsin b ( small gold particle ) and cathepsin h ( large gold particle ) are located clearly in different lysosomes . 
 cathepsin l is translated as 17 amino acids of prepart  96 amino acids of pro - part and 221 amino acids of mature - part [ 9  10 ] . 
 the prepart is removed cotranslationally and formed procathepsin is translocated into golgi - apparatus  and then the 108-asn and the 155-asn in mature parts are glycosylated by high - mannose - type sugar  as shown in figure 2(a ) . the initiation of the degradation is started from the nicking bond ( 178 bond ) cleavage by some cysteine protease . 
 cathepsin b   is translated as 17 amino acids of prepart  62 amino acids of pro - part  and 252 amino acids of mature part [ 12  13 ] . 
 the prepart is also removed cotranslationally and the formed procathepsins are translocated into golgi - apparatus and then the 38th - asn in pro part and the 111th - asn in the mature - part are glycosylated by high - mannose - type sugar . then the mannose-6-phosphate - moities play a role as the targeting marker to the lysosomes . 
 cathepsin h is translated as 21 amino acids of prepart  114 amino acids of pro - part  and 217 amino acids of mature part . 
 the pro - part has two carbohydrate chains at the 70th - asn and the 90th - asn and the mature part consisted of 217 amino acids  and one carbohydrate chain is bound at the 99th - asn [ 8  15 ] . the initiation of degradation is started from the 177th nicking bond by cysteine protease . 
 intracellular protein degradation (=  autophagosome formation ) is regulated by nutritional and hormonal conditions . 
 fasting or insulin enrichment caused stimulation of the phagosome formation and cathepsin l amount are increased ; on the contrary  refeeding and glucagon enrichment resulted in the suppression of phagosome formation and decreasing of cathepsin l amount . 
 as you see in figure 2  cathepsins b  l  and h have individual ordered nicking bond as the initiation of their degradations ; these bonds are cleaved by cysteine protease  therefore as table 1 shows  the half - lives ( t1/2 ) of cathepsins and the contents in lysosomes clearly increased by treatment by e-64 ( inhibitor for all cysteine proteases ) . 
 the initiations of degradation of cathepsins are started from the ordered limited proteolysis by cysteine protease in the lysosomes  as figure 2 shows . 
 the formed hydrophobic products were translocated into autophagosome or proteasome ( after ubiquitinated ) to degrade to amino acids . 
 procathepsins or mature cathepsins are secreted from the various cells and play individual physiological  or pathological roles . as figure 5 shows  
 bone metabolism is consisted of functional balances between osteoblastic cell function and osteoclastic cell function . 
 bone collagen is degraded mainly by cathepsin l and k  therefore they are called collagenolytic cathepsins . 
 the secretion of these cathepsins from osteoclasts is stimulated by pht ( parathyroid hormone ) and suppressed by vitamin d3  e-64  ca-148 eta . 
 therefore  bone metastasis of cancers is inhibited by cathepsin inhibitors  such as by e-64 or clik-148 . 
 as pit formation test in table 4 shows  bone - matrix degradation is catalyzed by cathepsin l  but not by cathepsin b. 
 endogenous low - molecular weight cathepsin inhibitors are consisted of two big groups  one is only located in skin and the other is ubiquitously located in all organs . 
 cystatin  ( a )   is only located in epidermis  cystatin  ( b )   is located ubiquitously in all cells ( organs ) . 
 the secretary formed cystatins are cystatin c in eggwhite and cystatin s in the saliva . 
 another secretary group having high - molecular weight ( repeated low molecular cystatins ) is kininogen family in serum . 
 each cystatin shows different inhibitory specificity for individual cathepsins  for example  cystatin  does not inhibit cathepsin b activity but strongly inhibit cathepsin l activity and cathepsin h activities [ 7  19 ] . 
 the amino - acid sequences of low - molecular weight cystatin family have strong homology  however  their post - translational processing are quite different . because their localizations and biological functions is quite different . when skin was stained by immunohistochemistry using anticystatin  antibody  only the cornified - envelope of skin was stained . 
 the sphingosine treatment to new born skin resulted in the strong suppression of the targeting of cystatin  into the cornified envelope . 
 the sphingosine is a powerful inhibitor for protein kinase c. as shown in figures 7(a ) and 7(b )  threonine residue in near c - terminus ( the 92th threonine in figure 9 shows ) of cystatin  is phosphorylated by protein kinase c  and the phosphorglated cystatin  is incorporated into cornified envelope . 
 the participation of protein kinase c in the phosphorylation of cystatin  was also confirmed using specific inhibitor of protein kinase c  ( hidaka h-7 ) inhibited the incorporation of p into cystatin . the phosphorylated cystatin  was incorporated into skin cornified envelop . in the envelop  
 the phosphorylated cystatin  was conjugated with filaggrin - linker sediment peptide which is rich in glutamine residues  mediated by epidermal transglutaminase in the presence of calcium  and yield a high - molecular weight protein ( skin fiber )  as shown in figure 10 . 
 the phosphorylated cystatin  showed strong inhibition to cathepsin l  but not to the cathepsin b and h  it also showed strong inhibition to the bacterial cysteine proteases and virus cathepsins . 
 therefore  cystatin  and phosphorylated cystatin   showed strong protection from infections of bacteria or viruses in skin . 
 post - translational covalent modification of cystatin   and the changing of their inhibitory activities . 
 the third position of the n - termius - cysteine residue of cystatin  reacts with glutathione to form a mixed disulfate complex and also is able to make dimmer by the disulfate bond . 
 as figure 8 shows  n - terminus of cystatins was inserted into the substrate binding pocket of cathepsins  the glutathionated or the dimmer form were unable to insert into the binding pocket of cathepsins . 
 the coefficient of oxidized or reduced forms of glutathiones regulates the inhibitory activity of cystatin . therefore  the activities of cathepsins are regulated by the intracellular redox potentials in spite of the changes of the inhibitory activities of cystatin .   as figure 7(b ) shows  using -cell of pancreas  the cystatin  is located in insulin secretion particles  therefore  cystatin  is secreted with insulin in the pancreas .",".


1) Abstract:
Cathepsins are essential proteases that play important roles in protein catabolism and synthesis. Their activity is regulated by post-translational modifications as they are translated as pre-pro-mature forms and undergo processing and modification to reach their target organelles for proper function.

2) Research and Discussion:
The pre-peptide of cathepsins is removed during translation and then translocated to the Golgi apparatus where the pro-part is removed and the mature-part is glycosylated. The mature-part is then targeted to the lysosome mediated by the mannose-6-phosphate signal and binds with coenzymes. The degradation of the mature-part begins with limited proteolysis and the resulting hydrophobic peptides are degraded either in the phagosome or proteasome.

3) Results and Conclusion:
Cystatins, endogenous inhibitors of cathepsins, play a crucial role in maintaining proper cathepsin activity. Phosphorylation of cystatin near the C-terminus by protein kinase-C leads to its incorporation into the cornified envelope and conjugation with filaggrin-fiber to form the linker-fiber in the skin. Modifications such as glutathione binding or dimer formation can render cystatins inactive, with their activities regulated by the redox potential of glutathione. These findings shed light on the intricate regulation of cathepsin activity and its crucial role in maintaining cellular processes."
"endocrine disorders may complicate  cause or mimic otolaryngologic disorders  some of which may be anatomical  due to an enlargement of the thyroid gland  while others are physiological  resulting from increased or decreased glandular activity.1 hypothyroidism is characterized by the slowing of mental and motor activity  depression  constipation  cold intolerance menorrhagia  stiff muscles  carpal tunnel syndrome  sleep apnea  dry hair and skin  weight gain  snoring and a hoarse voice.1 less common symptoms involve the heart  muscles  joints  and blood.2 dysarthria as the presenting symptom of hypothyroidism has only been reported once before.3 here  we present an unusual case of hypo - thyroidism presenting with dysarthria . 
 a 39-year - old female presented to the clinic with dysarthria of six months duration . 
  it was revealed that there had been episodes of dysphonea  snoring  sleep apnea  dysphagia and choking during eating or drinking . 
 her past medical history was normal apart from one occasion of delayed recovery from anaesthesia during surgery for a fractured femur the year before . 
 clinical examination  including the central nervous system  was normal apart from a slightly puffy face . 
 there was no abnormality in the movement of the tongue or pharygeal / palate muscles . 
 pmol / l ( normal 9.2 - 23.9 pmol / l )  a thyroid stimulating hormone of 82.7 miu / l ( normal 0.32 - 5.00 miu / l )  antithyroglobulin antibodies were 1:320 u / ml ( normal 1:40 u / ml )  antiperoxidase autoantibodies of 1:1600 u / ml ( normal 1:40 u / ml ) . 
 a complete blood count film was consistent with iron deficiency  a haemoglobin of 7grams ( normal 11 - 16 grams )  low serum iron of 2 umol / l ( normal 10 - 28 
 umol / l )  increased red cell distribution width ( rdw ) of 17.2 ( normal 11.6 - 13.7% ) . 
 other biochemical abnormalities were high serum cholesterol of 6.9 mmol / l ( normal 3.6 - 6.8 
  hypo - thyroidism was diagnosed . in the light of the patient 's diagnosis  
 a second history was taken which showed that she suffered from other symptoms of hypothyroidism such as  dry skin  generalised weakness  excessive sleeping  hoarse voice  and menorrhagia . 
 two months after the initiation of therapy  the patient had no more dysarthria or other associated symptoms . 
 dysarthria is a disturbance of articulation that may be caused by a neuromuscular lesion  or an abnormality of the vocal cords . 
 the first may result from damage to the central or peripheral nervous system such as head trauma  brain stem infarction  bulbar palsy  motor neuron disease  peripheral neuropathy  huntington 's chorea  parkinson 's disease  multiple sclerosis  myasthenia gravis  or muscle disease.4 the second may be attributable to congenital  traumatic  inflammatory  tumors  or post - operative lesions of the vocal cords . 
 these causes were unlikely in this patient  because she showed no associated clinical features of these diseases besides the normal neurological examination and investigations . 
 other causes such as congenital or aquired storage disorders such as amyloidosis  and such endocrine disorders as acromegaly or hypo - thyroidism3 as in the presented case  may lead to an enlargement of one or more of the components of the vocal cords.56 the most likely cause for the dysarthria in this patient was hypothyroidism . 
 this was supported by the abnormal thyroid functions and the response of the dysarthria to thyroxin . 
 dysarthria due to hypothyroidism had been reported only once previous to this case.3 the pathophysiology of dysarthria in hypothyroidism can be explained by edematous swelling of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal structures in combination with macroglossia.3 it has been shown that macroglossia in hypothyroidism is caused by a thickening of the epithelial tissue.6 these changes can also explain the choking and the dysphagia which this patient experienced . 
 there have been a few reports of hypothyroidism responsible for secondary dysphagia.1012 her sleep apnea may also be a manifestation of hypothyroidism  most likely caused by edema and myopathy.7 sleep apnea attributable to hypothyroidism is reversible with thyroxin replacement therapy.8 the episodic hoarseness of voice can also be explained by hypothyroidism1 as well as the delayed recovery from anaethesia the year before  most probably the result of undiagnosed hypothyroidism.91314 unfortunately  thyroid function tests had not been performed on our patient at that time . 
 iron deficiency anemia in this patient was due to menorrhagia  which is one of the characteristic features of the disease.1 hyperlipidaemia may also be due to hypothyroidism  a known association.1 clinical implication of the presented patient was that dysarthria may be the presenting symptom of hypothyroidism  even if other symptoms had been present for a long time . 
 hypothyroidism as the cause of dysarthria was confirmed with the discovery of additional symptoms in the patient 's history . 
 otolaryngeal symptoms should therefore be considered possible symptoms of hypothyroidism.15 prompt recovery of dysarthria is expected after hormone replacement therapy .","

1) Abstract: 
Hypothyroidism, a common endocrine disorder, can present with dysarthria as its only symptom. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy can rapidly resolve this symptom.

2) Research and Discussion: 
A 39-year-old female presented with dysarthria and subsequent testing revealed marked hypothyroidism and positive antibody tests. Thyroid hormone replacement resulted in resolution of dysarthria and other otolaryngological symptoms.

3) Results and Conclusion: 
Dysarthria may be a presenting symptom of hypothyroidism, especially when confined to the otolaryngological region. This highlights the importance of considering endocrine disorders as a potential cause of dysarthria and the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy in resolving symptoms. "
"bicipital groove ( bg ) is an indentation on the anterior aspect of proximal part of humerus . 
 this groove allows tendon of long head of biceps brachi muscle enveloped in synovial sheath and ascending branch of anterior circumflex humeral artery to pass through it . 
 it is bounded medially by lesser tubercle  laterally by greater tubercle  and superiorly by bridging of transverse humeral ligament /muscle fibers of subscapularis  supraspinatus and pectoralis major muscles [ 2  3 ] . this groove with transverse humeral ligament / muscle fibers bridging it provides stability and smooth functioning of tendon of long head of biceps brachi muscle and prevents its subluxation during multidirectional biomechanical movements of arms . 
 apart from this  the greater function of biceps brachi muscle whose tendon is enshrined in bicipital groove is suppination  flexion  and screwing biomechanical movements . on motion of humerus  
 the proximal humerus moves in relation to fixed biceps tendon which is firmly held in place at the level of intertubercular sulcus by tuberosities and humeral transverse ligament . with elevation of arm 
  humerus moves about 3.8  cm on the fixed tendon . in the dynamics of external rotation to internal rotation  the tendon is forced medially against lesser tubercle and superiorly against transverse humeral ligament . 
 coracohumeral ligament directly overlies the transverse humeral ligament / muscle fibres and is continuous with rotator cuff . 
 morphometry of bg may influence the functions of surrounding structures leading to various pathological conditions [ 8  9 ] . 
 supratubercular ridge originally described by meyer in 1928   and later by hitchcock and bechtol in 1948   consists of bony protuberance and is continuous with superior aspect of lesser tuberosity . 
 it allows the tendon a more gradual change in direction as it enters the bicipital groove by elevating and forcing it laterally . 
 therefore  incidence of spurs and supratubercular ridge in indian population through this study has also been observed . 
 apart from this  the bicipital groove is important landmark for replacement of prosthesis of shoulder . 
 thus knowledge of bg is highly useful in prosthetic sizing  positioning  and designing . 
 bicipital groove also acts as an important landmark for placement of lateral fin of prosthesis in shoulder arthroplasty and humeral head replacement in fractures of upper end of humerus . in a series of classic reports by various authors  the papers in [ 4  1215 ] 
 have discussed primary versus secondary biceps tendinitis and different treatment regimens for each of these entities [ 16  17 ] . 
 the association of shoulder pain with pathology of the lhb is currently attributed to inflammation ( synovitis )  impingement  prerupture  or instability of the tendon at the entry into the bicipital groove ( subluxation or dislocation ) [ 16  1824 ] . 
 lesions affecting the tendon of lhb brachii have been postulated to be among the most frequent causes of pain and disability in the shoulder . 
 this pain may be caused by rotator cuff  supraspinatus  and biceps tendon diseases . 
 pathologies of the biceps tendon can be broadly divided into two classes  namely  as follows . 
 primary tendonitis : berlemann and bayley   reported the long term results of 14 patients ( 15 shoulders ) following keyhole biceps tenodesis . 
 fifty - three percent of patients had previously undergone a subacromial decompression but symptoms persisted until the biceps tenodesis was carried out . 
 this would suggest that biceps tendinitis is a primary event.secondary tendonitis [ 14  15  17  27 ] : this may further be subdivided into three main types  inflammatory  instability  and traumatic . 
 clearly  there is a huge overlap between these categories and in fact biceps pathology is very rarely a single entity . apart from this  the most recent biomechanical data come from youm et al .   who found that loading of the long head of biceps tendon significantly affects the glenohumeral joint  range of movement  translations  and kinematics . 
 therefore  varied anatomical knowledge of the bg is important as abnormalities of the bicipital tendon and its synovial sheath have been implicated in a variety of causes of shoulder pain and disability [ 6  7 ] . 
 a radiological study recommended that the entire length of the bg be examined to determine the osseous anatomy of the groove . 
 few authors have studied the morphology of the upper end of the humerus in geographically diversified regions [ 10  3133 ] .

 the most recent biomechanical data come from youm et al .   who found that loading of the long head of biceps tendon significantly affects the glenohumeral joint  range of movement  translations  and kinematics . 
 therefore  varied anatomical knowledge of the bg is important as abnormalities of the bicipital tendon and its synovial sheath have been implicated in a variety of causes of shoulder pain and disability [ 6  7 ] . 
 a radiological study recommended that the entire length of the bg be examined to determine the osseous anatomy of the groove . 
 few authors have studied the morphology of the upper end of the humerus in geographically diversified regions [ 10  3133 ] . 
 hence an attempt has been made to examine the length  width  depth  and opening angle of bicipital groove statistically to correlate with clinical implications in north indian population along with a review of the literature . 
 the study was carried out using hundred and one humeri of assorted sex and pair . 
 the subjects consisted of 45 left and 56 right humeri obtained from osteology laboratory of kg medical university  lucknow  up  india . 
 the lengths of medial  lateral walls  depth  lengths  and width of bicipital groove ( figure 1 ) were measured by digital vernier callipers . 
 the statistical analyses consisting of not only incidences of supratuberecular ridge of meyer and presence of bony spurs but also mean  standard deviation  range  median and mode of length of medial and lateral walls  width  depth  and opening / medial wall angles of bg were carried out . 
 the opening / medial wall angles of bg ( figure 2 ) have been computed . 
 the narrowness and shallowness of bg have been redefined objectively in relation to dimensions of both bicipital groove and biceps tendon for adequate prediction of pathologies of biceps tendon . though the precise definition of narrowness / shallowness of bg is difficult yet systematic  relative and constrained definition depending on the dimensions of bicep tendon and its natural abode  that is  bicipital groove  
 is formulated as follows.if the width of bg is less than the width of biceps tendon  it is a narrow bg which may produce attritional changes causing impingement  inflammation  and degeneration . 
 similarly  if the depth of the groove is less than height of the bicep tendon  it is shallow causing subluxation or dislocation which in the long run may cause degenerative changes and rupture . if the width of bg is less than the width of biceps tendon  it is a narrow bg which may produce attritional changes causing impingement  inflammation  and degeneration . 
 similarly  if the depth of the groove is less than height of the bicep tendon  it is shallow causing subluxation or dislocation which in the long run may cause degenerative changes and rupture . as the new definition of narrowness or shallowness requires the width and height of biceps tendon  so the width and height of 4 biceps tendons from 2 cadavers 
 have also been measured to provide more realistic definition of narrow / shallow of bicipital groove . 
 the means  standard deviation of lengths of medial and lateral walls  width  depth and opening / medial wall angles of bg have been computed as shown in table 1 . mean length of medial wall of bg on right side was 22  4 and that on left side was 23  5  mm ( table 1 ) . 
 mean length of lateral wall of bg on right side was 31  6  mm and that on left side was 31  5  mm . 
 mean width on the superior part of bg on right side was 8  2  mm and that on left side was 8  2  mm . 
 the depth of bg on right side was 5  1  mm and that on left side was 6  1  mm . 
 the incidence of supratubercular ridge was 37% total  17% on right side  and 20% on left side . 
 the average length of bg is 26.7% of total length of the humerus and average width of bg is 52% of average width of humerus . 
 the width and height of biceps tendon ( figure 3 ) have been displayed in table 2 . 
 the morphometric study carried out by various authors [ 25  3437 ] has been compared with present study as depicted in table 3 . 
 lengths of medial wall and lateral walls of bg have not been reported so far except in the present study  so there is no data for comparison . 
 length of bg in present study is comparable with that of murlimanju but slightly higher than that observed by wafae et al . 
 the width of bg under present study is close to that of cone et al . 
 but slightly higher than that of murlimanju and lower than that of wafae et al . 
 median of width of bg on right and left sides are 8 and 10  mm  respectively  and mode is 8  mm on each side . 
 it indicates that width of bg in most of the north indian population is 8  mm . in the present study depth of bg more than 3 
 mm and depth ranging 46  mm are 98% and 96% of humeri  respectively  as against 90% and 86% in the study of cone et al . 
 median and mode of depth in right / left side are 5/6  mm each . 
 medial wall angle of bg is slightly higher than that of joseph and lower than cone et al . 
 medial wall angle ( mwa ) in my study is lower than cone and higher than joseph . 
 the median and mode of these morphometric parameters of bg are very useful for prosthetic sizing  positioning  and designing .   the supratubercular ridge in present study 
 is found in 17% in right and 20% in left totalling to 37% in all humerii . as per hitchcock and bechtol 
 cone et al .   from their radiographic interpretations observed this ridge in 50% of cases and reported that it was not pathologically significant . 
 observed this ridge in 88% on right side and 57% on left side and emphasised that it was more important on right side than left to prevent medial displacement of long head of biceps from the bg . 
 in present study mean width and height of biceps tendon ( figure 3 ) are 10.5 and 1.6  mm  respectively  which is higher than that observed by lam and mok . 
 similarly these dimensions of tendon at the exit from bg are 7 and 1.8  mm  respectively . 
 the width of tendon at the exit is more and height is less than that observed by lam and mok . 
 if the tendon is not encased by median and lateral walls of bg due to its shallow depth it may be dislocated  either partially or fully by biomechanical movements of arms . 
 this dislocation of biceps tendon associated with impingement may cause degeneration leading to partial or full rupture with the passage of time . apart from this  
 if the movements of tendon are not free in narrow or in presence of bony spurs in bg during biomechanical movements of shoulder joint  its constant fraying might give rise to pathologies of biceps tendon . 
 reported that wide grooves ( i.e.  > 17  mm ) were often shallow . 
 but in a groove 3  mm deep or less  it should be viewed with suspicion in managing pathologic conditions of the shoulder on patient radiographs as per cone 's view . 
 pfahler et al .   found a flat groove angle associated with radiologic depth less than 2  mm . 
 they found a significant accumulation of pathologically changed biceps tendons when a flat groove angle was present . according to several authors subluxation and dislocation of biceps tendon were more common in presence of shallow bicipital groove [ 1  4  5  7  39 ] . 
 it is also reported that with shallow bicipital groove  the tendon is susceptible to chronic trauma due to impingement by the overlying acromion  rotator cuff  and coracoacromial arch during shoulder movement . 
 a shallow intertubercular groove is vulnerable to impingement damage and subluxation [ 37  40 ] . 
 rupture of the biceps tendon most commonly occurs proximally near the glenoid labrum and distally in the bicipital groove . 
 smith   designated bicipital groove types as narrow  normal and shallow depending on mean opening angle less than 66  94  and 118.   as seen from above description  the objective and realistic definition has not been given by any author . therefore  present author has attempted reliable  realistic  and objective definition of shallowness of bg in relation to biceps tendon as given in section 2 of this paper . 
 this definition of shallowness can be realised in situ in live patients only but is expected to elucidate the pathologies associated with shallowness of the groove . as per morphometric data ( table 3 ) of bg and biceps tendon as observed in two cadavers in the present study  the groove is not shallow according to new definition of shallowness . 
 figure 3 shows the biceps tendon and bg in a dissected cadaver wherein the biceps tendon is positioned and perfectly well protected in bg . 
 the bg in this case is not shallow as seen in the above - mentioned figure  and the height of biceps tendon is less than depth of bg . 
 continual mechanical stress at anatomically narrow sites ( i.e.  distal bicipital groove  beneath the acromion or the coracoacromial ligament ) and impingement of the biceps tendon in the coracoacromial arch during flexion may cause these well - known degenerative changes [ 19  41 ] . in the present study the data of bg and biceps tendon observed from two cadavers 
 do not indicate narrow bg as per new definition of narrowness and shallowness given in section 2 . 
 did not find any conspicuous anatomic findings of the bicipital groove in the shoulders effected by rotator cuff diseases on mri such as a narrow groove  flat groove  or small medial groove that were predictive of biceps pathology at the time of arthroscopy [ 37  38 ] . 
 this may be because of the following limitations of josheph 's study  subjective / qualitative definition of shallowness and narrowness 
 . limitations of josheph 's study  subjective / qualitative definition of shallowness and narrowness . 
 the limitations to josheph 's study were as follows : clearly a selection bias to surgical patients suffering from primary rotator cuff disease  only patients having mri done  classification of biceps tendon pathology was arbitrary and based purely on visual inspection not on histopathologic changes  mri is often considered to be less accurate than x - ray or computed tomography scan in evaluating bony dimensions . clearly a selection bias   to surgical patients suffering from primary rotator cuff disease  only patients having mri done  to surgical patients suffering from primary rotator cuff disease    only patients having mri done  classification of biceps tendon pathology was arbitrary and based purely on visual inspection not on histopathologic changes    mri is often considered to be less accurate than x - ray or computed tomography scan in evaluating bony dimensions . 
 lesions due to pathology of biceps tendon have been postulated to be among the most frequent causes of pain and disability in the shoulder . 
 biceps tendon pathology has been visualized in three main categories  namely  instability  inflammatory  and traumatic . 
 abboud et al .   divided the biceps tendon pathology in normal  inflamed  partially torn  or ruptured tendon . 
 acute inflammatory and chronic degenerative alterations causing partial / complete rupture and subluxation / dislocation can be found in the long head of the biceps tendon . 
 instability of biceps tendon besides other factors may be attributed to length of medial / lateral walls  opening / medial wall angles depending on width / depth constituting shallowness of bg  and presence of supratubercular ridge [ 37  40  41 ] . 
 the implication of longer walls is expected to ensure greater stability to biceps tendon lying in the bicipital groove than the shorter walls during multidirectional biomechanical movements . 
 but the rider to this fact is that it may also cause attritional friction in a longer length of biceps tendon surrounded by longer walls creating inflammation under narrow conditions of bg . 
 as the lengths of medial and lateral walls decrease  the instability increases and the tendon is likely to be damaged . the inference drawn is based on reconstruction of anatomical model of this part of the human body advancing the knowledge and experience of anatomy and clinical studies recorded in the literature supported by logical force as the study is on dry bones . 
 range provides an idea of length of these walls in north indian population  whereas the mean  sd reveals the average size of bg 
 . the median may be very useful in planning surgical procedures in this part of the body . 
 mode is representative of most frequent incidence of lengths of these walls in the subject population . 
 if the instability of biceps tendon is studied in relation to lengths of bg most frequent value of length of walls may play a vital role in diagnostics of tendon instability or attritional damage . 
 felt that a groove 3  mm deep or less and more than 17  mm wide may predispose to tendon subluxation or dislocation on patient radiographs . 
 the flat groove of pfahler et al .   was found to depict significant accumulation of pathologic changes in biceps tendon in 62% of cases on sonography . 
 the supratubercular ridge of meyer and a prematurely shallow bicipital or intertubercular sulcus have been postulated to result in a variety of lesions after repetitive use or acute trauma [ 37  40  41 ] . these include acute or chronic peritendonitis  varying degrees of attrition or damage to the tendon  and subluxation or complete dislocation . as the biceps tendon 
 is enshrined in bg  width may influence the pathology occurring in this tendon . in wider groove the tendon 
 the morphometry of the bicipital groove in terms of length of media wall  lateral wall  length of bg  width  depth medial wall angle  and opening angle has been elucidated with reference to north indian population.the data on morphometry of bg will be of utmost use for anatomist  radiologists  orthopaedic surgeons  and physicians.the new definition of narrow / shallow bg has been given .

Abstract:
This study analyzes the morphometry of the bicipital groove and its association with pathologies of the biceps tendon in the North Indian population. It includes a review of the literature and measurements of various dimensions from 101 humerii.

Research and Discussion:
The data gathered from this study provides a new definition of narrow/shallow groove and supports the role of bicipital groove morphology in the development of biceps tendon pathologies. It also highlights the importance of this knowledge for anatomists, orthopedic surgeons, and physicians in the management of shoulder pain.

Results and Conclusion:
The average dimensions of the biceps tendon and bicipital groove from two cadavers were found to be 1.8mm, 10.5mm, 11.3mm, and 5.5mm, respectively. These results provide valuable information for surgical procedures in this region and future studies on the bicipital groove morphology in relation to biceps tendon pathologies. Overall, this study emphasizes the significance of understanding the variant morphometry of the bicipital groove in the North Indian population."
"five of the world s most fatal work safety accidents in the past decade ( 20012010 ) occurred in china ( 1 ) . 
 work safety accidents has become the first cause of deaths of chinese citizens below 44 yr old ( 2 ) . 
 work safety accidents pose a great threat to people 's life  especially major accidents  defined as ones that result in at least 10 deaths . 
 the chinese government has established a surveillance system for monitoring work safety accident since 2001 under state of saws ( 3 )  which is the only authority system for work safety accidents inquiry in china . 
 injuries related to transportation  mining  fire  explosion had the majority of occurrence ( 46 )  and the most accidents occurred in construction on certain geographic regions of china ( 7  8) . 
 previous researches had focused on the characteristics of work safety accidents  while there is very few research analyzing major accidents with mass casualties .

 economic development is related to the incidence of accident . in developing countries such as china  
 increases in the growth rate of economic may have caused work safety accident rate to rise ( 9 ) . in china  both major work safety accidents and deaths 
 appear to have decreased since 2006  while the growth rate of gdp shows an increase steadily ( varying in the range of 7.8% to 14.2% ) ( 10 ) . 
 efforts in regulations and surveillance  safety initiatives and innovations in safety controls by chinese government can attribute to the decline . to improve the whole country s work safety  
 chinese government has issued a series of supervision regulations especially for fatal serious work safety accidents  such as fire regulation  transportation regulation  coal mine and non - coal mine regulations  and the 11 five - year plan for national economic and social development of the people s republic of china ( 11 ) . as part of this move 
  chinese government has also strengthened the penalties for fatal major work safety . as the formulation and implementation of the regulations  provinces have made great improvements in preventing serious and major accidents . 
 the number of accidents and deaths show a sharp drop in ten years  which are broadly consistent with other published studies ( 1217 ) . 
 while there has been a decline in the frequency of accidents and deaths in recent years  the mortality rate was still relatively high . according to zhang et al . 
 ( 12 )  the risk of death was 6.1 per million populations in work safety in whole country  which was higher than other countries ( 18 ) . using hierarchical cluster analysis 
  we recognized that provinces of hunan  guizhou  henan  shanxi reported the highest number of major accidents and deaths  while provinces of shanghai  qinghai  hainan  ningxia  beijing  tianjin reported the least  which is consistent with the regional distribution of work safety accidents in whole country ( 12 ) . 
 after detailed analyzing  we found that hunan  guizhou  henan and shanxi had more than 55 major accidents  resulting in more than 900 deaths . among these accidents  mining and transportation contributed to the majority  accounting for more than 89% of all . 
 these statistics may relate to the differences in natural environment  working conditions  the level of economic development and economic patterns . 
 this percentage is comparable with the other published studies of work safety accidents in china ( 19  20 ) . 
 based on counts and proportions of accidents  transportation and mining that mostly produce casualties were still high - risk industrial safety accident types in china . in transportation section 
 data analysis revealed that one major road traffic accident occurred every 10 days on average in china  while the average number of deaths in aviation was 49.5 . 
 this may be an important reason why fewer aviation accidents caused more widespread concern in the international community . 
 road transportation regulations of people 's republic of china was issued at the end of 2004 ( 21 )  and efforts were made to better disseminate the regulation  safety procedures  and tips to operators to increase drivers awareness of risk and to improve emergency response capabilities . to reduce traffic accidents  some prevention strategies including driver training  working conditions  weather conditions  hours - of - service regulations  and safety culture should be better considered ( 2225 ) . in mining section  coalmine accidents contributed to the majority . 
 literature reported that coal - mine accidents in china occurred ten times more frequently than that in india ( 1 )  and the death rate per million tons was 6.66 during the past 24 yr  which was ninety - four times more larger than in america ( 0.07 ) ( 26 ) . 
 the distribution and exploitation of mineral resources are an important factor for the significant difference between china and america . 
 fortunately  with the provisions on the prevention of coal mine accidents at the end of 2005 ( 27 ) and the closure of half of the operating mines in 2006  the death rate per million tons showed a rapid decline since 2006 ( 26 )  and the number of mining accidents and deaths including major mining accidents declined . 
 however  several safety concerns still persist in some mines  such as ignoring safety professionals  lack of emergency rescue measures and employee professional safety training . 
 some effective interventions are needed to mitigate the worst health and safety performance in china . 
 this study used death per incident and death injury ratio as a surrogate measure to describe the severity of major accidents and the urgency of emergency rescue . 
 the declines in the number of death per service and mining accident indicated improvement on the special intervention . 
 however  obstacles exist in transportation  construction and manufacturing intervention . as show in fig . 
 4  the occurrence of tailing dam accident associated with major casualties and economic losses  and it will cause high case - fatality once occurred . like tailing dam incident  collapse  
 therefore  full risk assessment and prevention measures are the primary intervention to prevent these accidents . 
 aviation and railway accidents were recognized to result in relatively higher case - fatality and higher number of occupational injuries . 
 we discussed the major work safety accidents nationwide and the severity and emergency rescue urgency of accident using a scatter plot by death per accident and death injury ratio  the improvement compared with the similar studies ( 7  12 ) . 
 additionally  we searched the published literature and statistical yearbook to supplement the detailed information . 
 the information registered in the saws system were not comprehensive  such as the cause of per incident  thus we could not do further analyze . 
 ten years work safety data indicate that the frequency of incidents and number of deaths of major work safety accidents were declined . 
 ethical issues ( including plagiarism  informed consent  misconduct  data fabrication and/or falsification  double publication and /or submission  redundancy  etc ) have been completely observed by the authors .","

1) Abstract:
This study provides a national profile of major work safety accidents in China, finding a decline in accidents and deaths in recent years. Transportation and mining industries have the highest number of accidents and deaths.

2) Research and Discussion:
Data from 2003-2012 census of major work safety accidents were collected and analyzed. The frequency of accidents and deaths, as well as geographic distribution and injury types were studied. The severity and urgency of emergency rescue by accident types were also discussed.

3) Results and Conclusion:
A total of 877 major work safety accidents resulted in 16,795 deaths and 9,183 injuries. The mortality rate and incidence of major accidents have declined, but safety concerns remain in certain industries. Transportation and mining have the highest number of accidents and deaths, while major aviation and railway accidents caused more casualties per incident."
"previously described growth conditions including those for inducing development were used for a. nidulans [ 17  18 ] . 
 expression of anea via niia promoter is induced by 0.6% sodium nitrate and repressed by 0.2% ammonium tartrate . 
 an anea disruption cassette ( dc ) was constructed according to methods described by yu et al . . 
 using genomic dna prepared from a. nidulans fgsc a4  dna fragments for the dc were amplified by pcr by using appropriate primer sets ( anea - a1/-a2  anea - b1/-b2  and argb - for/-rev ) . 
 the complete dc was amplified by a nested - pcr primer set ( anea - c1/-c2 )  purified  and then used to transform the tj1 strain . 
 nucleic acid preparation and northern blot analysis were performed as described previously . for southern blotting  
 genomic dna was treated with appropriate restriction enzymes and then separated on 1% agarose gels . 
 the gels were washed with distilled water ( dw ) and soaked twice in a depurination solution ( 250 mm hcl ) for 15 min . after the reaction  the gel was washed with dw again and then soaked in denaturation solution ( 1.0 m nacl and 0.4 m naoh ) for 1 hr . the genomic dna contained in the processed gel was transferred onto a hybond - n membrane ( amersham biosciences  pittsburg  pa  usa ) .

 the dc for deletion of the anea gene was constructed and used to transform the recipient strain . 
 southern blot analysis of pst i - digested genomic dna from candidate strains with a pcr - amplified probe specific for the 5'-flanking region of anea confirmed the deletion of the chromosomal anea gene by revealing an expected band of 5.7 kb ( fig . 
 1 ) . to investigate the function of anea in development of a. nidulans  the pattern of hyphal growth including radial growth  septation  and asexual sporulation were examined in one of the deletion mutant strains . 
 however  we observed no differences between the wild - type and deletion mutant ( data not shown ) . 
 these results indicated that -cop is not essential for the viability of a. nidulans ; these results are similar to those obtained in yeasts . 
 recently  copi proteins were reported to play roles in responses to er stress and thermal stress in yeast [ 11  13 ] . here 
  we tested the effect of -cop deletion on sensitivity to environmental stresses caused by treatment of the fungi with several drugs that are known to exert adverse effects on cellular processes related to the stress response . 
 no detectable changes were observed in the -cop - defective strain by treatment with drugs including inhibitors of cell - wall biosynthesis ( calcofluor white  congo red  and caspofungin )  n - glycosylation ( tunicamycin )  ergosterol biosynthesis ( terbinafine )  and glycerol biosynthesis ( fludioxonil )  an inducer of apoptosis ( farnesol )  and a ca chelator ( egta ) . 
 thermal stress  which makes the -cop - defective yeast strain unviable  showed no effect on viability and vegetative growth in the -cop deletion strains ( data not shown ) . taken together  
 these results show that -cop in a. nidulans is neither essential for viability nor involved in stress responses unlike in yeast . in a. nidulans  a mutation in the sodc gene 
 copi depletion also results in the failure of cytokinesis and a reduction in the number of overlapping central spindle microtubules during meiotic divisions for spermatogenesis in drosophila . in the -cop - depleted ( anea ) a. nidulans strain  we observed no defects in asexual development ( data not shown )  but significant defects in sexual development ( fig . 
 even after culturing in conditions favorable for cleistothecium development  with hypoxic treatment with 1% glucose in the dark  the anea strain showed more than 50% decrease of fruiting body formation ( table 3 ) . 
 in addition  in 1% glucose without hypoxic treatment  fruiting body formation was almost completely abolished by -cop depletion . in 2% lactose without hypoxic treatment  which predominantly induces the formation of fruiting bodies  -cop depletion showed no deleterious effect on fruiting body formation ( table 3 ) . 
 because the effect of c - sources and hypoxic treatment was tested in the presence of 0.1% sodium nitrate as a nitrogen source  we tested 0.2% yeast extract  which preferentially induces sexual development  and found that the defect in fruiting body formation on 1% glucose without hypoxic treatment was recovered in anea deletion strain ( data not shown ) . 
 although further experiments are required to determine the underlying mechanisms  our results suggested that -cop plays a role in sexual development in a. nidulans under certain environmental conditions  possibly by affecting cytokinesis and/or construction of er - based spindle envelopes  as observed in fruit fly spermatogenesis . 
 our previous study showed that the c - terminal domains of both -cop and -cop are essential for their interaction  and that the n - terminal wd40 motif of -cop and the tpr region of -cop are involved in controlling the interaction between these two cops in a. nidulans . 
 we also reported that a. nidulans -cop can substitute for s. cerevisiae -cop functions in vivo . in yeast  -cop is known to stabilize the thermo - sensitive -cop mutation . 
 thus  over - expression of -cop confers viability to the -cop mutant at elevated temperatures . 
 therefore  we investigated whether the phenotype of the sodc1 mutant was suppressed by over - expression of anea in a. nidulans . when a prg3-ama1 plasmid containing the anea gene encoding -cop was introduced into the sodc1 mutant  over - expression of anea 
 however  over - expression of -cop could not rescue the thermo - sensitive phenotype of the sodc1 mutant at a non - permissive temperature ( 42 ) ( fig . 
 these results indicate that -cop is able to interact with -cop  but does not stabilize -cop at elevated temperatures unlike in yeast . in summary  our results indicate that -cop in a. nidulans is not essential but related to formation of the sexual reproductive organ in response to particular environmental factor(s ) . 
 it is worth highlighting that recent reports indicate that the function of the copi complex ( and its subunits ) is not confined to intracellular vesicular trafficking . 
 the copi complex is also involved in other cellular events such as chromosome disjunction in a. nidulans  male development in chicken embryos  er stress responses in yeast  association with calcineurin during heat stress  meiotic divisions for spermatogenesis in drosophila  induction of productive autophagy and cellular survival  intercompartmental trafficking of specific rnas in neuronal cells  and neurite outgrowth .

1) Abstract: -cop Interactor Anea+ Gene is Essential for Sexual Development in Aspergillus Nidulans.

2) Research and Discussion: Using gene-specific disruption, the deletion of -cop in A. nidulans resulted in a decrease in fruiting body production, without affecting vegetative growth. Over-expression did not rescue the mutant's growth defect, showing -cop's role in fruiting body formation.

3) Results and Conclusion: -cop is not essential for viability in A. nidulans, but plays a crucial role in sexual development. This highlights the importance of -cop in fungal reproductive processes and could potentially lead to further research on its function and potential for other organisms."
"the diagnosis and extent of resection in the management of hd depend on the sensitive and specific identification of ganglion cells.[13 ] however  documenting aganglionosis is often difficult and tedious on routine hematoxylin - eosin ( h and e ) stained sections . 
 acetylcholinesterase ( ache ) has evolved as the gold standard in diagnosing hd ; however  this histochemical analysis is technically challenging  and to date  has not gained worldwide utilization and applicability . 
 the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of calretinin immunostaining in the ganglionic and aganglionic hd colon biopsy specimens and correlate with the h and e  thereby exploring its utility in suspicious cases of hd . 
 our standard protocol of care for a child presenting with hd is barium enema study at presentation followed by a laparotomy where multiple biopsies are taken from the spastic aganglionic segment  transition zone  and the normal colon . 
 a colostomy is sited at the level of the junction between the normal colon and the transition zone . 
 the definitive surgery of choice is duhamel 's pull - through after 6 months of age . 
 thirty - six were full - thickness rectal biopsies ( for suspected hd ) and 24 were bowel segments resected during the definitive pull - through surgery . 
 calretinin ( monoclonal mouse antihuman antibody ( dako )  ( clone : dak  calret 1  code : ir627 ) immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) staining was done on all paraffin - embedded blocks after routine h and e examination . 
 the age of patients ranged from 1 day to 14 years ( mean 8.2 months )  and there were 46 boys and 14 girls ( m : f = 3.2 - 3.3:1 ; normal ratio 3:1 - 4:1 ) . 
 twenty - three patients ( 63.8% ) presented at less than 1 month of age . 
 five ( 8.3% ) had long segment disease  6 ( 10% ) had total colonic aganglionosis . during the analysis of 36 initial full - thickness colon biopsy specimens  h and e staining revealed absence of ganglion cells ( negative ) in 19 cases ( 52.7% )  presence of ganglion cells ( positive ) in 2 cases ( 0.05% )  and suspected presence of ganglion cells in 15 cases ( 41.6% ) . 
 of the 19 cases reported negative through h and e staining  17 ( 47.22% ) were reported negative  and 2 ( 0.05% ) positive for calretinin histochemistry for the ganglion cells and nerve fibers [ table 1 ] . 
 hematoxylin and eosin staining versus calretinin in rectal biopsies in 15 patients  the h and e sections were suspicious of a presence of ganglion cell . 
 calretinin ihc showed immunopositivity in 3 slides  whereas 5 slides showed immunopositivity in nerve fibers . among the 5 slides 
 positive for nerve fibers  in 2 of the cases ( 2/60 )  calretinin gave a slight positive staining of nerve fibers  but with no staining of other areas . 
 the slight calretinin positivity in the 2 specimens was observed in some large bundles with no staining in other areas  and thus indicating the beginning of transition zone . in the 24 patients where resected specimens from the definitive surgery were sent  serial biopsies were taken from the aganglionic segment  transition zone  and the ganglionic segment [ table 2 ] . 
 calretinin was not expressed in the ganglion cells and nerve fibers of submucosal and myenteric plexus of 24 aganglionic ( spastic ) segments . in the transition zone  
 calretinin staining was positive in the ganglion cells in 20 cases ( 83.3% ) and was focally positive in the nerve fibers of 22 cases ( 91.6% )  both in the submucosal and myenteric plexus . 
 in ganglionic bowel segments of hd  calretinin showed immunopositivity in > 90% of ganglion cells and nerve fibers of submucosal and myenteric plexus . 
 the histological diagnosis of hd is challenging  requiring the expertise of a senior pathologist and access to specialized techniques for handling frozen specimens for ache staining . 
 this makes the diagnosis of hd difficult in centers where cases are infrequent  causing a delay in the treatment of the child . 
 calretinin is proven to be highly sensitive for the presence of ganglion cells and nerve fibers . 
 this protein is involved in calcium transport ; and its absence allows accumulation of cytoplasmic calcium  causing excess neuroexcitability and ultimate neurodegeneration . 
 barshack  et al .  procured the colons of 10 patients with proven hd . 
 calretinin ihc was performed on sections from the aganglionic zone  ganglionic zone  and transition zone of these colons . 
 they identified calretinin staining in interstitial nerve fibres ( inf ) and ganglion cells in normal colon [ figures 1 and 2 ] and focal inf staining in 92% of transition zones . 
 in contrast  there was no inf or ganglion cell staining in the aganglionic zone . 
 it can be interpreted as positive or negative for immune reactivity reducing the ambiguity in diagnosis . in our study 
  in the rectal biopsy specimens  diagnosis was ambiguous in 15 patients on h and e examination . by using calretinin  
 immune positivity was demonstrated in 3 patients ( 3 for ganglion cells and 5 for nerve fibers ) ; thereby  ruling out hd in these patients . 
 hematoxylin and eosin section with ganglion cell ( arrow ) ( h and e  10 ) calretinin staining of ganglion cells ( h and e  40 ) guinard - samuel  et al .  have studied the largest number of suction biopsies using calretinin . 
 they have concluded that calretinin is accurate in proving the absence of ganglion cells  it is easy to interpret  and can replace ache to diagnose hd . 
 they  however  recommend that it should be used as an aid along with h and e examination  especially in ultrashort segment disease and transition zone specimens . in our study 
  we found that calretinin correlated with h and e examination in both rectal biopsies and the resected bowel specimens . in the rectal biopsy specimens  calretinin also aided in the diagnosis of 15 patients with ambiguous findings . 
 calretinin ihc is accurate in detecting the presence or absence of ganglion cells and holds several advantages such as follows : ( 1 ) it can be carried out on paraffin - embedded tissue sections ; ( 2 ) staining pattern is simple ; ( 3 ) binary pattern of interpretation ( negative or positive ) ; ( 4 ) it is cost effective . in the present study 
 it can serve as a valuable cost - effective diagnostic aid in the centers where ache enzyme histochemistry is not available .","

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of calretinin immunostaining in diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease. 60 cases were examined, with calretinin processing done on the paraffin-embedded blocks. Results showed that calretinin was a valuable diagnostic aid, especially in cases where acetylcholinesterase enzyme histochemistry was not available.

Research and Discussion: The study included 36 biopsy specimens and 24 resected specimens. In 19 of the biopsy cases, Hirschsprung's disease was diagnosed earlier using H&E staining. Calretinin was helpful in 15 cases where there was diagnostic uncertainty. In all 24 resected specimens, calretinin correlated with the findings on H&E staining. This suggests that calretinin can be used as a cost-effective diagnostic tool in centers where acetylcholinesterase enzyme histochemistry is not an option.

Results and Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate the usefulness of calretinin in diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease. It was able to confirm the presence of ganglion cells and nerve fibers, helping to differentiate between HD and other conditions. Calretinin can be a valuable diagnostic aid in centers where other methods may not be available, making it an important tool for accurate and timely diagnosis of HD."
"drug abuse is considered a critical health  related social and economic problem in most countries . in the last three decades  the world has experienced shocking figures expressing drug abuse prevalence in societies  esp . among teenagers and the youth . 
 united nation 's office of crime and drug abuse prevention has recently reported 185 million drug consumers world - wide and an increasing treatment demand all over the world . 
 iranian drug abuse prevention headquarter has estimated 4.5 million opium consumers in iran by the end of 2004 . in a study conducted by serajzadeh and feyzi in 21 iranian state universities  
 5.8% of the interviewed drug consumers claimed to be drug dependent  while 3.1% claimed a high drug dependency  making a total of 8.9% of a drug dependent university students . regarding the harmful pharmaceutical  social  legal  health and economic effects of drug abuse  the need for serious preventive action 
 one divides drug abuse prevention into three  comprehensive  selective and obligatory  categories . 
 other preventive strategies include life skills training ( lst )  information improvement  affective education  social influence and drug abuse resistance education . 
 life skills are abilities needed to provide the groundwork for effective stress management and presentation of positive behaviors . 
 these skills enable an individual to accept his social role responsibilities and to face others demands and expectations and daily interpersonal problems effectively without hurting himself or others . 
 the term  life skills  involves a big class of socio - psychological and interpersonal skills which help an individual to take conscious decisions  communicate effectively  improve his interactive and self - management skills and adopt an active healthy life - style . 
 life skills can organize personal  interpersonal and environmental actions in a way to lead to better health  which in turn leads to more physical  psychological and social comfort . 
 lst program aimed at drug abuse prevention is a new preventive strategy which primarily focuses on socio - psychological factors leading to drug abuse and mainly emphasizes the promotion of personal and social skills . 
 this program was first planned by gilbert and botvin from kernel university to prevent smoking abuse among teenagers in 1997 and was then used for alcohol and drug abuse prevention . 
 researchers have confirmed the positive influence of lst on drug abuse reduction  effective use of intelligence capacity  furthering self - confidence and ego improvement  prevention of aggressive behaviors and suicide and aids prevention . 
 lots of other investigations have also been conducted on other individual and social problems and their solution through lst . 
 studied the impact of lst on middle schoolers knowledge  insight and ability to adopt a healthy life - style . 
 findings reported a lower rate of smoking among those who attended the program compared with those who refused to attend . 
 eisen et al . showed a significant difference between pre- and post - test scores of 6239 students . in this study  
 drug abuse rate among the intervention group was significantly lower than the norm compared to the control group . 
 another study by botvin and griffin claimed the positive effect of lst on addiction prevention . 
 the same survey tested 4466 students of new york schools for 3 years to investigate the effectiveness of the cognitive - behavioral program of drug abuse prevention . 
 those who received at least 60% of the intervention program showed a significant drug abuse reduction . furthermore  qaderi indicated that training courses could reduce drug abuse tendency and affect addicts attitude . 
 one other survey was carried out by nazarpoor et al . on 243 students of tabriz medical university to investigate how lst affects an individual 's opinion toward drug abuse prevention . 
 besides  there was a change or rise in knowledge  insight and assertiveness skills rate after attending lst workshops . 
 a significant relationship was also observed between participants change of attitude toward drug abuse and the rise in social skills due to participation in workshops . 
 furthermore  a significant relationship was detected between major and gender and social skills promotion rate ( a greater change was observed among boys ) . 
 they concluded that due to its impact on cognitive skills development  attending lst workshops is necessary for all university students . 
 results of a survey in feredrick university in germany not only demonstrated the preventive effect of lst on non - smokers and non - drinkers  but also its great impact on smokers and drinkers . 
 moradi et al . investigated the effect of drug abuse resistance and prevention skills training on 181 workers of asalooyeh petrochemical company under two intervention and control groups . 
 results indicated the positive impact of training on the intervention group 's knowledge and insight  drug abuse resistance skills  self - efficacy and decision - making in preventive actions . in their study  barati et al . 
 showed the positive role of lst in the reduction of abstract norms encouraging drug abuse among university students . 
 this can prove the positive impact of assertiveness training program on modification of beliefs and abstract norms of the youth and also its great influential role in planning and performance of drug abuse prevention training programs  especially in universities . 
 the present study was aimed at investigating the effect of lst on promotion of drug abuse preventive behaviors among university students and stability of the results after a 4-year follow - up . 
 this field trial study was conducted using pre- and post - experimental design with the control group . 
 samples were 60 university students ( 50% male and 50% female ) entering university in different majors  selected through quota random sampling and assigned randomly into two equal intervention and control groups after matching . 
 the selection criterion included factors as : 
 being a student of gonabad medical universityentering the university in the second semester of 2007giving consent and being able to attend workshops . being a student of gonabad medical university entering the university in the second semester of 2007 giving consent and being able to attend workshops . 
 the intervention group took part in two one - day lst workshops held weekly . before the first workshop 
 four years after intervention ( in 2011 )  all examinees   except for 9 were tested again using the same instrument ( 4 from the intervention group and 5 from the control group ceased to continue with the study due to attrition ) . to control all the confounding variables all participants were under inspection during this period by researchers . 
 data were collected by the use of a researcher made questionnaire including : ( a ) demographic information : age  gender  major  father 's and mother 's educational level  father 's job and habitation . 
 ( b ) drug abuse preventive behaviors including : self - awareness  interactive skills  decisiveness  ability to say  no   problem - solving  ability to resist others illogical demands  stress management  familiarity with drug abuse side - effects and negative attitude toward drug abuse . 
 the questionnaire included the following items : 
 regarding self - awareness  items such as familiarity with the components of self - awareness  self - evaluation skills  knowledge of self - strengths and weaknesses  positive thinking abilities  positive ego development skills  relationship between self - esteem and drug abuse  self - esteem and endurance  features of tolerant people and factors affecting those features were investigatedthe domain of interactive skills investigated issues such as : knowledge of definition and objectives of communication  components of communication  communication barriers  ineffective interaction  effective listening  interpersonal relations and their importance and ways to improve themregarding decisiveness  saying  no  to others and resistance to others illogical demands  items such as : familiarity with basic concepts of assertiveness  interactive styles  types of assertiveness  cognitive barriers to assertiveness  crucial steps to behavior change  steps of assertive behavior  some advice on how to say  no  and some special techniques of assertive behavior were discussedproblem - solving domain paid to issues as familiarity with basic concepts in problem - solving  problem - centered coping  emotion - centered coping and steps to the problem - centered copingdecision - making skill involved familiarity with decision - making process  factors affecting decision  different styles of decision - making and steps to logical decision - makingcritical thinking domain studied items as knowledge of basic concepts in critical thinking  components of critical thinking and thinking instrumentsin the stress management domain  factors such as knowledge of the concept of stress and related factors  a model of application of coping strategies  stress symptoms and stress management strategies and their descriptions  self - cooling and adaptive introspections were investigateddrug abuse side - effects focused on types of drug  their mechanism and side - effects  risk factors and preventive factorsattitude toward drug abuse included items as general attitude toward addiction and drug abuse  social opinion about addiction  drug abuse as a solution to problems  addiction avoidance and addicts .

 the questionnaire was made by the use of related references  texts and expert panel . 
 eight experts on the field commented on the face and qualitative content validity of the questionnaire . 
 having taken the required permits  validation of the aims of the study  emphasizing the confidentiality of the results and attracting the trust and consent of the participants  data were collected through distribution of the questionnaires among the target group before and after lst workshops . as the study was of a pre- and post - test design  the questionnaires were encoded  so the examinees could be tested both before and after workshops and 4 years after educational intervention . 
 furthermore  to ensure one - way blindness of the intervention  pre - test and post - test were administered by an experienced test - taker who was unaware of the type of intervention . 
 workshops were held by four experts including two psychiatrists and two clinical psychology masters who had passed lst courses . 
 training techniques included lecturing  discussion  question and answer  role - play  modeling and handing out educational booklets .

 permission to data collection was gained from the research ethics committee of gonabad university of medical sciences . 
 their responses to the questionnaire were anonymous and all respondents participated in the study voluntarily . 
 51.6% of the samples were between 17 and 19 years and 38.3% were between 20 and 22 years and 10.2% were 23 - 24 . 
 50% of the participants were studying in public health  26.7% in nursing and 23.3% in the operation room and anesthesia . 
 regarding father 's educational level  10% had a primary school education  18.3% middle school education  35% diploma  20% aa  10% ba and 6.7% ma or higher . 
 as to mother 's educational level  13.3% had primary school education  38.3% middle school education  30% diploma  10% aa  8.3% ba or higher . considering father 's job  
 8.3% were jobless  33.3% workers and farmers  26.7% employees and 31.7% were self - employed . 
 nearly 66.7% of the participants resided in towns ( urban ) while 33.3% lived in villages ( rural ) [ table 1 ] . 
 descriptive data for demographic variables the independent t - test results indicated no significant difference between pre - test and post - test drug abuse preventive behaviors of control and intervention groups before intervention ( p < 0.36 )  but a significant difference was observed immediately after intervention ( p < 0.001 ) . in other words  
 lst could successfully promote drug abuse preventive behaviors or reduce risk factors leading to drug abuse [ table 2 ] . 
 comparison of drug abuse preventive behaviors based on independent t test before and after intervention and follow - up test administered also  paired t - test showed no significant difference between the control group 's pre- and post - intervention insight toward drug abuse prevention ( p > 0.05 )  but regarding the same factor  intervention group showed a significant change before and after intervention ( p < 0.001 )  which remained stable in the follow - up test administered after 4 years ( p < 0.01 ) [ table 3 ] . 
 comparison of drug abuse preventive behaviors based on paired t test before and after intervention and follow - up test administered chi - square test results detected no significant relationship between factors such as gender  age and major with drug abuse preventive behaviors ( p > 0.05 )  but demonstrated a significant relationship between father 's educational level and promotion of drug abuse preventive behaviors ( p < 0.05 ) in a way that father 's higher educational level led to participant 's more awareness of these behaviors . 
 also  participants whose fathers were clerks or employees thought more of tobacco as harmful than those whose fathers were workers or jobless  though the difference was not statistically significant ( p > 0.05 ) . 
 those inhabiting towns had more knowledge about decisive behaviors compared to villagers  but this difference was n't significant either ( p > 0.05 ) . 
 results showed that lst could either promote participant 's knowledge about drug abuse preventive behaviors or decrease risk factors leading to drug abuse as a significant post - test increase in the intervention group 's drug abuse preventive behaviors mean scores was observed . 
 the findings of this study is in line with the other studies  e.g.  zollinger et al .  botvin and griffin  botvin et al .  moradi et al . which confirmed the positive impact of lst on promotion of the intervention group 's insight  drug abuse resistance skills  self - efficacy and decision - making balance in preventive activities 
 also  barati et al . showed the effectiveness of lst on the reduction of abstract norms encouraging drug abuse among university students which can affirm the positive impact of training on modification of beliefs and abstract norms of the youth . 
 also  the mentioned factors of this study results show that are directly related to psychological capacity which can be improved through lst . 
 the findings of this study are also in line with those of bohler in feredrick university which demonstrated not only the preventive role of lst among non - smokers and non - drinkers but also its great impact on smokers and drinkers  and smith et al . who also claimed the significant impact of lst on leadership and management skills of the youth . 
 findings also confirm the results of the studies by samari and laalyphase who asserted that lst can promote one 's interactive skills and social acceptability which can in turn affect drug abuse preventive behaviors and valyany et al . who emphasized the importance of lst workshops as they can reduce drug abuse tendency . 
 the study results indicated that the intervention group 's observed pre- and post - intervention difference remained stable even in the follow - up test conducted 4 years after the main treatment . 
 this is in line with the findings of botvin and griffin who suggested that their 6-year - long educational program confirms the effectiveness of lst on drug abuse prevention and nazarpoor et al . which claimed a promotion in the participants knowledge and social skills and also a meaningful increase in the change of outlook toward drug abuse after attending workshops . 
 it seems as if the change in the outlook can in the long run reduce drug abuse tendency . 
 our study proved a significant positive relationship between father 's educational level and children 's knowledge of drug abuse preventive behaviors . 
 this confirms the findings of babayi that showed students whose parents had a higher academic level had better information about drug abuse . 
 probably families with higher academic levels have more potential skills and use various techniques to promote their children 's insight toward drug abuse . 
 this proves the crucial role parents play in forming a proper insight toward drug abuse and in turn in the formation of drug abuse preventive behaviors in their children . 
 our study included some limitations as some samples ceased to go on with the study or were not available for the follow - up test . 
 lst can promote interactive  decision - making  problem - solving  critical thinking and stress management skills and lead to more social acceptability  which in turn reduce drug abuse tendency . 
 it is recommended to plan and perform constant lst workshops as effective tools of drug abuse prevention in universities .","

Abstract:
This study assessed the effectiveness of life skills training on promoting drug abuse preventive behaviors among university students. A field trial experimental study was conducted on 60 students who were assigned to either an intervention or control group. Results showed a significant difference in drug abuse preventive behaviors between the two groups, with the intervention group maintaining positive behaviors four years after the intervention.

Research and Discussion:
Drug abuse is a growing social issue, especially among young individuals. This study aimed to address the increasing prevalence of drug abuse among school and university students by examining the impact of life skills training. The results of the field trial experimental study showed a significant improvement in drug abuse preventive behaviors among students who received the intervention, demonstrating the effectiveness of life skills training in this context.

Results and Conclusion:
The findings of this study highlight the important role of life skills training in promoting drug abuse preventive behaviors among university students. The intervention group showed a significant improvement in behaviors and this effect remained stable even four years after the intervention. These results suggest the need for implementing life skills training programs in educational settings to prevent drug abuse and promote healthier behaviors among students. Additionally, it was found that the father's educational level was significantly related to drug abuse preventive behaviors, emphasizing the importance of family factors in addressing this issue."
"q fever is a zoonotic disease that is caused by coxiella burnetii  a microorganism that frequently infects domestic ungulates  as well as wild mammals in many genera ( 1 ) . in animals  
 the disease is transmitted to humans incidentally by inhalation of aerosols from infected cattle and sheep ( 1  2 ) . in humans  c. burnetii infection may be asymptomatic  acute  or chronic . 
 chronic q fever is rare  with endocarditis presenting as the most common complication ( 1  3 ) . 
 q fever has been reported in almost every country  except new zealand ( 4 ) . in canada  
 burnetii antibodies ( 5 ) . in japan  60 to 84% of cattle with reproductive disorders are seropositive ( 6 ) . 
 a study conducted in southern france showed that 5 to 8% of endocarditis cases in humans were due to c. burnetii  and the prevalence of acute q fever was 50 cases per 100000 inhabitants ( 7 ) . 
 researchers have suggested that the incidence of q fever is chronically underestimated because clinical manifestations of the disease are often nonspecific or even absent . 
 therefore  concerns with the disease focus on the importance of detection ( 1  3  8) . in korea 
  there is a little information concerning the epidemiology of c. burnetii infection in either animals or humans . 
 a few cases of acute q fever in humans have been reported ( 9  10 ) . 
 we examined the prevalence of antibodies to c. burnetii in dairy cattle nationwide and in people for health screening in a rural area of korea  and used the data to evaluate the impact of q fever in both animals and humans in korea . 
 upon agreement with dairy owners  serum samples from 414 dairy cattle were collected on 31 farms from march to june  2001 . 
 serum was collected from people who visited kangwon national university hospital for health examinations between april and december 2002 . 
 the subjects were interviewed to confirm the absence of symptoms of respiratory tract infection during the preceding two weeks . 
 informed consent was obtained from all people for health screening and the animals are treated by the ethical guidelines of kangwon national univesity . 
 coxiella burnetii phase ii antigen ( nine mile whole - cell antigen ) was prepared as previously described at the national institute of infectious diseases ( niid ) in tokyo  japan ( 12 )  and dotted onto teflon - printed glass slides . 
 each serum sample was diluted 1:16 with phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs )  overlaid on the antigen dots  and incubated for 45 min at 37 in a moist chamber . 
 the slides were subsequently washed twice for 5 min in pbs plus 0.05% tween-20 and then incubated with a 1:1400 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate ( fitc)-conjugated rabbit anti - bovine igg ( sigma - aldrich  st .

 the slides were again washed twice using the same method and examined using fluorescence microscopy ( axioskop 2  zeiss  germany ) at 200 magnification . 
 all sera that produced positive or equivocal reactions at 1:32 were further analyzed using 2-fold serial dilutions up to 1:4096 . 
 approximately 10% of the sera were divided and tested concurrently at kangwon national university and at the niid for quality control of test reproducibility ; there was greater than 95% concordance between the results from the two laboratories .

 approximately 10% of the sera were divided and tested concurrently at kangwon national university and at the niid for quality control of test reproducibility ; there was greater than 95% concordance between the results from the two laboratories . 
 each province had a relatively high prevalence  ranging from 8.9 to 59.3% ; the overall national prevalence was 25.6% . 
 of the positive sera ( n=106 )  80 ( 75.5% ) had high antibody titers ( 1:256 ) . 
 the mean age of the subjects was 43.7 yr ( standard deviation 15.9  range 19 - 82 )  and the male - to - female ratio was 1:0.86 ( n=110:95 ) . 
 of these  one had a serum sample with a high antibody titer ( 1:512 )  and two had samples with low antibody titers ( 1:64 ) ( table 2 ) . 
 this study examined the seroprevalence of c. burnetii infection in cattle and people for health screening in korea . 
 the sera of cattle showed a high prevalence ( 25.6% ) of anti - c . 
 burnetii antibodies  with 75.5% of the positive sera having high titers ( 1:256 ) . 
 by contrast  the sera of healthy people showed a relatively low prevalence ( 1.5% ) of anti - c . 
 the sera of dairy cattle were collected regardless of the disease status of each animal  which is a limitation of this study . since we could not find an association between a history of reproductive failure and seropositivity of the cows because of the absence of the data on the disease status  no prediction concerning seropositive status and reproductive problems can be made . 
 however  c. burnetii infection is prevalent in all areas of korea ; every region had a seroprevalence above 8%  and the national prevalence was 25.6% . 
 moreover  the high prevalence of high - titer sera provides evidence that the disease might be very active in this country . in neighboring japan  the seroprevalence of c. burnetii in healthy cattle ranges from 2 to 46% ; in cattle with reproductive disorders  the range was 60 to 84% ( 6 ) . 
 reported that bovine placentitis was highly associated with the presence of c. burnetti ( 13 ) . 
 in addition  9% of abortions in goats are reported to be caused by this microorganism ( 14 ) . 
 this is the first report to provide data that suggest that c. burnetii infection might be one of the important causes of reproductive problems in cattle in korea . 
 further studies based on the isolation of c. burnetii are needed to elucidate the etiologic role of this microorganism in the reproductive problems of cattle in this country . 
 furthermore  the high seroprevalence of c. burnetii among cattle suggests the possibility of contamination of the environment around farms . 
 since c. burnetii is widely distributed in wild animals and ticks and causes q fever to humans ( 1  3 )  it is necessary to evaluate the environmental hazards associated with c. burnetii infection that may threaten public health in the near future . 
 in addition  the survey on the high - risk group such as farmers and butchers is strongly needed . 
 the finding that people in a rural area demonstrated a relatively low seroprevalence of c. burnetii  as well as lower titers  suggests that infection with this microorganism seems to be relatively low in the rural area of korea . in a previously published report 
 ( 11 )  less than 1% of both healthy people and patients with fever of unknown origin tested positive for anti - c . 
 another report showed none of the sera from 70 healthy people was reactive for c. burnetii antigen ( 15 ) . 
 recent data showed that 11 out of 448 healthy people were reactive ( 16 ) . 
 on the other hand  our group previously reported that only one of 88 patients with community - acquired pneumonia was diagnosed with q fever with an ifa assay using both phase i and ii antigens ( 18 ) . despite the low seroprevalence of c. burnetii in humans 
  we can not exclude the risk of q fever to individuals with high - risk occupations  such as farmers  veterinarians  and meat - processing workers  considering the high rate of infection observed in cattle in this study . 
 previous korean report showed two of 46 stock breeders had an antibody titer of 1:20 ( 15 )  and 5 sera from 202 abattoir workers reacted with phase ii antigen ( 16 ) . in conclusion  c. burnetii appears to be a highly prevalent pathogen in cattle in korea and  accordingly  the studies on the high - risk groups are needed to evaluate the seroprevalence for this organism in korea ."," ..


1) Abstract: This study reports on the seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, in dairy cattle and healthy individuals in Korea. Serum samples were collected from 414 dairy cattle and 205 people, and tested using an indirect microimmunofluorescence test. Results showed a high prevalence of 25.6% in cattle, but only 1.5% in people, indicating the need for further studies on high-risk groups.

2) Research and Discussion: The study found a high seroprevalence of C. burnetii in dairy cattle in Korea, with regional variations. Of the positive samples, 75.5% had high antibody titers, indicating a greater risk for infection. However, only a small percentage of people were seropositive, and most had low antibody titers. These findings highlight the importance of targeted studies to determine the potential risks of C. burnetii in high-risk groups.

3) Results and Conclusion: The overall seroprevalence of C. burnetii in cattle in Korea was 25.6%, with the majority of positive samples showing high antibody titers. In contrast, the prevalence in people was only 1.5%, with low antibody titers. This study emphasizes the need for further research to evaluate the risk of C. burnetii in high-risk groups in Korea, given the high seroprevalence in dairy cattle. "
"it occurs in more than 50% of patients and may reach 90% in certain types of cancers  especially in patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.1 anemia is defined as an inadequate circulating level of hemoglobin ( hb ) ( hb < 12 g / dl ) and may arise as a result of the underlying disease  bleeding  poor nutrition  chemotherapy  or radiation therapy . 
 preliminary studies suggest that survival and loco - regional control after radiation therapy  especially in head and neck cancers  may be compromised by anemia.24 anemia often worsens symptoms such as fatigue  weakness  and dyspnea  and thus may have a negative effect on quality of life ( qol ) and performance status in patients with cancer . 
 thus  to improve physical functioning  qol  and prognosis in patients with cancer  it would be reasonable to take a proactive approach in identifying populations who need treatment for cancer - associated anemia ( caa ) and provide timely management . 
 blood transfusion is an effective way to replace depleted hb within a short period  but the effect is  unfortunately  temporary and can cause serious adverse risks and increased mortality . in randomized clinical trials in patients with caa 
  erythropoiesis - stimulating agents ( esas ) produced significant increases in hb level  decreased transfusion requirements  and improved qol.57 however  30%50% of patients do not respond to such agents . 
 in addition  the use of esas often causes concern about severe adverse reactions.68 in several studies  esas were found to shorten overall survival time  or time to tumor progression in patients whose hb level reached more than 12 g / dl . 
 these studies included patients with different primary cancers  such as breast  lung  head and neck  cervix  and lymphomas.911 the lack of response to erythropoietin stimulation in patients with cancer is partly attributed to the functional iron deficiency state  in which the high rate of erythropoiesis exceeds the delivery of usable iron  despite adequate iron stores.12 absolute iron deficiency  in contrast  occurs when iron delivery is impaired because iron stores are depleted ( serum ferritin  < 100 ng / ml ; transferring saturation  < 20%).13 hepcidin  a peptide hormone produced by the liver  is up - regulated in chronic inflammatory states including cancer . 
 hepcidin inhibits iron transport across cell membranes  thus decreasing the accessibility of stored iron and gastrointestinal absorption of dietary iron  leading to an increased frequency of iron - restricted erythropoiesis.1416 many randomized trials examined the role of intravenous ( iv ) iron in addition to esas in the treatment of anemia in patients with cancer . 
 many of these studies showed improvement in esa response  time to maximal response  reduction in esa dose  and improvement in qol parameters ( when measured ) in favor of the combination over esas alone . 
 the observed benefit was independent of baseline iron parameters.1721 one study found a 36% reduction in the number of patients transfused.21 this pilot study assessed the efficacy and feasibility of iv iron monotherapy in patients with cancer who have anemia and who are undergoing treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy without the use of esas .

 all analyses were performed using sas version 9.1 ( sas institute inc  cary  nc  usa ) . 
 twenty - five patients ( 17 women and 8 men ) were eligible  consented  and included in the study ; their mean age ( standard deviation  [ sd ] ) was 56 years ( 13.0 years ) . 
 chemotherapy varied according to the primary cancer and included anthracycline  platinum  taxanes  cyclophosphamide  high - dose ifosfamide  vincristine  vinblastine  bleomycin  and others . 
 many of the included patients had their chemotherapy treatment as second- or third - line therapy . 
 patients characteristics  including age  primary tumor  and active anticancer treatment are summarized in table 1 . 
 one patient died during the study from his tumor ( after week 2 )  and five patients withdrew from the study because of inconvenience ( three after week 3  and two after week 4 ) . 
 nineteen ( 76.0% ) patients completed a minimum of three treatments  15 ( 60.0% ) completed nine treatments  and 14 ( 56.0% ) completed all twelve planned weekly treatments . 
 as seen in table 2  the mean hb level of the 25 patients at baseline was 9.6 g / dl ( median  9.9 g / dl ; range  6.9 g / dl10.9 g / dl ) . for the 15 patients who completed at least nine treatments  the mean change in their hb level was 1.7 g / dl ( median  1.1 g / dl ; range  1.9 g / dl to 3.2 g / dl ) . 
 for the 14 patients who completed the whole treatment period ( 12 weeks )  the mean hb level change was 2.1 g / dl ( median  1.3 g / dl ; range  0.2 g / dl to 4.6 g / dl ; p = 0.0007 ) . 
 eight ( 42.1% ) of the 19 patients who completed at least three iron infusions had a more than 1 g / dl increase in their hb level . 
 hemoglobin level changes for the 14 patients who completed twelve iron infusions are shown in figure 1 . 
 no iv iron - related adverse events were reported among patients during the study or the follow - up period . 
 tsat was monitored during the study period  and no patients had tsat levels increase to more than 50% . 
 the highest ferritin level among patients who completed at least nine iv iron treatments was 1170 ng / ml ; the mean level at the end of study period for the whole group was 379 ng / ml . 
 five ( 20.0% ) patients received blood transfusions and were considered treatment failures ( three after week 3  transfused at hb levels of 6.9 g / dl  7.8 g / dl  and 5.4 g / dl ; one after week 4  transfused at an hb level of 8.2 g / dl ; and one after week 9  transfused at an hb level of 7.2 g / dl ) . 
 low hb levels are associated with diminished qol and possibly decreased overall survival.2 successful treatment of anemia has undeniable benefits for patients  often yielding dramatic symptomatic improvement . 
 although the role of esas is well - established in treating caa  big concerns were recently raised about the negative effect of esas on survival in some patients with cancer.911 concerns about the risk for thromboembolism in patients with cancer with higher hb levels who are receiving esa were also addressed in many trials.2223 in addition  the possible immunosuppressive effects of blood product transfusions that may have relevance to neoplasia progression were addressed before.24  25 in our pilot study  we tested the feasibility of using iron supplementation alone to treat anemia in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy without the use of esas or blood transfusion  which could be a valid alternative  especially for patients with curable cancers . 
 oral iron is easier to administer and relatively inexpensive  but low patient adherence  poor enteral absorption  and poor tolerance because of a wide range of troublesome gastrointestinal adverse effects limit its overall effectiveness.26 anemia of chronic disease may occur in patients with cancer and is associated with an increase in hepcidin levels  which decreases oral iron absorption and bone marrow iron use  negating any possible effect of regular doses of oral iron.15 iv iron therapy significantly improves response to epoetin alfa when compared with oral iron or no iron in anemic patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy.1721 oral iron supplements with esas showed no significant benefit over esas alone in treating caa.21 sodium ferric gluconate and iron sucrose appear to have more favorable safety profiles over iron dextran . 
 a large prospective safety comparison trial failed to show serious anaphylactoid reactions27 which is confirmed in our study  in which no patients developed reactions and no patients withdrew from the study because of adverse effects . given that the mean hb increase using esas with iv iron in one large controlled trial was 2.4 g / dl21 the results obtained in our study are clinically significant . 
 these findings should be further confirmed and better assessed in larger studies  in which questions such as the optimal timing of iv iron therapy with respect to chemotherapy and the optimal total dose of iv iron should be determined . 
 the use of iv iron monotherapy was recently reviewed by a group in germany that studied the use of ferric carboxymaltose to replace esa and blood transfusions as a treatment for caa . 
 iron - deficient patients treated with ferric carboxymaltose alone ( n = 233 ) had a median of 1.4 g / dl increase in hemoglobin levels compared with those receiving additional treatment with esas ( n = 46 ; median  1.6 g / dl ) . our study  
 however  is peculiar in using iron therapy in a non - iron - deficiency state.28 iron overload after iv iron therapy  with potential concerns about the risk of developing secondary cancers and infection  might be raised . 
 the highest serum ferritin level in the present study in patients who completed at least 9 weeks of iv iron therapy was 1170 ng / ml . most of the literature addressing cancer and infections in iron - overloaded patients comes from patients with hemochromatosis or patients who are undergoing hemodialysis . 
 published reviews report an increase in hepatocellular carcinoma only in patients with hemochromatosis after they develop cirrhosis.29 similarly data supporting the association between iv iron therapy and higher infection rate are weak and not well - supported.30 in fact  anemia itself is a risk factor for infections in patients receiving hemodialysis.31 a multivariate analysis of associations between iron and mortality in more than 58000 patients receiving hemodialysis reported no increased death rate from serum ferritin levels as high as 1200 ng / ml.30 the increasing cost of therapy in patients with cancer is of grave concern  which could be an additional benefit of iv iron over the use of esas in such patients . to further address many of the questions raised  
 our team is planning a bigger trial for iv iron in patients with cancer who have anemia to confirm the results discussed in this pilot trial . 
 in addition  we will be looking into predictors of response to iv iron  such as serum hepcidin level . 
 iv iron therapy alone is safe and may be effective in improving hb levels in patients with cancer who are undergoing active anticancer therapy . 
 further randomized trials are needed to address many of the questions raised in our pilot study .","

Abstract:
This study aimed to assess the efficacy of intravenous iron therapy in patients with cancer and non-iron-deficiency anemia undergoing chemotherapy. The results showed a significant increase in hemoglobin levels without any severe adverse events.

Research and Discussion:
Intravenous iron therapy with ferric sucrose was given weekly for 12 weeks to 25 patients with solid cancers and non-iron-deficiency anemia. The mean change in hemoglobin levels after 9 treatments was 1.7 g/dl, and after 12 treatments, it was 2.1 g/dl. This suggests that intravenous iron therapy may be an effective alternative to blood transfusions for these patients.

Results and Conclusion:
Of the 25 patients, 19 completed at least 3 iron infusions and 14 completed the full 12 weeks of therapy. Five patients required blood transfusions and were considered treatment failures. No adverse events related to the intravenous iron were reported. This study suggests that intravenous iron therapy alone may reduce transfusion requirements and improve hemoglobin levels in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings."
